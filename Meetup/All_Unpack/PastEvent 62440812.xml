It is located within Baxter State Park, a wilderness-managed area in which humans come second that some refer to as the 51st state. The mountain, being a mile above sea level, towers above the comparatively low Maine lakes and forests. Due to the northerly latitude, timberline is at about 3,500 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katahdin is most impressive from the south, a sheer-like granite fortress towering to the heights. It's shape is somewhat horseshoe-like with the open end heading northeasterly. Click this link to see an excellent overview photo.There are 5 main peaks on the horseshoe, counterclockwise from the north they go: Howe Peak, Hamlin Peak, Baxter Peak (summit), South Peak and Pamola Peak. The most dominant and intimidating feature on Katahdin is the Knife Edge, an appropriately-named jagged arete only a few feet wide in places and a memorable traverse from South Peak to Pamola Peak. Katahdin is climbed frequently, being a popular destination because of its prestige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katahdin would appear to be volcanic in origin with it's cirques resembling craters (view from the northeast reminiscent of St. Helens somewhat) but it is actually granite that has been eroded away and carved by glaciers (source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The many routes to the summit all involve at least some scrambling from second to fourth class and come from three general directions, north, east and southwest. However there are several technical routes both rock and ice (refer to the Routes section for details). A campsite, Chimney Pond, sits within the cirque called the Great Basin. From this point, you can ascend the Cathedral Ridge Route (1.7 mi.) that runs up the salient ridge just west of Baxter Peak or the Saddle Trail (2.2 mi.) which is a bit more pedestrian. Or if you want to head up the Knife Edge (1.1 mi.) you would ascend the Dudley Trail to Pamola Peak (1.3 mi.). You can also head west from Chimney Pond to Hamlin Peak via the Hamlin Ridge Trail (2.2 mi.) if you want to hike the entire western side of the mountain to the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also climb directly from the east via the Roaring Brook Campground on the Helon Taylor Trail (4.3 mi to summit). This takes you directly to Pamola Peak and the Knife Edge route to the summit and bypasses Chimney Pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the southwest you can approach via Abol Campground or Katahdin Stream Campground which intersect and head up the Hunt Trail (the northernmost 5.5 miles of the AT). (5.2 mi total)&lt;/p&gt;
