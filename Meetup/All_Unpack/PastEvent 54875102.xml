&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for the MUD RUN???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       The details of the Warrior Dash have changed, and the event has been moved from Willington, to Thompson CT and is at the site of the previous Warrior Dash, and it is also now a 2 day event that is taking place on the 22nd and the 23rd. I am signed up for the 3 p.m. time slot on the 22nd, and the time slots for that day are now full. With nearly 12k taking part in this event you will see everyone from the hardline competitor to those wearing a wedding dress taking part, and the Warrior Dash is a 3.1 mile event with 12 very doable obstacles, but that Warrior wall is still 15 ft high!When you click on the link below you can find a video that can tell you what it is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       I am probably going to suggest the stage as a designation for the meetup prior to and or after the event, because in Thompson this was a small area where people could find one another. I am also trying to organize this event along with the Providence biking andrecreation group.&lt;/p&gt;
