This educational program will knock you out!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of you have heard of or read best selling books like Nothing Down as well as any book by any of the well known charlatans. Most authors explore the concepts of marketing illusion to idiots( I admit I am one of the idiots). Annie will enlighten our group on how these concepts really work for the average homeowner as well as the seasoned real estate investor. These are the pro's in New England that are creating millionaires out of average homeowners!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us understand that buying is better that renting but few are able to connect the dots in turning house wealth into true wealth. Isn't it time you became wealthy?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will fill up fast. If you are interested, please respond now. I don't want you to be disappointed, by being shut out. dale  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Several of us who have profited from this material, will be on hand to tell our stories.  &lt;br /&gt;P.P.S. I will forward another email with her full bio  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PPPS. Networking can be the most valuable part of these meetings. Unfortunately, I have promised to be out of the room by 9pm. Those folks who have arrived early to meet people, can tell you of the value of coming early.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dale</member_name><member_id>3116571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216904274000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>37</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204592750000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club April Meeting</name><id>7457252</id><headcount>38</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207609200000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/7457252/</event_url></item>
