<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This Thursday is supposed to be pretty cold following Sandey, so we'd love to have our friends come over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of things you should know in advance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- We have 3 cats. People with mild allergies have been able to hang out with no problem, but if you are very allergic, leave a comment and we'll find an alternate place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- There is no parking on my side of the street starting about 50' from my door (we're on a one-way st). It is usually pretty easy to find parking during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- You can always just take the T, we are pretty close to Ashmont on the Red line.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yooree Losordo</member_name><member_id>7915117</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351787498000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351205000000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Korean playgroup - SoBo</name><id>dggbgdyqpbcb</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351776600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/88583662/</event_url></item>
