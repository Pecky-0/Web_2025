The game starts at 2pm sharp. You may want to arrive a bit early if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Bring your calculators&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Bring your favorite pencils and erasers (if you have them). We do provide pencils and erasers, but some people are just picky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of metered parking on Huntington Ave, and it's free since it's Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, please keep up your RSVP count.  It really does help make things easier.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dodge Hall, in a classroom on the LEFT after entering</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236534322000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232067589000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February 22 Cashflow Meetup</name><id>9533664</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235329200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/9533664/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
