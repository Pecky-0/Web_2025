Join us for a repeat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us on Sunday, July 17, from 10:30 a.m. until 12 noon for a
walk on a paved walking/jogging trail in Woodbridge followed by
optional lunch. Fitzgerald Trails is located at 100 Center Road in
Woodbridge, Connecticut, and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of parking at the
Woodbridge Town Library at 10 Newton Road. If you stand in front of
the library with the entrance behind you, in front of you will be
the main parking lot and across the street you will see a white
building with green trim. Walk to the street (which is Center Road)
and cross to the other side of the street where the white building
is. Turn left and walk about 50 yards.The walking trail will be on
your right. We will meet on the walking trail adjacent to Center
Road. If you arrive after 10:30 a.m., just wait at this location
and you will see us in a few minutes as we walk around the track.
You can also try calling Manny Ratafia on his cell phone at
203-901-9553 or Nina Stein on her cell phone at 203-215-0022.
Afterward, some of us will go to a nearby diner or other restaurant
for lunch. The event will be canceled in the event of rain. If in
