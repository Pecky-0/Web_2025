It will be more of a walk in the woods than a serious hike as we'll cover 2-3 miles of rolling trails, likely with views of Rainbow Reservoir. I will choose a different route than we did on Monday. Meet in the parking lot at 2:00 and expect to be out on the trail 1-2 hours at a social (slow) pace. Kids and dogs welcome.  (Sorry for the last minute notice, I was waiting on weather forecast and other family members' plans...)&lt;/p&gt;
