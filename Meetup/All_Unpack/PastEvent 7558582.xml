After most of the elevation gain is completed to reach Signal Ridge, hikers are rewarded by the sudden spectacular views for a delightful mile of easy ridge walking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have a  short descent into the woods and a short ascent up to the 4700' bald summit with sensational views of 43 4000 footers in NH and scores of mountains in Maine &amp;amp; Vermont. The stunning views from the open summit and tower are contenders for the finest views in all the Whites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The round trip is 10.0 miles, 3250' of elevation gain, with 7 - 7.5 hours on the trail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead: Sawyer River Road about 2.1 miles from US Route 302, elevation about 1400 feet&lt;br /&gt;44.0704°N, 71.3830°W (WGS84)&lt;br /&gt;WMNF fee site&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From I-93 exit 35 near Franconia Notch, follow US Route 3 about 11 miles N to the junction of US Route 302 in Twin Mountain, then turn R on US Route 302 and go E about 19 miles through Crawford Notch to the Sawyer River Road. (This is about 10 miles W of NH Route 16 at Glen.) Go up the Sawyer River Road 2.1 miles, the trail starts on the R just before the Whiteface Brook bridge and the parking lot is on the L across the bridge.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213102388000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><why>It's June and if you'd like to see some wild orchids, they should be in bloom at this time.
