I was involved in directing a show that night and didn't get a message out in time saying to show up and play some games without me or Nikki who was sick.  Sounds like you all stilll had a fun time though! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto this evening, I've been a bit under the weather as well but feeling a bit more chipper today, I thought it would be great to sneak an incubator in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So everyone knows what a flash mob is right? So let's make tonight a Flash Incubator! Come on out, let's play, let's laugh, let's relax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always no improv or acting experience required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so I know how many of you to expect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go through a great mix of warm ups, exercises, and games!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions? Let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293223501000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293116319000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flash Incubator!
