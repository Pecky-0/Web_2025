Come see the famous Ball drop in Times Square!! It really is something you never forget! My favorite memory was the mounted-cop-driven Human Tidal Wave of Certain Doom That You Mysteriously Live Through. This year Will is determined to go see it all up close, and neither rain nor sleet nor a mob of drunken New Yorkers will stop him! He's put together some great details below.  Come join in the thrill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will is the contact for this event. His phone number is 860-227-4775.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Being my first year living in the east coast I want to go to Times Square for New Years Eve. I am looking to see if anyone would like to come with me. I plan on taking the metro north from Union Station and arriving in downtown Manhattan. We’ll meet at the New Haven Union station at 11:30 am on WED Dec 31 to buy tickets. Tickets are $14.00 one way. The train leaves at 11:57 and arrives in Manhattan at 1:40 pm. Don’t be late! I am told we must come early to get a good viewing spot in Times Square. We’ll wait in Time Square until midnight and enjoy the festivities until the ball drops to bring in the New Year. Most likely we will take the next train leaving Grand Central around 1 am at the end of the night. There will be plenty of trains running all night every hour leaving New York, but exact times haven’t been posted yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      It will be good to have many people in our group so that people can reserve our spot while others use restrooms and find food. Bring warm cloths, as we will be outside most of the day. Also bring some spending cash for food and drink and don’t forget your camera. From what I am told everyone needs to experience New Years Eve in New York at least once. It’s possible that we might stay and find some type of after party if anyone knows of any, or we might split up if some people want to go home after the ball drop. We’ll see how everyone feels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions Call Me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will 860-227-4775 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: $28 for train fair plus spending cash for Manhattan and parking around Union Station New Haven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: New Haven Union Station&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;50 Union Avenue, New Haven, CT&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I’ll be waiting inside the train station) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 11:30 AM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timessquarenyc.org/nye/nye.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.timessquar...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Train Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://as0.mta.info/mnr/schedules/sched_form.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://as0.mta.info/m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METRO-INFO (1-800-638-7646)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231012576000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229117028000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The BIGGEST party of them all...the Ball Drop in Times Square!</name><id>9328637</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230741000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9328637/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
