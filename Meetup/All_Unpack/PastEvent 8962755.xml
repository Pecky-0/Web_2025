I now know the movie time, 7:45. I suggest you buy tickets ahead of time at Fandango.com.

I will be in the theater lobby 45 minutes before showtime, which would be 7:00. I'll send people into the line as soon as I can, and the first group will try and save some seats for the rest and hopefully we'll all sit together, without making our fellow movie goers too angry.  If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables near the window. If downstairs, I'll be behind the rope where the tickets are torn across from the popcorn stand. 

Since it is no longer opening weekend, I'm not as concerned about the crowd and sitting together. And it looks like some folks have switched from "yes" to "maybe". But this was the #1 movie last week!


[b]Original Description[/b]

Daniel Craig is back as James Bond, and I say, the best James Bond ever! Better than Sean Connery! Yes I said that! 

The plot of this film continues where the last one left off, see the synopsis for details.

This film will be huge! So that means you should buy your tickets online ahead of time at fandango.com, and you should arrive early to the theater.

I am proud to say that this group got 30 people into the latest Indiana Jones film, which of course was completely sold out, and we all sat together, taking up two rows. We can do it again!

I strongly suggest buying your ticket ahead of time at fandango.com. Be sure to pick the right date! It's a Saturday! I'll be wearing my red hat with the meetup logo. For new folks, if you miss the gathering before the film, no worries, we regroup after the film just outside the room where the film shows. And then we go out to discuss the movie over munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

"Quantum of Solace" continues the high octane adventures of James Bond (Daniel Craig) in "Casino Royale."

Betrayed by Vesper, the woman he loved, 007 fights the urge to make his latest mission personal. Pursuing his determination to uncover the truth, Bond and M (Judi Dench) interrogate Mr White (Jesper Christensen) who reveals the organisation which blackmailed Vesper is far more complex and dangerous than anyone had imagined.

Forensic intelligence links an Mi6 traitor to a bank account in Haiti where a case of mistaken identity introduces Bond to the beautiful but feisty Camille (Olga Kurylenko), a woman who has her own vendetta. Camille leads Bond straight to Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a ruthless business man and major force within the mysterious organisation.

On a mission that leads him to Austria, Italy and South America, Bond discovers that Greene, conspiring to take total control of one of the world's most important natural resources, is forging a deal with the exiled General Medrano (Joaquin Cosio). Using his associates in the organisation, and manipulating his powerful contacts within the CIA and the British government, Greene promises to overthrow the existing regime in a Latin American country, giving the General control of the country in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of land.

In a minefield of treachery, murder and deceit, Bond allies with old friends in a battle to uncover the truth. As he gets closer to finding the man responsible for the betrayal of Vesper, 007 must keep one step ahead of the CIA, the terrorists and even M, to unravel Greene's sinister plan and stop his organisation.

[b]Trailer[/b]

There are a lot of trailers floating around but I like this one the best. But the opening date at the end is wrong - this movie opens Nov 14!
