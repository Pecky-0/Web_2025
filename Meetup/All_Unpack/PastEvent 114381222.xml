&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Remember back in March when we went to paint bowls???  Well this is the event that you will either get your bowl or another and help a great cause!!!!  Even if you didn't paint a bowl, consider coming out to help support this great event! For a minimum donation of $15.00 for this amount of money this is what you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meal is simple:  &lt;br /&gt;

Soup, bread, beverage and a cookie! The bowl goes home as an unspoken reminder that somewhere someone’s bowl is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cost: $15.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Time:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;I have this time as 5:00, but the event runs until 8:00, if you are not able to make it at the Meetup time, but want to come to the event, put in your RSVP what time you will be coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parking:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;There is a free trolley with free parking that meets at Good Harbor Beach,  it is on Thatcher Road in Gloucester.  You can leave from there and meet us at the event OR park at the event.  Please note the parking may be a little tight at Cruiseport so be prepared for that, there may also be parking on the street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This event will be scheduled on my 2 Meetup sites, (Our Circle of Friends and Connection &amp;amp; Friends) there may be more people going to this event then you see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are running late, can’t find us or need to cancel at the last minute, you already have it in your phone:  978-304-2811, please note this phone does not accept text messages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time for you to pay your dues?  Please look at your profile page where it states “Membership dues last recorded by your Organizer” You can pay your dues at any event.  Thank you in advance for paying your dues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a courtesy to everyone in the group come back to the event page and change your RSVP if your plans change or call me/send a message through the site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing you at this event!&lt;/p&gt;
