&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Rick's Roadhouse - in the Jewelry/Knowledge District (either one, depending how long you've lived in PVD), near Olga's Cup &amp;amp; Saucer and across the street from The Apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick's Roadhouse is a big, open industrial-feeling space with a large bar and lots o' BBQ! They also have just about something for everyone AND various entertaining games such as pool, pinball and corn hole. There are huge garage doors that open out to a large patio with relaxed picnic table seating. A big plus for catching the evening breezes and/or avoiding the sudden pop-up rain shower! I can't believe its been over a year since we've had an official Monday Night at Ricks!!!  So, let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a friend!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Bob is hosting this one!
