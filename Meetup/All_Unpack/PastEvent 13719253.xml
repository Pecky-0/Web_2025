A few people had to drop out and some people just didn't know what they were missing!  So we are going to start all over back to week 1 for anyone who wants to join us to try running.  No pressure, go at your own pace.  Just join 15-20 other group members twice a week at the track.  If you want to run, start training or walk... we are here!  Please join us every and any Monday and Wednesday night at BHS.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get everyone ready for a 5K, event we will be posting training events using the &amp;quot;Couch to 5K&amp;quot; training schedule. When more options are available, I will find some 5K events to post on the calendar for our &amp;quot;final exam&amp;quot;. :)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(we will be meeting twice a week for those who are training, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Friday or Saturday to keep with the schedule)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolrunnin...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1 we are starting from scratch. Remember to bring your sneakers and some water! And if it is really hot, a towel isn't a bad idea either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couch to 5K, Week 1 Plan: (3x during the week)  &lt;br /&gt;Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes.  &lt;br /&gt;Don't worry, I'll bring the stop watch with the whistle so everyone knows when to start and stop the jogging.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday, July 12th  &lt;br /&gt;6:30pm  &lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School  &lt;br /&gt;Track  &lt;br /&gt;Meet at the entrance by the bleachers  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer: Julie &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: none  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by NOON on Monday, July 12th  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.
