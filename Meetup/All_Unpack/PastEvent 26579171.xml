 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Wooded trails wind through the varied terrain of Noon Hill, making it perfect for hiking. At 370 feet, Noon Hill rises gently above the surrounding landscape. Follow the short trail that leads to its peak and you'll be rewarded with sweeping views south across the rolling hills of Walpole and Norfolk. A loop trail around Holt Pond gives you a wonderful opportunity to explore freshwater habitat.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;A short trail extension across Causeway Street connects Noon Hill to 
&lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/places-to-visit/greater-boston/shattuck-reservation.html"&gt;Shattuck Reservation&lt;/a&gt;. Both reservations are managed with adjacent conservation land owned by the Town of Medfield.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;This is a great place for wildflowers. The properties and surrounding lands provide habitat for white-tailed deer, red fox, raccoon, and ruffed grouse.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Thousands of years ago, glacial action carved depressions through the hill. Exposed bedrock along the tops of the ridges is further evidence of the glacial activity that shaped the land. The reservation's slopes and ridges are forested with pine, beech, birch, and hemlock. From the height of Noon Hill, the land slopes gently toward the Charles River and its tributary, the Stop River. Many lowland areas have become red maple swamps, and much of the land to the north and east of the Reservation is floodplain of the Stop River, a tributary of the Charles River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 4.5 miles of trails. Moderate hiking, strenuous in places. Noon Hill is a link in the Bay Circuit Trail.
