&lt;p&gt;Herb Pearce will be doing a special workshop about people who are Type 5 (The Knowledge Seeker) on the Enneagram of Personality. Here is a description of the event from Herb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Learn all about 5s and strengths and defenses. Learn about all the subtypes of 5, personal growth strategies, relationship dynamics in relationship to 5s. Fine to come if you are in relationship to a 5, want to learn about 5s or be more like a 5! We take a pause a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;9:30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt; if you need to leave early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;7:30-10:00pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Herb always has great snacks. Great food, company and an interesting topic - an awesome way to spend a Thursday night!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301026336000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299115212000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Special Workshop about the Enneagram Type 5 (The Knowledge Seeker)</name><id>16775565</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301009400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/16775565/</event_url></item>
