We will have a meetup sign for our group and will set up an area facing the stage to the right as close to the front as possible! There are booths set up with free food and other stuff right near the esplanade from 4 till around 6. It really is a lot of fun!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Temptations&lt;br /&gt;Hometown and year formed: Detroit, circa 1960&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soul Mates:&lt;br /&gt;The group's original lineup consisted of Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Otis Williams (no relation to Paul), Elbridge Bryant and Melvin Franklin, a fusion of members from Detroit-area vocal acts the Primes and the Distants. The quintet initially performed as the Elgins and changed its moniker to the Temptations before signing with Motown's Miracle label around 1961. Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin in 1964, the same year the group scored a No. 11 Billboard pop hit on Motown's Gordy imprint with the Smokey Robinson-penned &amp;quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Voices:&lt;br /&gt;Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by former Contours singer Dennis Edwards. The '70s and '80s saw many lineup changes, most notably the departures of Kendricks and Paul Williams in 1971. Otis Williams is the only original member still with the Temptations. The group's most recent efforts include 2000's Ear-Resistible, 2001's Awesome and 2004's Legacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chart Smashes:&lt;br /&gt;The various lineups of the Temptations placed more than 50 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart between 1964 and 1991.
