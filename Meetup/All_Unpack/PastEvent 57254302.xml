We'll be near Blue Back Square in West Hartford, Saturday April 7th from 12noon until at 4pm. This is a new location for us - the idea is that we'll have more foot traffic here than at most other sign wave locations so we can get more literature out to the public. Depending on the turnout we may have a group waving at the intersection while another is on Super Brochure distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of garaged parking in the area and 160 metered on the road spots. It may require a bit of walking to get to the busiest intersection but it shouldn't be too bad. Garage parking is .75 cent per half hour with a max charge of $7. There are parking garages on Isham Street and one on Memorial Road in the Blue Back vicinity. The address listed in the meetup is for the square and will get you to the area for garage or street parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the planned sign wave location at the intersection of Farmington Ave and S Main St a few blocks from the square:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know about others, but I don't ever see myself giving up on freedom in this country - not now and not even if things get worse. Look at the big picture and what our long-term goals are - if we are waking people up to reality then we are winning, period. Rigged elections and controlled media aside - it matters not once the seed of liberty has been planted. See everyone there and as always please call 860-730-3RON if you need directions or help finding us.&lt;/p&gt;
