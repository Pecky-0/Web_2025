As part of their Music on Film series, the MFA is screening Sound of the Soul by Stephen Olsson (2005, 68 min.)  this Sunday at 10:30 am. These early morning MFA films- you either got to love 'em or hate 'em! This documentary is rather short and may serve well as an introduction to a  variety of  music sensibilities. It also seems like a great way to start the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sound of the Soul transports viewers on an exhilarating cinematic journey to North Africa. The film begins with the historic city of Fez: its heritage of tolerance as an ancient sanctuary for Muslim, Jewish, and Christian inhabitants; its Islamic foundations; and evocative medieval sites. It is the ideal location for an exceptional festival bringing together a unique array of musicians: a transcendent chorus of African Berber women, a Portuguese Fado singer; a French early music ensemble; players and vocalists from Afghanistan, England, Russia, Ireland, Mauritania, and Turkey; and a gospel band from Harlem. All are blended with unforgettable Moroccan Sufi performers and connected through their artistry by profound expressions of love and longing.
