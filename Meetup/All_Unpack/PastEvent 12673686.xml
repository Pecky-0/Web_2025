It is one piece of a research project, &lt;i&gt;Can Maine Feed Itself&lt;/i&gt;, that identifies the Maine food pyramid and components of a sustainable food system.  In addition to her research project, Wixson will discuss strategies to put food security within our reach.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is &lt;a href="http://www.une.edu/admissions/upload/wccmap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Campus Map&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.une.edu/admissions/upload/wccparking.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Parking Map&lt;/a&gt; for the UNE Portland Campus. &lt;br /&gt;$3-5 Suggested Donation at the Door to cover our speaker's travel expenses to come down; No one turned away for lack of funds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This will not be a potluck event but feel free to come anytime after 6:30 for some social time followed by the start of the presentation around 7pm.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cheryl Wixson grew up on a dairy farm in Winslow, Maine. She is a third generation graduate of the University of Maine, and is the University's first woman agricultural engineer. After 10 years in the pulp and paper and telecommunications industry, Wixson founded a catering company and small restaurant that served international cuisine featuring organic Maine products. The last meal served at her restaurant was a nine-course meal featuring Petunia, Wixson's pig, that achieved international notoriety when code enforcement determined it was residing illegally in the same neighborhood as novelist Stephen King. Cheryl then retired from the restaurant business to bake cookies and raise crops, rabbits and three daughters on her organic, urban farm in Bangor. In 1999, Wixson built a state-of-the art kitchen and educational facility dedicated to teaching people the joys and benefits of healthy eating and cooking utilizing Maine products while supporting a sustainable environment. Cheryl is a food columnist for the Bangor Daily News, consults with restaurants from Maine to California, develops recipes for food manufacturers and hosted two Maine Public Television series, the latest being What's for Suppah?. She has studied food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine, is a master composter, and teaches kindergarten children that food comes from farms.  Cheryl is an Organic Marketing Consultant for MOFGA.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269700408000</updated><rating><average>4.67999982834</average><count>19</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>93</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266861524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March Meetup: The "Maine Local 20" with Cheryl Wixson</name><id>12673686</id><headcount>80</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268778600000</time><rsvp_limit>100</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/12673686/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/9/global_6726105.jpeg</photo_url></item>
