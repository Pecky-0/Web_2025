A little research found them to be the work of Harold Edgarton, an electrical engineer at MIT. He had taken the pictures using a strobe light he developed. The amazing photographs included one of a speeding bullet. Even more surprising was their worth - Sotheby's expected them to sell for $6,000 - $9,000 at auction.&lt;br /&gt;(link: &lt;a href="http://www.prlog.org/10032262-50-cent-tag-sale-discovery-excites-worldwide-photo-collector-market.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.prlog.org/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can you tell if there is treasure in your clutter?
