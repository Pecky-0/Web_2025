Our book club is meeting on Saturday, May 18 at Sandy's Condo in Mansfield. The book selection for May is A TIME IN BETWEEN by Maria Duenas. It is available in paperback. &lt;br /&gt;

At age twelve, Sira Quiroga sweeps the atelier floors where her single mother works as a seamstress. By her early twenties she has learned the ropes of the business and is engaged to a modest government clerk. But then everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Spanish Civil War brewing in Madrid, Sira impetuously follows her handsome new lover to Morocco, but soon finds herself abandoned, penniless, and heartbroken. She reinvents herself by turning to the one skill that can save her: creating beautiful clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As World War II begins, Sira is persuaded to return to Madrid, where she is the preeminent couturiere for an eager clientele of Nazi officers’ wives. She becomes embroiled in a half-lit world of espionage and political conspiracy rife with love, intrigue, and betrayal. A massive bestseller across Europe, The Time In Between is one of those rare, richly textured novels that enthrall down to the last page. MarÍa DueÑas reminds us how it feels to be swept away by a masterful storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 11:00 and a light brunch will be served. Looking forward to seeing everyone and discussing the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy B.</member_name><member_id>11339653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368901547000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>425314</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Jewish Singles 55+  of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363643955000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book Club Saturday, May 18 @ Sandy's condo</name><id>109895072</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368889200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston/events/109895072/</event_url></item>
