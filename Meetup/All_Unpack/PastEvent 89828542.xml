&lt;p&gt;And while we're at it, let the dogs run on the roads surrounding the farms of Old Historic Deerfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lovely area with beautiful views of expanse farmland and mountains to the west and east.  It is on the bank of the Deerfield River so this is prime land for farming.  Now is the time when the farming season is inactive so the fields are open to allow the dogs to run and play.  From what I have seen, others also think this is a great place for walking, jogging, and letting the dogs RUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the maps, this can be a loop walk or just go up and back on the same path.  In any case, just following the dirt roads that wind through the fields will be fun for everyone.  Where we will meet is at the end of the road called Broughams Pond Road just after the trees.  There are 2 ponds right where we will park and meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions are to head towards Old Historic Deerfield from routes 5&amp;amp;10.  The road to take is not labeled but the name of the road is Main St and it intersects with routes 5&amp;amp;10.  It is the northern-most part of Main St in Old Historic Deerfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If coming from Greenfield, head south on routes 5&amp;amp;10 until you see the first brown sign on the right for Old Historic Deerfield.  Take that right.  Stay straight on this road and &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;do not&lt;/span&gt; take a left into Old Historic Deerfield.  The road now becomes Broughams Pond Road.  You will see a house at a Y intersection with signs that point to the right for athletic fields BUT STAY TO THE LEFT of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If coming from Northampton, head north on route 5 until you get into Deerfield.  Look for the brown Old Historic Deerfield signs on the left.  Take any of them and take a right onto Main St in Old Historic Deerfield.  Go to the northern most end of Main St until you are forced to go left or right.  Take a left.  You will very soon see the house at a Y intersection with signs that point to the right for athletic fields BUT STAY TO THE LEFT of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just past the house is the view in the picture for this meetup.  Go past the treeline and park on the side of the road.  Be careful not to make any tire damage to the farmland.&lt;/p&gt;
