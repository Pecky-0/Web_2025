It's on Crown Street between High and College. There wasn't a sign on the building as of 11/13 but there is a menu out front so it was easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Yale Daily News review:&lt;br /&gt;The food is upgraded grill fare with a Southwest flavor (chili peppers) and the bar is an imposing U-shaped structure armed to the teeth with the liquors of Mexico. The menu boasts inventive drinks such as the passion fruit-jalapeno margarita, 85 kinds of Tequila, a good wine list from California and South America, some microbrews from the Southwest (the Flying Dog Ale is very good) and Mezcal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRINK SPECIALS: &lt;br /&gt;From Ed: Geronimo will do $3 Tecate beers and $5 margaritas for us.  Pretty good, their margaritas are usually $9-14 and beers are $5+!   So this is a great chance to check this&lt;br /&gt;place out and still watch the budget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact info: Ed 203-583-9668&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196089815000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194651109000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday 11/19 HH at Geronimo</name><id>6711969</id><headcount>34</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195513200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6711969/</event_url></item>
