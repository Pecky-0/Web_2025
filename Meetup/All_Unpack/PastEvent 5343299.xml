<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>As we decided at our last meeting we will continue with Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. (We plan to wrap up Nietzsche with 3 meetings on Thus Spoke Zarathustra plus one meeting on the Uses and Misuses of History.) In the second part of Walter Kaufmann's book (which is called The Portable Nietzsche) Thus Spoke Zarathustra is from pages 103 through 440. Let's have the first book (and editor's preface etc...) pages from 103 through 191 for this first meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Line let me reserve the back room for January 4th. Let's meet there, however please watch for your e-mail because they may reconsider by the time I plan to confirm it. In the event of a last minute change you do not find any philosophers in the Red Line after 7:15pm, then we are in the Bombay Club next door upstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays and New Years.&lt;br /&gt;See you soon,&lt;br /&gt;Andras&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168128586000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1166898327000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra</name><id>5343299</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1167955200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5343299/</event_url></item>
