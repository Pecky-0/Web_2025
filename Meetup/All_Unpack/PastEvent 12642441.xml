The trail starts almost directly across from the parking lot. It is one of the easier 4000 footers to hike. It is 7.2 miles roundtrip.  Read AMC book description for more details. You will need to bring snowshoes, and either microspikes or crampons in case there is a lot of ice. It's a lovely hike through the woods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will promptly at 8:15am. I'm driving a silver Subaru Legacy. I hike on the slower side but people can hike whatever speed they want, as long as we touch base periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is closed to new RSVP's, at 13 people. For those who said Yes, please make sure you are still comimg to the hike. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Winter parking across from the trailhead.
