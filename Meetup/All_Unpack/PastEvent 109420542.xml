&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Depending on how many people we get to help, one of the projects we could possibly accomplish in a few hours would be clearing the bike paths clean of all the deadfall.  We may also try to clear trees from paths that have been cut by DCR crews. (We aren't allowed to use power tools ourselves so don't bring them.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us if you are able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to make it for the morning start, we would still love your help at any point in the day.   We will provide cell contact info for people who sign up.  Please bring your lunch and water. Bring work gloves and loppers, clippers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone who works with us will be able to look forward to joining the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/104181992/"&gt;Woodcock Walk&lt;/a&gt; and BBQ at the end of the day. If the hot dogs don't entice you, watching Glenn swoop around the amphitheater should be a great reward for a good day of work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
