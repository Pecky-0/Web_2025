Sagra is located 1 short block from the Red Line Station. Some of those groups include my Red Sox Natives, the Skidaddlers Ski and Sports Club, Social Fun, and The Booze Club. Some of us will be there earlier in the evening for another event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome. Last time we did this over 30 people showed up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is free except for what you drink and/or eat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to maintain your own bar tab or pay in cash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will all be at the bar. Ask for Kathy B.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265501088000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264548153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Alternative Happy Hour with Multiple Groups at Sagra</name><id>12432458</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265328000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/12432458/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/6/9/global_6298201.jpeg</photo_url></item>
