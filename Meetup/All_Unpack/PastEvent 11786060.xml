This will be the final dry land training for the pre-season.  after this we will spend most of the weekends up north and the weekdays wishing we were up north. The workout is great for anyone who wants to get in shape, you do not have to be a skier or racer. All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob will lead the group in Plyometric based training methods designed to get the leg muscles and core ready for the season. This is the same workout that he has used for many years to prepare for ski racing. There is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is our final workout Bob has requested that anyone who has some to any of the previous workouts to at least come by the post workout celebration.   We will do our typical beer and food at a pub but Bob has some awards and surprises  planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear work-out clothes and athletic shoes with some ankle support.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the center of the common.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259278626000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257285212000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Final Ski Fitness</name><id>11786060</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259105400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/11786060/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/b/5/global_10414789.jpeg</photo_url></item>
