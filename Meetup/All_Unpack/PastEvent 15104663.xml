Mutants, robots, and space aliens all roam the wasteland that once was Earth. (Well, many earths. Well, many planetesque things called various names but vaguely resembling what we perceive as Earth.)&lt;br /&gt;A castoff from a destroyed planet in the weirdest reaches of space, the meteorite of earth and vegetation crashed in a shattered city near the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Misguided creatures from a technology-free reality, the gren, came to worship the creature and to call it the Returned Earth. The lump of sentient rock won’t be satisfied until it has obliterated all technology by sending a destructive signal through a large metal spire within the city. A patrol comes to capture the characters and drain their blood to nourish the Returned Earth (it’s complicated). Can these mutants survive the initial attack? Will they strike back at the Returned Earth? Is life even worth living if they don’t have their technology?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to build some buzz for Gamma World Game Day and provide those a little curious a chance to colloquially try before they buy, Dale and I will be running the convention special Gamma World module offered originally at Pax Prime and New York Comic Con.  There is no cost to attend this event, but there are benefits.  Anyone who comes to this event will have the benefit of playing their character at level 2 if they come to the Gamma World Game Day as well.  In addition, if you choose to buy at least two booster packs for your character at this event, you will be considered to have prepaid admission for the Game Day; in other words, you can come to the Game Day for free.  That way, you get at least two uses of the alpha mutations and omega tech cards for two different adventures, and have your character carry over (unless of course you'd rather he get reduced to a puddle of radioactive sludge, which is fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is sufficient interest, I'm considering starting a Gamma World campaign after the Game Day.  Details are to follow, but I need to see sufficient interest from people (by coming to the two already scheduled events, for instance) if I am to do so.  See you guys in the glorious wasteland that has become Gamma Terra.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287708045000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287025947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D Gamma World:  Pax Extraterrestria</name><id>15104663</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287615600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/15104663/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
