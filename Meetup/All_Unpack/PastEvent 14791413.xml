Last year's party was a huge success.  We invite everyone to come in full costume to play music, fill yourselves with food and spirits (punny, I know) and have a great time.  We will be raffling off gift cards and discounts to Cassidy's, and we will be finishing the event with a costume contest with prizes.  This event will run from 7:30 -9:30 with music sign ups at 7:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you all in your best attire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much,&lt;br /&gt;The AC Team &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter and Rhiannon </member_name><member_id>6208546</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288399682000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>acousticcafe</urlname><id>1539383</id><group_lat>42.8899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3000030518</group_lon><name>The Acoustic Cafe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284648880000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cassidy's Open Mic Halloween Party!</name><id>14791413</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288395000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/acousticcafe/events/14791413/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/6/global_13865814.jpeg</photo_url></item>
