Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 100 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 9 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 9:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;* Route 8 south (from Waterbury)&lt;br /&gt;* Get off at Exit 24.  At end of the ramp,  turn right.&lt;br /&gt;* Proceed south a short distance and turn right to go over the metal bridge. &lt;br /&gt;* Proceed to Cold Springs Rd. and turn right (Kevin comment: think this means right off of bridge onto Railroad Ave., then right onto lopus Rd., then road turns into Cold Springs Rd.).&lt;br /&gt;* Proceed approximately 1 1/2 mles along the railroad tracks (Kevin comment: think Cold Spring Rd. turns into High Rock Rd. after only .35 mile). &lt;br /&gt;* At the top of the hill,  park on your left and join other hikers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions via Mapquest (within 1 mile on same road, hard to pin down exact location):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=299+Cold+Springs+Rd&amp;amp;city=Beacon+Falls&amp;amp;state=CT" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
