To see more details and view a trailer go to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.go.com/happily-never-after/d851886/family" target="_blank"&gt;http://movies.go.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 7:20 PM so lets meet in the usual spot in front of the escalators at 6:50 with tickets in hand.   We want to be able to all sit together, if possible.   Remember, it is opening weekend for this movie, so you might want to buy your tickets ahead of time.    I bought mine on Fandango just now.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually grab a bite and/or a drink after the show.....bring suggestions of places you might want to go to after the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are new to the group....the escalators I mentioned are in the lobby near the entrance.  I wear a dorky little badge with a cartoon movie projector on it that says Boston/Medford Movie Group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doreen ;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168301238000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1166386171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happily N'ever After</name><id>5332709</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168128000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5332709/</event_url></item>
