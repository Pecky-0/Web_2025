Be a part of the show as the cast takes suggestions from the audience and turns them into comedy sketches. The show will be at the Hard Rock Cafe at Fanuil Hall. The old Hard Rock basement was the original location of the show so for the month of February, they go back to their roots while their theatre is under renovation. Tickets are $25.00. Purchase your ticket by calling 617-263-6887.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet for dinner ahead of time for those who are interested. If you are interested in dinner, make a note on your response.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nancy</member_name><member_id>8855931</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281130664000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263086214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Improv Asylum</name><id>12273819</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266633000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/12273819/</event_url></item>
