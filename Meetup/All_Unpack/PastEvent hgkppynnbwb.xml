Costumes are hoped for but are optional for those that cannot muster the effort. I am going to try to get a photographer to come but don't know for sure yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, everyone that attends can bring food or beverage to share with everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to combine this group, Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meet, and the Mass. Small Dog Breed Meet because we always meet together anyway, and Meetup.com charges us for two meets instead of only one because of the two groups. I am at a total loss as to what to call the combined group!!!! Please let me know what suggestions you have!!! I need your brainpower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to make the $5 per household a standard charge for every meetup so that we can pay for back and currentMeetup.com charges etc. Thanks for your contributions at the last meetup. They helped a lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my emails are working now, so if you want to write me, here they are! laptopmaltese@aol.com and robinberry519@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed the last meetup and look forward to seeing you all again on Oct. 17th!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small dog hugs, &lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287339867000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286146427000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BOSTON MALTESE &amp; TINY DOG Halloween MEET SUNDAY  Oct. 17th 1-4pm at the Meadows</name><id>hgkppynnbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287334800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/15035866/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/d/d/global_12130573.jpeg</photo_url></item>
