<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I've been wanting to go to Jacob Wirth for years, and just haven't been there yet. I heard they have a great beer selection did hear good things about their German food too.  &lt;br /&gt;It's in the Theater District and very close to Boston Common, and Boylston St (Green line) and Chinatown(Orange line) T stops. &lt;br /&gt;Parking lot is also available as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the second oldest restaurant in Boston and have the largest selection of imported beers on draft in the New England area, according to their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is their menu &lt;a href="http://www.jacobwirth.com/pages/menu_dinner.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jacobwirth...&lt;/a&gt; and you can also check out yelp reviews here. &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jacob-wirth-restaurant-boston" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to make a reservation, and scratched out the dinner idea. We can have snacks and drinks without having to sit down at a huge group table, and i can open up the number for more people! :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Sun (See pic) or call her (I'll email my cell # to the RSVPs)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248023074000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245040039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Drinks at Jacob Wirth</name><id>10653127</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246575600000</time><rsvp_limit>36</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/10653127/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/0/global_9162592.jpeg</photo_url></item>
