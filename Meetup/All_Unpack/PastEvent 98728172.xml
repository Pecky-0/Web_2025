 Project Cupid Plays Matchmaker for Valentine’s Day at the Fourth Annual Charity Date Auction at The Estate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston’s most eligible singles raise money for a worthy cause &lt;br /&gt;

 WHAT: Project Cupid will play matchmaker to raise money for pediatric leukemia research at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during its fourth annual charity date auction at The Estate. Boston’s most eligible bachelors and bachelorettes will strut their stuff at the top party spot in the city to raise funds for cancer care and research. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The evening will also feature a live auction, offering items including: sporting event tickets and signed memorabilia, hotel stays, salon gift packages and much more. Philanthropic partygoers will have the opportunity to donate to the cause by bidding on local stars such as the New England Revolution Girls and more. &lt;br /&gt;

 WHY: Project Cupid was created in 2009 by Amy Blue after the death of her nine-year-old cousin Isaias Valentin following his 11-month battle with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a cancer that begins in the bone marrow. All proceeds will benefit the AML research fund at Dana-Farber. &lt;br /&gt;

 WHO: Boston’s most eligible bachelors and bachelorettes, and singles looking to find a hot date for a good cause. &lt;br /&gt;

 WHEN: Saturday, February 9 &lt;br /&gt;

 Doors open at 6:00 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
