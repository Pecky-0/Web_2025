(art, history, and architecture).  The group has gone many times and it's always fun.  The theme for this evening, August 13, is NB Cultures.  When you look on the calendar (link below) you will see that there are many music performances tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the AHA! website: &lt;a href="http://www.ahanewbedford.org/calendar.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ahanewbedf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 6 at the visitor center and then decide what to do.  We will leave the visitor center by 6:15, so please try to be on time.  If you are going to be late, please call me and I will direct you to where we are. One idea is that there is a NB Preservation Trolley tour of historic mill sites.  Tours are at 6 and 7:15; 7:15 will probably be easier to do.  We'll check out some events and then grab dinner somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can park for free on the street after 6, or if you decide to come much earlier just bring a couple quarters for the meters.  My cell number is 773-304-8846, just in case you need to get ahold of me on the day of the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come out for a night of free entertainment!  Hope to see you there.  This is a joint event with WINGS.  Please RSVP on just one site.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for me in the lobby of the visitor center</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250805551000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249871652000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AHA! night in New Bedford</name><id>11074279</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250200800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/11074279/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
