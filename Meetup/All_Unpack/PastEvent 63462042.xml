It's like a casino/arcade. Walk around a modern, cool, huge arcade with a cocktail in hand. They have a restaurant there as well, so I'm thinking we will eat before hand and have some drinks and then play the games! If you would like to come for just dinner or just the games, that's cool too, just let me know in your RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-large"&gt;*****I will be asking for a table for the number of people who told me they are coming for dinner. If you haven't told me if you will be joining us for dinner or not, then you might not get to sit with us.******&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>LaurieS</member_name><member_id>14437585</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337526074000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336168703000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dave and Buster's!</name><id>63462042</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337468400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/63462042/</event_url></item>
