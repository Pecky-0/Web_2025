&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone will be wait listed and based on your experience&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;you will or will not be accepted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me five hours and forty-five minutes to do this yesterday, Sunday 3/17.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I was traveling alone and with the exception of gear changes did not stop.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I am estimating with a larger group it could take up to seven hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to meet at the Clinton Road parking lot approximately one-quarter mile past the AMC Highland Center if you are coming from the South.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; We will put on our skis and head down the Clinton Road toward Edmunds Path.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I did a trial run of this on Sunday, 3/17 and the distance from the parking lot to the Edmunds Path is two miles.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Took me about forty minutes to ski in.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; The road is broken out and there were no signs of snow mobiles on the road.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; There were several good XC tracks to follow on the road. You will be able to follow a track and track skis should be good.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You can use your hiking poles for ski poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we reach Edmunds Parking lot/Trail Head we will transition to hiking boots.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I carried my boots in my back pack and the changeover took about fifteen minutes.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; I left both skis and boots at the trail head with a note saying where I was going since I was alone.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; If people are concerned about the safety of their skis I will bring a big chain and lock for the skis and you could place your ski boots in your back pack.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail up to Eisenhower was packed out although snowshoes will be required.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Once I reached the top of the trail it had not been packed out and I had to break trail for approx. one mile to the summit. Still plenty of snow up there so be prepared. I carried but did not require the use of crampons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s forecast calls for windy conditions; we will gauge it as we ascend.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; If it’s too windy (above fifty MPH) we will turn around right at tree line.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; It was very windy yesterday but I did summit.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
