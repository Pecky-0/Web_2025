The core question put before our panelists will be:  How is intellectual property managed via the patent and/or licensing process as academic research moves from concept to commercialization?  The panel will be asked to bring meaningful examples to the discussion to emphasis the EntreTech Forum's focus on real-world inputs/outputs/incentives/issues. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keynote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stan Shurgin, Partner, Weingarten, Shurgin, Gagnebin &amp;amp; Lebovici &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Senior Managing Partner of the firm which he joined in 1967, Stan Schurgin's practice extends to all facets of intellectual property law.
