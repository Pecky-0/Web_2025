If the weather isn't conducive to beach portraits we'll turn it into a fog/weather shoot instead. There are several options open to us, regardless of weather, so come on up and we won't let Mother Nature spoil our day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting place is still Good Harbor Beach parking lot, at 5:15. We'll use that as our starting point and go from there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your patience and flexibility!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you have a tripod, be sure to bring it along just in case!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Family Portraits at the Beach!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; July 20, 2008 at 5:15PM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt;Good Harbor Beach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who is invited:&lt;/b&gt; Everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utilizing the softer afternoon/evening light, a Rockport or Gloucester (TBD) beach will serve as our backdrop for practicing beach portraiture.  We will break up into groups and take turns in the role of model and photographer.  If you'd like to get a jump on your Christmas card photos--bring the family along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beach portraits many favor dressing in all white or white shirts and khaki pants. Dress in whatever makes you comfortable, but do try to avoid bold prints and anything shiny or reflective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to bring: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Cameras&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the group with cameras!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216761524000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><why>CAPE Group members are friendly, helpful, and engaging, not to mention a lot of</why><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199636577000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CAPE Group July Meetup:  Beach Portraits!</name><id>7044672</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216588500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/7044672/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/a/0/global_3584464.jpeg</photo_url></item>
