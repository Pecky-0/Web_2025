For the first time buyers, there are some sweet deals!  Because of my new property (almost done and ready for the market!) that I am targeting to sell to a firsttimer, I have been digging in on what is available.  Good news for some areas, there are target HUD districts where no interest loans and/or grants can be available to fully or partially defray the 3.5% down payment and closing costs for an FHA loan.  Folks can get in for almost no down payment.  My property will be able to be owned for a little less than an average rent for a similar unit!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For investors, it is still pretty tight and requires a heavy % of cash in.  Money out refis are hard to come by, too.  For my property, there were REO restrictions that caused more obstacles and challenges.  It's a dance out there, but when we learn the basic steps, it can be done.  I will be sharing how it is working for me on this project.  (I went hard money) Also before and afters to share, and my marketing strategies.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate enough to go to the Brookview weekend featuring Robyn Thompson, and got some terrific tips and insights there to share with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's plan, too, to talk about the real estate market, the impact of the stimulus package, and what projects and plans you are into.  I am looking forward to a great conversation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm regards,&lt;br /&gt;Annie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come in and go down the stairs to our meeting room on the lower level.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241477619000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236042846000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club April Meetup</name><id>9865282</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239058800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/9865282/</event_url></item>
