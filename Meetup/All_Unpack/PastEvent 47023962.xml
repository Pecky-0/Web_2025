&lt;p&gt;SATURDAY DEPARTURE to NH &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 I am going to peg 9:00 AM for our departure time out of the Exit 67 I-84 commuter parking lot on Saturday. The next stop will be the Rest Area on the Mass-Pike after the Sturbridge Toll plaza heading East. I will peg the Rest Area Arrival time at 9:40 AM. Look for the Ron Paul Truck. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please let me know if you are planning on Ronvoying with our group on Saturday and where you will meet with the group. - Dave A. email me for my cell#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting at 8 am Saturday Jillian's is the HQ for the Ron Paul NH Revolution, this is a weekend to take the message to the masses and it all starts there. By day we'll walk, knock and wave for Paul and then return to Jillian's that night to watch the debate and unwind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I received some breaking information regarding a very large sign wave Saturday at 2:00 PM, if anyone has the details please post here as I could not find anything online about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Chris Lawless and Leah Wolesko of the Free State Project will then be handing out the marching orders to everyone who will disperse for the day in as many directions as possible --putting door hangers on doors, phone banking, putting up signs ---whatever it takes --most will have cars who traveled by car and those who can fit more in their cars will share etc. Everyone will meet back at Jillians at 7pm for the debate party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;The plan was to try and attend the debate in Manchester on Saturday but to my knowledge no meetup members were selected to receive tickets. While we still may have a presence at the debate of some sort, many will be attending the debate watching party (there is a meetup scheduled here: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/ct4paul/events/46108142/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/ct4paul/events/461081...&lt;/a&gt;) at &lt;span&gt;Jillian's Billiard Club.
