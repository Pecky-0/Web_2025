This seminar will focus on knowledge and techniques to enable cyclists to ride safely and confidently with car traffic on public roads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's seminar will be conducted by &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/members/3311363/"&gt;Ken O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;. When asked how long he's been riding, he says he never stopped from when he was a kid. Ken is a certified Effective Cycling instructor from the &lt;a href="http://www.bikeleague.org/"&gt;League of American Bicyclists&lt;/a&gt; (LAB), and brings to our Meetup much knowledge of bicycle safety issues along with a willingness to challenge our assumptions about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at Gorham Bike &amp;amp; Ski's &lt;b&gt;new downtown location&lt;/b&gt;, 693 Congress Street. They have plenty off off-street car parking, for those who are unable to ride your bikes here. Check out their new digs!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229818331000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226266905000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Traffic Safety Seminar</name><id>9127348</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229472000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/9127348/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/7/3/global_4031747.jpeg</photo_url></item>
