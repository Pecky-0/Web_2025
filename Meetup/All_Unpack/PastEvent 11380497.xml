It is the beginning of the school year and I have started a new job and my foster son is now living with me permanently...i have been very busy. I have a second now and it seems like a great time to have a meetup! Lets make it at the Seedling Cafe in Nashua. We had a really nice time the last time we were there and there have been quite a few new members that have joined and I would love to meet you all and get a chance to catch up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ruth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. I do not know if you all know that there is a fee for having this meetup group...I do not want to charge you all for belonging to this group, but if you feel like throwing me a couple bucks that would be nice, if not that is nice too. I am glad the group is still here and hopefully we can make it something more. I would love to hear new things that are going on or ideas that people have for this group!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>you know me!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365646527000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253045793000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Meetup</name><id>11380497</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254067200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/11380497/</event_url></item>
