We had it indoors in the temperature controlled room because of the rain.  They also offered us an outdoor play area at the kennel so hopefully next time we can take advantage of that.  If we do I will bring a small kiddie pool for the pups to cool off in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this was not strictly enforced at the June meetup but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donations will be accepted to help support this growing pug meetup!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 2674662</member_name><member_id>2674662</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1154365444000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1151172309000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Pug July Meetup</name><id>4994308</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1154192400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/4994308/</event_url></item>
