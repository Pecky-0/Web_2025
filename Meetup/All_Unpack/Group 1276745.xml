Feeling good is the point of being, afterall!Â  We'll do processes, exercises, and guided meditations to help you connect to your Source Energy and to feel good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to have a variety of options for you to choose from and participate in: looser meetings, focused workshops, more intensive focus groups, social events, meditation evenings, calls, and movie nights! Got an idea or request? Please let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to have a strong community, so we hope you'll participate regularly and stay in touch by participating in our community's message board discussions and receiving our e-mails (which will include our "Good Vibrations" tips and news). To be able to do so, go to your account, and under "Your Groups", each one has an "Edit email settings". Set your preferences there. Hope to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also go to our Files section (under "More" at top of page) and read more about the intentions of our group and the beliefs and principles it is based on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy to you!&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.69</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1220708328000</created><lat>42.3199996948</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>1322</id><urlkey>meditation</urlkey><name>Meditation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2756</id><urlkey>abrahamhicks</urlkey><name>Abraham Hicks</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>3336</id><urlkey>self-improvement</urlkey><name>Self-Improvement</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>3382</id><urlkey>lawofattraction</urlkey><name>Law of Attraction</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4417</id><urlkey>consciousness</urlkey><name>Consciousness</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>8649</id><urlkey>personalgrowth</urlkey><name>Personal Growth</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>8702</id><urlkey>lifetransform</urlkey><name>Life Transformation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10290</id><urlkey>spirituality</urlkey><name>Spirituality</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>16144</id><urlkey>self-empowerment-exploration</urlkey><name>Self Empowerment &amp; Exploration</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>21136</id><urlkey>spirituality-personal-growth-meditation</urlkey><name>Spirituality, Personal Growth, Meditation</name></topics_item></topics><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name><id>1276745</id><members>566</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>7915265</member_id><name>Ann Ide</name></organizer><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/1/4/600_5412564.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/1/4/highres_5412564.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>5412564</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/1/4/thumb_5412564.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Framingham</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/</link><lon>-71.4300003052</lon></item>
