<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm covering the March for Babies on Sunday the 19th of April for the March of Dimes. I'm looking for a second, third, or as many as we can to photograph the event. No, it is not a paid gig. March of Dimes is non-profit. But it is a good cause and fun to photograph. Maybe we could treat this like a click and shoot? The turn around time for the images is very quick though, so I will ask anyone who joins to send me your best stuff the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Check out last year's event...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worcester March for Babies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact me if you're interested:&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jeff&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240312466000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239805428000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come Photograph-March for Babies for the March of Dimes</name><id>10190234</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240138800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/10190234/</event_url></item>
