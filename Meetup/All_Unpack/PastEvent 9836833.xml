Kate Ramsdell has offered to host a trivia meetup in Salem, Ma.  O'Neils is the place and I believe trivia starts at around 8:00 but the food is pretty good so how about we meet at 7:00 for some food, drinks and conversation before the trivia begins! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's see if we can get a Trivia North group going! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Kate is hosting and she will be looking out for you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judie</member_name><member_id>5431837</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281130664000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235740558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia North</name><id>9836833</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236726000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/9836833/</event_url></item>
