I'll have a game prepared, and if there are enough people we can get a second game running for a little variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your lucky dice, a cool adventure, or your favorite snack or drink (although I'll provide some as well), or just your own bad self!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: you can mapquest or google 48 South Road, Bedford, but the easiest way to describe it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Rt. 4/225 into Bedford, where it is called The Great Road.  (It's okay...)  South Road intersects The Great Road at the town common, where there is a huge, white Unitarian Church. (How New England can you get?!)  Turn down South Road toward the church and park alongside the fence by the common.  Walk down South Road past Salon Giovanni (about one block); 48 South Road is two doors past the salon on the left.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll know me...I'll be the guy who answers the door.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212619046000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><why>It can be tough for those of us who dwell in the outer reaches of the 95/495 band...getting all the way in to Boston to game, especially on a weeknight!
