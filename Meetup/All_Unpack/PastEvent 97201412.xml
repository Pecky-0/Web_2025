<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;While the Blue Hills has their official First Day hikes--which I have enjoyed in the past--let us take this tradition to the Fells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not been to the Fells since the snowstorm so am unsure how much snow fell there. For this reason, I require the following equipment for the walk--we may not use it, but we need it for safety reasons. Should you not own the gear, please do not sign up for the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required gear: snowshoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional gear: microspikes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is very cold, ensure you dress properly, bring layers so that you can delayer once we are all warmed up and layer up again at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as it is cold, we will NOT be waiting in the parking lot for people who are running late. &lt;strong&gt;We will leave the lot at 9:03am sharp&lt;/strong&gt;--plan to arrive slightly before 9am to be ready to walk by 9am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a fast-paced walk/workout&lt;/strong&gt;. We want to get out heart rate going and keep it elevated for the entire approx. 2hour walk. The route will be determined based on our pace and trail conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a fast paced walk, I keep the group small. This meetup is also offered to the "Hike the Middlesex Fells-group."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
