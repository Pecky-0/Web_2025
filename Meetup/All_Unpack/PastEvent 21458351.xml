<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;If all goes according to plan, Kelby, Loki and I will finish our 48th peak- Cannon - on this date! &amp;nbsp;We started our 48 4,000 footers with Tom, Field and Willey on July 11th of 2010. &amp;nbsp;Almost exactly one year later (and without any of these mountains being done in winter) we are finishing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come celebrate with us as we reflect on all that we have learned and accomplished in the last year. &amp;nbsp;Most of that is because of what I have learned from YOU - my fellow hikers! :) &amp;nbsp;You have advised, encouraged, entertained and even sung along the way. &amp;nbsp;I've been continually impressed with the people I meet on Meetup hikes. &amp;nbsp;And if any of you do not feel like hiking that day, 
&lt;strong&gt;you can always take the tram to the top&lt;/strong&gt; and meet us there for the celebration! &amp;nbsp;Party to follow - I'm planning dinner at the Common Man in Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message has been brought to you by the letter C (for Cannon and the Common Man), the number 48 and the color White.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------------------------&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;We'll ascend to the summit of Cannon via Lonesome Lake to the Hi-Canon Trail and descend via the Lonesome Lake Trail.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for cool and potentially poor weather conditions. DO NOT WEAR COTTON OR DENIM. If you have questions about how to prepare or how to dress, ask them in advance. Lonesome Lake can be a wet trail - Come prepared to stay dry!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Answers to FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is NOT a traverse, so we will NOT need to carpool to another location.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;We will meet in the Lafayette Place Parking lot at near the trailhead for Lonesome Lake - this is on the SOUTHBOUND SIDE of I-93.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sunset will be at &amp;nbsp;about 8:25pm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upper portion hike is *EXPOSED*.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will pass near Lonesome Lake Hut on the descent but do not intend to stop unless absolutely necessary, This would add .3 miles to the descent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potable water will be available for refills at the Visitor's Center at the top of Cannon Mountain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will START AND FINISH TOGETHER. If you cannot hold your speed down to match that of the group (if necessary), this is not the hike for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not a speedy hiker, but I do keep a steady pace.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the conditions are prohibitive, I have no qualms about turning around. The mountain will be there another day. &amp;nbsp;I would like you to be around for another day too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My hikes area always dog friendly, but please know the limits and abilities of your dog &amp;amp; bring plenty of water. 
  &lt;strong&gt;The upper portion of the Hi-Cannon trail is known to be steep and involves a few ladders.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will watch the weather carefully and post weather updates during the week leading up to the hike. I rely on NOAA and MWObs for my forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will provide attendees with my cell phone number in advance of the hike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Most of the payoff comes in the form of great views &amp;amp; enjoying the outdoors, but since this is my 48th hike, I am not likely to reschedule due to weather unless it is for safety reasons. &amp;nbsp;Please plan accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;RSVP Questions are not optional - If you do not provide me with a phone number to try and contact you on the morning of the hike (if necessary), we will NOT wait for you at the trailhead.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
     &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Book time is about &amp;nbsp;5.9 miles, 5hrs, 55 &amp;nbsp;minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. Plan on it taking about this long &amp;amp; possibly a little more since we intend to spend some time at the summit and take the paths to the ledges for views. &amp;nbsp;My climbs have been averaging a little faster than book time these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
