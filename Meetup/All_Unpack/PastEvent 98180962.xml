The variety of terrains, grades, and scenery make the Reservation one of those unique destinations. Carved out of parts of Holyoke and Easthampton, cleared and well-marked trails loop, stretch, and criss-cross for a good 20 miles spread over 2082 acres along the Mount Tom Range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bray L&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/d/0/event_193451472.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;oop Trail is a relatively easy trail with only a few brisk but short ups and downs and some rough terrain and makes a fine introduction to Mount Tom. It is a fine place to set off with a walking stick, yak trax in the winter are always a good idea, or snowshoes, weather permitting, or just you and your dog and maybe a camera. It's not a long journey, a meandering couple of miles where nature's grace affirms beauty. Letâ€™s enjoy this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is a Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation spot, the rules are that dogs should be on leash. Enter from Route 5 in Holyoke on Reservation Road. Follow to end to the entrance. This time of year there should be no fee for entry. Park in the first large lot by the lake on your left.&lt;/p&gt;
