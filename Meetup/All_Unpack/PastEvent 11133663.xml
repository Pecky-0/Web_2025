<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi Folks, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned in my earlier email, this debate meeting on free will is in preparation for the next one coming up on confabulation theory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In this Sept.11 meeting, John C will lead the charge for the free-will-ers - of course with backup from anyone who  wants to weigh in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I might lead the counter-point (i.e., the anti-free-will-ers) but my guess is there will be so many anti-free-will-ers with their say to have that they won't need my voice in the mix. (Thus, I might just relax and watch the show)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the subsequent meeting (to be scheduled) John C and I will jointly present confabulation theory (an interesting computational model of cognition). Stay tuned for that one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully we can hold the Sept.11 meeting in our usual place:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conference room 5th floor, 53 Bay State Road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;Sean&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send out an email to attendees a few days before the meeting</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sean Lee</member_name><member_id>2978255</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1254466344000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>philosophy-185</urlname><id>331299</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy of Mind Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250547896000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Next meetup: You have no choice but to believe in free will</name><id>11133663</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252708200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/philosophy-185/events/11133663/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/4/global_678996.jpeg</photo_url></item>
