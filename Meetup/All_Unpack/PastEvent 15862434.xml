So, for the first Meetup of the new year, I thought we'd start by going back to the basics. Burt Beckwith will be presenting &amp;quot;Twitter in 40 Minutes &amp;quot;,  a talk designed to introduce people to the power of Grails. Here's the description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This talk will demonstrate how the basics of Twitter could have been built using Grails and JMS in a mere 40 minutes. A fast paced and code-driven presentation, we will build a Twitter-like application from scratch using Grails and its rapid application development capability. By bringing together Spring, JMS and Java persistence techniques we will also see advanced tips and techniques for constructing Grails applications that can be deployed on to the Java EE platform.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with little to no Grails experience (or for those of you who just want to hear a good presentation), I encourage you to attend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Top of the stairs, on the right</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Pember</member_name><member_id>9587085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299026970000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Grails-Boston</urlname><id>1458975</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Boston Grails Users' Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293746706000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Twitter in 40 Minutes</name><id>15862434</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295481600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Grails-Boston/events/15862434/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/global_9810037.jpeg</photo_url></item>
