Fools stand on their island of opportunities and look toward another land. There is no other land; there is no other life but this.&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;-Henry David Thoreau &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be sure to RSVP! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I would love to be the poet laureate of Coney Island.&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;-Thornton Wilder, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, I would love to be an Oscar Myer wiener? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Island, Virgin Islands, New Zealand, any island's food! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one new thing is that this time you need to &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; your island when you RSVP and an island can only be called once! So RSVP soon and be sure to note from which island your recipe will be originating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Island, Rhode Island, Prince Edward Island, Abd Al Kuri, Bali ? need more island ideas?? Go to &lt;a href="http://islands.unep.ch/Iindex.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://islands.unep.c...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now everyone should know the routine. Plan to cook onsite unless your recipe takes longer than an hour to prepare. If the recipe calls for unusual equipment bring it with you. Any doubts just email me. Remember someone will ask you how your dish fits the theme so have your answers ready!  Be prepared to share your recipe. Plan on making a dish to share that fits the theme.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are vege or have allergies fill out the profile questions and let us know.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It helps if people bring what they want to drink and are willing to share.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All adult folk are welcome.
