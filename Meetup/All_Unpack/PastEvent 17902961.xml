How do we balance the allure of money, fame and social status with our needs for good relationships, health and a sense of contentment? Through powerful interviews and a global journey the film seeks to share the wisdom found in traditional cultures and from the cutting edge science that is now, for the first time, exploring human happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to hearing from leading neuroscientists and psychologists in the field, HAPPY explores personal stories from around the world. Can Manoj Singh, a rickshaw puller from the slums of Kolkata, India, who lives in a hut made of plastic bags with his family be just as happy as the average American? In fact, he is. What about Melissa Moody, the beautiful debutant mother of three who had a “perfect life” until the day she was run over by a truck? Disabled for 9 years and disfigured for life, amazingly she is happier now than before her accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306594722000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Documentary on what makes us happy ;-)
