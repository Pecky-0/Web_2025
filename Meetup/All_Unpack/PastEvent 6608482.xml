What a great group of dogs that came out to play &amp;amp; we had great weather again!  Our November meetup is scheduled for the 17th, from 1-2pm at Best Friends Pet Care in Boxford (right off of I-95).  Don't worry if the weather isn't great - there's a large indoor play room to use for the meetup.  Hopefully everyone can make it &amp;amp; we'll see you then!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542451000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193231688000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November Meetup!</name><id>6608482</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195322400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/6608482/</event_url></item>
