<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Someone threw down a guantlet recently, boasting about their Air Hockey skills and making broad claims that they were the best of the best....  Had obviously not taken into account my competitive nature and complete inability to ignore a challenge!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought, a little air hockey tournament would be just the thing to sort them out!  So I found a place in Somerville that has a handful of tables and invite you all to come along and try your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And watch me loose interest very quickly as soon as it becomes evident I am not going to win!  Oh well, I reserve the right to pretend that I am throwing the game so someone else can win... organisers perogative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If I find another place more central than Somerville I may change the location, but I wanted to get the date in peoples diaries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;H.&lt;br /&gt;hathompson@statestreet.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1148407422000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1147379903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hand to Eye Coordination Testing Date</name><id>4932759</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1148234400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/4932759/</event_url></item>
