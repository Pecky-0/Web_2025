It's already hit other parts of the country like LA and NYC. So we're just going to help it along here. It's about time!! In New York everyone wears cool and stylish hats out. LA, too! But not so much here unless it's a Redsox, Patriots or the occasional Yankees cap. So... let's start a revolution here by putting on your best hat and joining me out at 29 Newbury for the 29 Newbury Art Gallery. Then from there we'll just head to 29 Newbury the Restaurant for an early dinner or light fare and then off to CLINK at the Liberty Hotel for a drink. Or if you want you can just join me at CLINK. It's up to you!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE HAT REVOLUTION FULL SCHEDULE:&lt;br /&gt;5:00PM @ 29 Newbury Art Gallery --For The Art&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00PM @ 29 Newbury Restaurant --For Dinner or Light Fare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:00PM @ CLINK @ The Liberty Hotel --For Drinks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's All About The Hat:&lt;br /&gt;The classic flat cap, was first popular with 19th-century longshoremen and now with 21st-century celebrities, should be known these days simply as the Brad Pitt. However, over the years it has been called everything from the newsboy, the Jay Gatsby, the Big Apple, the Ivy, the eight-panel, even the Lundberg Stetson. And today the Brad Pitt. Above, however, Johnny Depp knows how to wear a fedora another classic. Also, you can checkout more cool pics/hats and style @ Going.com/hatrevolution.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent and humorous occurrence happened to me while a few of us were visiting Manhattan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman in Prohibition (a lounge on the Upper West Side) asked, &amp;quot;Why are there so many people wearing hats here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Ha!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman in Prohibition: &amp;quot;No, really, why are so many people wearing hats?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Well, you know.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman in Prohibition: &amp;quot;No, why?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Well it's Manhattan. Everyone wears hats here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman in Prohibition: &amp;quot;That's right, it's Man Hattan!!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Ha!... Ha!...&amp;quot; (I felt like a fool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman smiled and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Man Hattan&amp;quot; A new play coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's All About The Hat (continued): &lt;br /&gt;The elegantly casual newsboy is the cap most embraced by celebrities, regularly worn by luminaries like Robert Redford and other Hollywood hotshots including Brad Pitt, Terrence Howard, and Ashton Kutcher. Even George Clooney and Will Smith have had the good taste to wear newsboys on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a new hat? Have fun! Challenge yourself.  Be brave! Be Bold! Make a statement!

Our goal, by the end of the night, is to have at least one stranger ask, &amp;quot;why are so many people wearing such cool hats here?&amp;quot; :) It will be the coolest thing, 20-30 people all wearing cool/stylish hats out in the city. It will be just like hanging out in the East Village all over again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only question that remains is... what hat will you chose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, A Revolution of Sorts - A Hat Revolution (Part 2) is already on the docket for December.
