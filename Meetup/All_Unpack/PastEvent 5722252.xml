Its a gorgeous trail that is completly off road and flat as can be!  It is about 45-50 minutes away but well worth the drive!&lt;br /&gt;  We can meet up at my place as its on the way, or if you chose to meet us there,we will be at the parking lot on Mechanic Street in Amenia New York.&lt;br /&gt;  I will email directions to anyone interested in caravaning from my place.&lt;br /&gt;    This event will begin at 11:00 at the bike trail in amenia. Please be at my place by 10:00 for the drive up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178550534000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177874173000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harlem Valley Bike Ride with AnnMarie</name><id>5722252</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178377200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5722252/</event_url></item>
