Shame on me, but I'm making up for it by 1) scheduling the meet-up for closer to mid-October than early October and 2) selecting a book that's just 240 pages, so everyone should have time to read it at their leisure.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the next few days I'll also get up a new book poll so that we can choose November's read, and there will be a new question option: restaurant suggestions for where to meet.  I'll figure somewhere out for October (guaranteed to be in Cambridge and within walking distance of the T), but if anyone can think of a venue that works well logistically for seating 15 or so people in a way that they can all hear each other, then shoot that info my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our October book is The Convalescent by Jessica Anthony.  It's about a non-verbal, Hungarian dwarf who sells meat out of a bus in Virginia.  Give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Convalescent-Jessica-Anthony/dp/0802144950/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1284205905&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780802144959-0" target="_blank"&gt;Powell's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://store.mcsweeneys.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.detail/object_id/6e7bec9b-fb89-46d6-bfdf-923bcb69d1d6/TheConvalescent.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;McSweeney's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I keep forgetting to add this to the postings, but if this is your first meeting, please bring $1 with which to buy yourself a lifetime of book-clubbing and to somewhat offset the cost of using MeetUp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick</member_name><member_id>10094294</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287189435000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284207407000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Readers: The Convalescent by Jessica Anthony</name><id>14732386</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287010800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/14732386/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/c/global_17855164.jpeg</photo_url></item>
