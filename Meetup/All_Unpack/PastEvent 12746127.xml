The arid City of Wonders is under siege by adversaries from a dozen different points in time, and nobody knows where they're coming from, though they seem bent on destroying the city! Players will use safe foam weapons as they create and play the roles of fantasy heroes. Battle soldiers and monsters out of mythology, find legendary treasure, and solve mysteries and puzzles in this week long fantasy adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$295 for members, $345 for non-members. Call 781-270-4800 for more info!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269520524000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267471681000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March School Break Adventure - Sands of Time</name><id>12746127</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269347400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/12746127/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/e/global_6162670.jpeg</photo_url></item>
