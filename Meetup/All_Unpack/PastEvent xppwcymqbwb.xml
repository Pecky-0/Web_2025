Here are the details of the December meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonightâ€™s topic: Setting your Top Goals for 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note that this is actually a two-part topic: we'll start it in December, and finish it up at our January meeting.  While it will still be valuable if you can only make it to one or the other, you'll get the most out of it if you come to both.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To finish with 2009 and kick off 2010, we're going to utilize a series of NLP techniques that have to do with successful goal-setting (note that we did a similar set of processes last January, with great results):&lt;br /&gt;- We'll start with a guided Trans-Derivational search (review) of 2009, gathering up lessons learned in the past year.&lt;br /&gt;- We'll use those learnings to create higher intentions for 2010&lt;br /&gt;- From those higher intentions, we'll generate Well-Formed Outcomes (can't-miss goals) for 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's probably where we'll stop for this month's meetup.  For the January meetup, we'll continue with the following steps:&lt;br /&gt;- We'll &amp;quot;Walk our Timelines&amp;quot; for 2010 to see more clearly how our well-formed outcomes come into reality in the coming year.&lt;br /&gt;- Finally, we'll use Circles of Excellence to give ourselves access to the internal resources that will be most useful to us in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great opportunity to learn (or review) a highly useful set of NLP techniques, while accomplishing some important planning for yourself for the coming year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to discuss specific issues that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Marx&lt;br /&gt;NLP Master Practitioner&lt;br /&gt;New Light NLP&lt;br /&gt;317 N Main St, Natick MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;(617) 329-1657&lt;br /&gt;adam@NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;www.NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;Helping you to become the you that you want to be:&lt;br /&gt;Coaching, Counseling, and Training&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go straight back to the large studio</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261268408000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258680178000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston NLP December Meetup - Setting your Goals for 2010 - Part 1</name><id>xppwcymqbwb</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261095300000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/11916103/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/8/global_6860792.jpeg</photo_url></item>
