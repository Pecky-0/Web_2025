The exact location to meet is N 42°20.683'; W 71°15.582'  :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 10.45 am at the Newton Boat house, do the paper work for rentals and be on the water by 11.00am. This is also a scenic stretch of flat water with lots of wildlife along the river, you may bring your camera, but keep it safe from water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is rental charge for the kayaks/canoes. We will plan to do about 2 hours, so if renting solo, it would be around $30.00pp, dual/shared ones would be 18.00pp (prices are approximate ballpark, pl check at store). Do bring your license/ID, bottle(s) of water. After the trip, we can stop at newton for sandwich/lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a parking lot little further from the boathouse, it is little tricky to find out, you may stop at the boathouse to get directions.&lt;a href="http://www.paddleboston.com/newton.php" target="_blank"&gt;Rental/boathouse&lt;/a&gt;[/url]&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will meet at the paddle store.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>ganga</member_name><member_id>2130792</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1272379836000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270852619000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayaking/Canoeing in Charles River @ Newton</name><id>13138558</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272206700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/13138558/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/5/global_14238565.jpeg</photo_url></item>
