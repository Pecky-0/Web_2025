We should be done at around 8pm.&lt;/b&gt;. The debate starts at 9pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join the Sierra Club at our annual &lt;b&gt;Political Gossip Night&lt;/b&gt; to discuss what's going on locally and nationally! We'll have some information about some of the campaigns and candidates, and lots of opportunities to get involved with local, regional, and national campaigns. There will also be folks from NH explaining how to get involved in one of the most important swing states in the USA. &lt;i&gt;Everyone is welcome - bring your friends! This is a free event.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The Luna Cafe serves coffee, tea, gelati, as well as wine, beer, delicious soups, sandwiches, and pastries. They're just a few blocks from the Central Square stop on the Red Line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also a public parking lot behind the cafe.
