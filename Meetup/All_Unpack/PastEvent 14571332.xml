<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is planned to be a 1- 1.25 hour hike through the wooded areas of Mansfield Hollow State Park along the water's edge. Trails are mostly flat, and are even old pavement in some places. I'll be bringing a pair of fox terriers for their playtime: other offleash, friendly dogs are also welcome, just let me know in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the weather will cooperate!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Field Trial Area parking lot, which is located at the end of N. Windham Rd, right where it dead-ends. Please try to be punctual if you RSVP yes, since we will have limited daylight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about the location, feel free to give me a call on 860-634-6541 (cell).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the parking lot with a black SUV and two fox terriers</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Northrop</member_name><member_id>8657197</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283568935000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283006831000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Late Afternoon Hiking in Mansfield Hollow</name><id>14571332</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283375700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/14571332/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_6487468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
