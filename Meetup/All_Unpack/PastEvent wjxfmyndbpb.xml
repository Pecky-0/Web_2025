<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join us for a discussion of Chapter One of &amp;quot;The Artist's Way.&amp;quot; We'll introduce ourselves, review our working guidelines, then hold chapter discussions. We have enough interest in the book &amp;quot;Finding Water&amp;quot; that, during chapter discussions, one group can discuss Chapter 1 of that book. After an hour, we'll open up to general conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Thusday ONLY we will be meeting in ** The Rotary Conference Room ** at the Central Square Branch of the Cambridge Public Library, 45 Pearl St., Cambridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Central Square Branch is easily accessible, even under inches of snow. It is two blocks from the Red Line stop at Central Square (Mass Ave between Essex and Prospect), and on the same block with the inexpensive, covered Green St. Garage (260 Green St., more info in comments below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need a library card to get in to the Library. Enter from Pearl St. or from Franklin St., find the staircase (not far from Circulation), go downstairs, take a left, walk down the hall and the conference room will be on your right. We are welcome to have beverages and snacks in the room, though not to carry them elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn't fit in a solo artist date this week? Conveniently located within a block of the library are A+C Artist and Craftsman supply at 580 Mass Ave (open till 7pm), the relaxing Rangzen Restaurant (24 Pearl St.), and Clear Conscience Cafe at 581 Mass Ave. Just a few blocks further are Rodney's used bookstore (698 Mass Ave) Ten Thousand Villages (694 Mass Ave), plus several music and movie stores. Take the opportunity to load up on images, ideas, and inspiration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** We will be reviewing our Working Guidelines and Basic Tools at the top of the meeting, which relate to respectful listening. ****&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brooke</member_name><member_id>8390120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266536375000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Artists and Creators!</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Artists-Way-Boston-area</urlname><id>1471304</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Artists Way Boston Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262912585000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Artists Way Cambridge Meetup</name><id>wjxfmyndbpb</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265932800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Artists-Way-Boston-area/events/12256260/</event_url></item>
