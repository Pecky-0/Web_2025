&lt;p&gt;Our SOS FUN Mission is to hit Vernon Street Studio on this second day of fun and art with over 50 studios and take is from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in an historic 19th century brick industrial building, Vernon Street housed the first group of artists to open their studios to the public in 1975. The Open Studios event allows attendees to learn about the creative process, interact with artists in the spaces where they create, purchase original artwork, and discover new talent. The studios are located in the Rogers Foam facility, which is comprised of two buildings on the corner of Central and Vernon Streets. Parking is available in the large lot behind the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerville Open Studios (SOS): Visit Somerville's Diverse + Vibrant Arts Community. Over 300 artists in over 100 venues will open their homes and studios for the 13th Annual SomervilleÂ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this free showcase for the arts, mid-career and emerging artists working across a broad spectrum of fine art styles and craft media including painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, glass, fiber, jewelry, furniture and ceramics will exhibit their work to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to SOS will be treated to displays of art in both traditional and non-traditional spaces throughout the city.
