Pub trivia is a fun social event. I will arrive at about 7:00.  Trivia starts at 8 p.m. However trivia is usually on the ground level on Thursday which gets crowded early.  Please try to arrive by 7:30 to eat, drink &amp;amp; socialize.  If you find you will not be able to go, please change your RSVP so we are not holding chairs from other teams and then not using them. Thank you for being considerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will compete with other teams at the bar for prizes and bragging rights. Tommy Doyle's has a good pub dinner menu and an excellent beer selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying you aren't any good at trivia is no excuse not to come join us. Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography? Everyone knows something about the world and can make a great contribution to the game as well as to the conversations while we play. Come on out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring cash for what you eat and drink. It makes splitting the bill much easier.  Since trivia is free and the bar and wait staff make money off our purchases, please try to order at least $5.00 of food/drink.  If you can not do this a dollar or two for the wait staff is in order.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet inside.
