The wide and well groomed trails cover 134.5 acres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trails pass through woodlands that contain a variety of forest flora including white pines, red oak, maple, beeches, and mature hemlocks, vernal pools and other wetland areas.  In the woods, meadows, and estate grounds, there are wild flowers in season, a variety of native shrubs and plants, and estate plantings such as mountain laurel, azalea, rhododendrons, and wisteria. The Western Greenway Trail traverses the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
