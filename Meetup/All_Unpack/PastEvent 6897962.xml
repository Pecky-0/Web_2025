The Park Street T-stop (Green/Red Line) is a very central location. Bring any signs and literature you have. While the focus is handing out the Tea Party Rally invites, having some lit with information about Ron Paul as well for those who are curious would be wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or can't find the group, call Michael Casey at 1-617-510-2487. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you come to the event empty handed, ask Michael to give you some leftover flyers to post on community bulliten boards, at colleges, etc. Spread the word!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542752000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197428087000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tea Party Rally invite handouts / sign wave</name><id>6897962</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197495000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/6897962/</event_url></item>
