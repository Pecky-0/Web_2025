&lt;p&gt;Greg, our bartender du noir, has assured me that he will put the audio on for us.  Durty Nelly's has three tvs.  Food will be available -- burgers, hot dogs, and other fried fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE PAY AS YOU GO OR MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB.  Note that while I don't expect a large crowd, Durty Nelly's may get crowded so be prepared to stand. I should be there about 6:30pm or sooner. Tip-off is at 7:00pm.  (NOTE: Lakers/Thunder play right after C's game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GO CELTICS!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture, or just ask the bartender who I am.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabel Bourelle</member_name><member_id>8394555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337653498000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337606549000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>*LAST MINUTE MEETUP* Celtics v. 76ers Game 5 TONIGHT</name><id>65675912</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337641200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/65675912/</event_url></item>
