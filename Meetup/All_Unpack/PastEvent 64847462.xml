&lt;p&gt;ABOUT OUR PRESENTERS &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Jess Faulk&lt;/strong&gt; has been talking tech for over 20 years. Her very first computer (not counting her Atari) was a hand-me-down black and white Macintosh Classic. However, it was her Macintosh Performa that really made her fall in love with all of the possibilities that computers and the budding internet could bring into our lives. Since then she has developed an intense curiosity for new technology and how to make it useful in our day to day lives. Jess also has a strong interest in design, and tries to find ways to wed her love for graphics and tech (especially in designing infographics). Read Jess' blog at &lt;a href="http://www.jessfaulk.com"&gt;www.jessfaulk.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Robbie Samuels&lt;/strong&gt; is often asked how he manages to do so much and still sleep. These tips are the answer. His non-stop schedule includes running 2 events a month for Socializing for Justice, 23 events a year for Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp;amp; Defenders and 1-4 trainings a month "on the side". No wonder Boston City Council named his birthday "Robbie Samuels Day" in 2011! His very first computer was a Commodore 64 when he was in 3rd grade and he was hooked. Some thought he'd "go into computers", but instead he uses technology to enhance his life, increase his productivity and engage with his community. Learn more about his trainings, including: Art of the Schmooze, Fundraising: Getting Past the Fear of Asking, Suicide Prevention Training for Community Leaders, at &lt;a href="http://www.robbiesamuels.com/"&gt;www.robbiesamuels.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 2000 members and 5 1/2 years of creating a diverse cross-issue community in Boston (125+ events!), Socializing for Justice is the best place to find the great people, organizations and community you're looking for while putting the SOCIAL back in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/strong&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
