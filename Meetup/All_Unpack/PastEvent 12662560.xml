For those of you who have said, &amp;quot;7:00 a.m. is just to darn early.&amp;quot; We have heard ya!!!  We will be meeting a 9:00 a.m. in parking lot 1.  This is the first lot on the left after the ranger gate as you drive into the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge.  Do not show up unless you have a big ass smile on your face and are ready to laugh and have a blast!  There is a $5.00 entrance fee to get into the park, parking is free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will car spot early in the morning for those who do not want to walk the entire beach.  There will be many options for those who only want to walk a small distance.  If you go the distance the round trip is 14 miles. This is a very easy hike/walk as we never leave the beach. Bring a bag for beach finds and something to eat and drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Plum Island--- an 11-mile long barrier Island off the shore of Newburyport and Newbury Massachusetts.
