Eighty percent of the trail features great views, on rock ledges,  a rarity in the wooded Northeast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will test the trail on the easier Mt Welch for traction before continuing on to Dickey. Expect the rock slabs to be slippery or snow covered. traction is mandatory.  We want to safely hike the many open slab crossings found on the Mt. Welch &amp;amp; Mt. Dickey Loop. It is here that we decide to continue or turn around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summer its one of those modest effort-great reward hikes. In the winter, traction is mandatory: microspikes to full crampons. MSR snowshoes have better traction than Tubbs. pack for a variety of conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winter Route Level rating: Moderate - Advanced&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail: Option 1&lt;/b&gt;  We will make the loop counter-clockwise to allow for an easier return trip. From the trail head parking on Orris Road, we will follow the trail to the right, toward Welch Mountain. We will start heading uphill after about half a mile, then traverse flat, open ledges, amidst scrubby jack pine and dwarf birch, to reach the summit of Welch and views of Mad River and Campton Meadows. Note: a few rock scrambles will be encountered on this section. We will then drop back into the woods before continuing up and over more exposed ledge to the summit of Dickeys summit. After a great ridge walk, with one stunningly sheer drop-off, we will descend to a logging road for the final hike out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time/Distance: &lt;br /&gt;4.5-mile loop, We will take our time to enjoy the views, eat, take pictures and just have fun (Probably 4.5 to 5 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gear: full winter gear, extra gloves, crampons&lt;br /&gt;Weather Note: Extreme temperatures/winds or official weather warnings will cancel this hike.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer &lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the Disclaimer and things you must know&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Gold Honda CRV or grey mazda van.  phone 603-477-5116  in parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234989420000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233450676000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Welch-Dickey Loop Winter Hike</name><id>9643279</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234706400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9643279/</event_url></item>
