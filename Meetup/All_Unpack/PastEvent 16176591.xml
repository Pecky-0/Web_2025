Also, Feb 18 is Reds Winter Hat night - First 3000 fans in the door get a free RI Reds winter hat.  So we'll try to meet early and let folks get to the arena early.  We'll likely meet at Murphy's (100 Fountain St) as early as I can get back from Boston, and we'll probably head back to Murphy's after the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need 10+ people to get the group rate.  Last year we had near 20.  Lets see if we can get a group of 30 this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go, get me $14 by 2/14.  The tickets are lower level seats and these seats normally go for $28.  I'll be at the Monday meetups for those that want to pay in cash.  If you prefer to use pay-pal or amazon payments, I can do that, but it'll be $15 (for the service charges.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, if you rsvp for this meetup - I'm not going to hound you for money.  If you don't get me (John) the money or make arrangements to pay by 2/12 please don't come ask for a ticket on 2/18, as we won't be buying extras.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing my Virginia Tech scarf - Orange and Maroon stripes.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8642703</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298304610000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295939378000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence Bruins vs Portland Pirates</name><id>16176591</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298073600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/16176591/</event_url></item>
