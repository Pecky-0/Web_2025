This secular organization is based on preserving Judaism?s highest ethical traditions and reverence for the value of each person, and since its formation in 1969 has grown to some 10,000 members in 30 congregations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherwin Wine was a featured speaker at the New Humanism conference at Harvard&lt;br /&gt;University in April, and also at the recent UUA General Assembly, where his talk ?A&lt;br /&gt;Jewish Perspective on the Future of Humanism? was co-sponsored by UUs for Jewish&lt;br /&gt;Awareness and the HUUmanists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start with coffee and conversation at 7:30 PM.  The main program will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It is not necessary to RSVP for this event; I'm listing it as a meetup so that you can get e-mail reminders from meetup.com)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192664172000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191431047000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Remembering Rabbi Sherwin Wine (1928-2007)</name><id>6479696</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192491000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/6479696/</event_url></item>
