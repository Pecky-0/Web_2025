Some carefully sculpted trees, spaced apart, bordering an enormous lake. There are people (but not a lot) and an enormous gazebo. Very convenient to get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO MEET*: At the posted time, with 1/2 hour leeway for late-comers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Route 128 to exits for Wakefield. There are 2 exits and both will lead you towards the site. Head towards Wakefield center. Immediately outside of the center is a common that you can't miss. (why do Commons always have cannons?). Across the street from that common is another grassy area with the lake. On that second grassy area you'll see the gazebo. Park anywhere and we'll paint within view of that gazebo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER:&lt;br /&gt;            RSVPs: It's best to let us know you are coming so we can look for you or alert you to any changes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO BRING WHICH ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN: &lt;br /&gt;                        Mosquito repellant,  Paper towels,  Sweater, water, food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            *LAX: We meet at the time above. You have 30 minutes additional slack, after which we may leave to the painting site without you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            INCLEMENT WEATHER: It is up to you to determine if the weather makes painting untenable. Although, I will try to leave a message on my voice mail if I myself do not intend to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213121524000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212617402000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PLEIN AIR OUTING: Lake Quannapowitt, Wakefield</name><id>8079886</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212948000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/8079886/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/c/global_1743932.jpeg</photo_url></item>
