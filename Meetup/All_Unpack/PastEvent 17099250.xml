Ben is looking for someone to hike with him on Sunday April 3 at 8:30 AM. He is thinking of doing either the Osceolas or Whiteface &amp;amp; Passaconaway. Here is what he wrote:  "I'm working on skiing the 48 in NH, and these ones are going to melt fast. This is a project to help raise awareness for charity (YES Kids), and the more I get done, the more awareness is raised."  Please contact Ben if you have any questions or would like to join him this weekend.
