<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This Valentine's Day hike has a tragic star-crossed love centered theme. Hear how the Indian Princess Lillinonah, her hand sought by many a man for miles around, met her love in the early 1700's and how she met her untimely death in the area of this hike because of her deep love. We can contemplate love, true love, and those people and circumstances that work against the same. We will be hiking the hillside and cliffs on either side of the Housatonic River at the north end of Lake Lillinonah. We will even hike in the area Lillinonah and her lover may be buried per the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike will be an easier hike of about 3.65 miles though we may have steep sections to hike up/down for short distances and we will have snow and possibly some ice to deal with. We will have clifftop views of Lake Lillinonah from Lovers Leap and we will cross over the Housatonic river on an abandoned iron bridge built in 1895.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will be divided into three sections. The first loop of about .8 mile we will explore the ruins of the Silex Factory on the Old Factory Trail. The next loop of 1.25 miles on the Waramaug Loop will explore the Indian Spring House ruins as well as get us lakeside views. The third looping/out-and-back hike of about 1.6 miles will take us over the river, to the Lovers Leap cliffs (I'll read the story of Lillinonah here), to ruins of the Tea House, then to the &amp;quot;Castle&amp;quot; ruins, then up to a lookout (in area where Lillanonah and her lover may be buried) and then back to the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Those who wish to go MUST have:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;* Backpack - To carry extra layers of clothing, trail food, water, gear  &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed warm hiking boots or comfortable winter boots (no sneakers!) - There could be ice/snow or it could be wet/muddy!  &lt;br /&gt;* &lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;MICROspikes&lt;/span&gt; (or other traction device) -MUST have! There could be ice! &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks - To keep those feet warm even if wet.  &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing - Avoid cotton as it stays wet/cold. Don't forget your legs can get cold too.  &lt;br /&gt;* Gloves  &lt;br /&gt;* Jacket &lt;br /&gt;* Warm hat  &lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advised/optional equipment depending on conditions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Hiking poles (or snowshoe poles)&lt;br /&gt;* Gators or snowpants - To keep snow out of boots&lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate food - (e.g. at least G.O.R.P -Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, beef jerky, granola bars, etc.)  &lt;br /&gt;* Fanny sled - OK, we might have opportunity to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jacket shouldn't be too heavy as other layers of clothing should add to your insulation to keep warm and layers would be added or removed as needed. While hiking you WILL be hot but if you stop you WILL get very cold after about 15 minutes and thus need more dry layers added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 2 PM at the parking area of the State park (see location/directions below). We will hike (with rest stops and sightseeing) about 3 hr. and get back at about 5 PM to the cars. Then the plan is to head out to eat somewhere if people are interested, otherwise head home.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail map:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/stateparks/maps/loversleap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lovers Leap State Park - more information:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&amp;amp;q=433316&amp;amp;depNav_GID=1650" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Lillinonah's Leap - the story:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.curbstone.org/index.cfm?webpage=119" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.curbstone....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate location/directions to meet at Meetup location&lt;/b&gt; (around 40 Pumpkin Hill Rd., New Milford, CT): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=New+Milford&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=40+Pumpkin+Hill+Rd&amp;amp;zipcode=06776-4625&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.542727&amp;amp;longitude=-73.409438&amp;amp;geocode=ADDRESS" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(approx.
