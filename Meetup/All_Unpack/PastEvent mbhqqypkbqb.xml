Book Club meeting is 
&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Cutting For Stone&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; by Abraham Verghese.&amp;nbsp; Here is a brief synopsis of 
&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Cutting For Stone&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; from Barnes and Noble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Marion and Shiva Stone are twin brothers born of a
    secret union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British
    surgeon. Orphaned by their mother&amp;rsquo;s death and their
    father&amp;rsquo;s disappearance, bound together by a preternatural
    connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins
    come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of
    revolution.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Moving from Addis Ababa to New York City and back
    again, Cutting for Stone is an unforgettable story of love and
    betrayal, medicine and ordinary miracles&amp;mdash;and two brothers
    whose fates are forever intertwined.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;And from Publishers Weekly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Starred Review. Lauded for his sensitive memoir (My Own
    Country) about his time as a doctor in eastern Tennessee at the
    onset of the AIDS epidemic in the 80s, Verghese turns his
    formidable talents to fiction, mining his own life and
    experiences in a magnificent, sweeping novel that moves from
    India to Ethiopia to an inner-city hospital in New York City
    over decades and generations. Sister Mary Joseph Praise, a
    devout young nun, leaves the south Indian state of Kerala in
    1947 for a missionary post in Yemen. During the arduous sea
    voyage, she saves the life of an English doctor bound for
    Ethiopia, Thomas Stone, who becomes a key player in her destiny
    when they meet up again at Missing Hospital in Addis Ababa.
    Seven years later, Sister Praise dies birthing twin boys: Shiva
    and Marion, the latter narrating his own and his brothers long,
    dramatic, biblical story set against the backdrop of political
    turmoil in Ethiopia, the life of the hospital compound in which
    they grow up and the love story of their adopted parents, both
    doctors at Missing. The boys become doctors as well and
    Vergheses weaving of the practice of medicine into the
    narrative is fascinating even as the story bobs and weaves with
    the power and coincidences of the best 19th-century
    novel.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
