One of our members was gracious enough to open their Kingston home for an end of the summer Pot luck BBQ.  (address to follow)  We'll also plan to play some activities maybe Volley Ball or something.  Her home is just a quick 10 minutes off the Route 3 South Highway and all are welcome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everyone's busy lives we find that we only get to know those specific to our meetup interest.  This will be a great way to meet others in the group and hear what activities they take part in and get to know more of the group as a whole as us organizers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a BONUS ....  guess who's birthday it is - Julie's.  For those of you who don't know, Julie is the group organizer.  So you have to come and share cake for her birthday with us &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - Remember to bring:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mention in your RSVP what you will be bringing for food&lt;br /&gt;a lawn chair&lt;br /&gt;sunscreen/bug spray&lt;br /&gt;a sweatshirt in case it get's cooler&lt;br /&gt;beer/wine/soda etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>8338847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285615043000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282341770000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>END OF SUMMER BBQ!!!</name><id>14488622</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284231600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/14488622/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/4/global_17172772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
