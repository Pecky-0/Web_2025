On Saturday, August 4th, we will all convene at Hampton Beach to Paint the SKY Ron! Let's have some fun! All you have to do between now and then is to come up with a clever way to get Ron Paul's name high above the sunbathing masses. I suggest kites, but you might consider some sort of helium balloons with Ron Paul signs attached or suspended. Hint: if you don't want to make a kite, you could paint your &amp;quot;Ron Paul&amp;quot; message on a ready made kite. Bigger is better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to bring lots of literature. There will be plenty of curious voters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will only be successful with LOTS of enthusiastic participation. Can you just picture 100 or more of us doing this? Invite friends and family to make or paint their own kites and join us. This is going to make a GREAT You Tube Video! Don't be left out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP and get on board for a fun day at the beach! Rain Date will be Sunday, August 5th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's launch this campaign into the stratosphere!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186409051000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185029348000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paint the Sky Ron</name><id>6056385</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186236000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6056385/</event_url></item>
