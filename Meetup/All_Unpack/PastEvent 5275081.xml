But Japanese food is a lot more than raw fish, and Ginza offers plenty for the seafood-averse. There's tempura, sukiyaki, bento box lunches, udon and soba noodle dishes, steak, yakitori and seafood specials. But Ginza takes special pride in its hibachi offerings, with three new hoodless and smokeless grills. With flashes of flame, twirling knives, and an acrobatic flair with ingredients, the hibachi chefs turn cooking into a live-action spectator sport. General Manager Alexander DePratti says Ginza aims to offer both a high-end, fine-dining experience and a welcoming family-friendly environment. &amp;quot;That's what makes our restaurant great. We can please the couple coming in from New York or San Francisco as well as accommodating the family of five.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginza takes home three first-place awards again this year, also winning in the Best Japanese and Best Service categories. General Manager Alexander DePratti has a hunch about why Ginza won Best Sushi. &amp;quot;We just got a new head sushi chef, Yoshi, out of New York. He's unbelievable. He's killing it. He's always got great specials.&amp;quot; And what's new with sushi fanatics? &amp;quot;It's not really about the special rolls any more. It's about the sauces, the special fish, fatty fish.&amp;quot; Avid customers seem to be showing a keen interest in tartars, says DePratti. And look for Feng, a new restaurant by the folks at Ginza scheduled to open downtown soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also won:  1st place, Best Sushi&lt;br /&gt;1st place, Best Service In A Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;3rd place, Best Pacific Rim Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;3rd place, Best Place To Impress A Date &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From: &lt;a href="http://66.51.169.160/best.cfm?pitid=1027&amp;amp;plid=8" target="_blank"&gt;http://66.51.169.160/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ginzacuisine.com/Ginza/theindex.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ginzacuisi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165709293000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163789599000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Taste of Japan - Ginza in Bloomfield, CT!!!</name><id>5275081</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165536000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/5275081/</event_url></item>
