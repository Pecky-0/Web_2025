It is always an unforgettable event.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are races for children in the morning, a Pancake breakfast at 9am, and the Pro Racing begins at Noon time... I am going to put the Link for the Portsmouth Criterium Website right here...   I am actually a volunteer and will be working at the VIP tent right next to the Outdoor Cafe at Popovers, which happens to be the best and most comfortable spot to watch the races... I will try to save spots for any of you who decide to come.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, from 11am- 5pm Market Street is closed down with the Life Style Expo so during breaks in the race you can walk around and check out vendors that sell products for Healthy Life Styles..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Streets will be shut down at 7am...so the best place to park is the Hanover Street parking garage.. Same place our group has met for a few bike rides... Also there is a new lot up the street from the Hanover St Garage that has meters but will be Free on Sundays. &lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the schedule and I can assure you it is a great time... For those attending the best place to meet is Popovers on Market Square.. and to insure a seat I would recommend getting there by Noon time if not sooner!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the Way if you can't spend the day (which I highly recommend you do) the race to see is the one at 3:45 these guys are &amp;quot;The Best of the Best&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.portsmouthcrit.com/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.portsmouth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Schedule&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:00 am   Street closures start/Course set-up begins&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;8:30-10:30 am Kid's Race Registration opens&lt;br /&gt; Bank of America Parking Lot&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;9:00-11:00 am Smuttynose Pancake Breakfast&lt;br /&gt; Market Street&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;10:30 am Race Registration opens&lt;br /&gt; Bank of America Parking Lot &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11:00 am&lt;br /&gt; Kids Races begin&lt;br /&gt; Congress St. &amp;amp; Maplewood Ave.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;11:00 am LifeStyle Expo opens&lt;br /&gt; Market Street&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;12:00 pm Men's Cat 4 Race begins&lt;br /&gt; Market Square&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1:00 pm Men's Cat 3 Race begins&lt;br /&gt; Market Square &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:00 pm Community Challenge Race begins&lt;br /&gt; Market Square &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:45 pm Women's Pro/1/2/3 Race begins&lt;br /&gt; Market Square &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3:45 pm Men's Pro/1/2 Race begins&lt;br /&gt; Market Square &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see many of you there...It's a great experience especially if you have never been to a Pro-Race!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I shall be doing my best to Save them a Table...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cyndi</member_name><member_id>3604417</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285004291000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283315917000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Smutty Nose Brewing Company presents the Portsmouth Criterium</name><id>14614804</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284910200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/14614804/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/2/global_17636546.jpeg</photo_url></item>
