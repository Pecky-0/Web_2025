From despoiling an exhibit at the Natural History Museum to provoking the ire of her first boss to siccing the cops on her mysterious neighbor, Crosley can do no right despite the best of intentions-or perhaps because of them. Together, these essays create a startlingly funny and revealing portrait of a complex and utterly recognizable character that's aiming for the stars but hits the ceiling, and the inimitable city that has helped shape who she is. I Was Told There'd Be Cake introduces a strikingly original voice, chronicling the struggles and unexpected beauty of modern urban life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in the cafe area of the bookstore and place a copy of the book on the table so that the group is easier to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266948724000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264453916000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Readers: I Was Told There'd Be Cake</name><id>12420393</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266775200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/12420393/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/7/global_12800615.jpeg</photo_url></item>
