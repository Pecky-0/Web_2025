Your dominant vibration is your point of attraction. 
&lt;em&gt;Feel good, and you will attract good.&lt;/em&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;Do you just wait for good feelings to happen depending on your circumstances; or do you make a point to deliberately create your feeling good state? Do you know how?&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The more you deliberately feel good, the better it gets. And, as my favorite law of attraction teacher Abraham says, "The better it gets, the better it gets!"
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Join us so you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Find your "happy place".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Learn and practice some simple NLP techniques for creating super feeling good states with your imagination - getting fully tapped in, tuned in and turned on!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;- Learn how to enhance your internal imagery to be even more powerful.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;- Create associated "triggers" that you can easily reactivate at any time to re-access the positive feelings you "rehearse" in your virtual reality.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;- Talk about how you can use these techniques to create a positive, feeling-good state whenever you want, and to diminish not-so-feeling-good states; and to be better at attracting what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an encore presentation.&amp;nbsp; Here's Charlene's comment from that evening:

 &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;
&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;"What a great way to end the day! I needed this today, and am grateful to have been acquainted with a powerful tool that works whenever I choose to use it!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's create an amazing evening together with some awesome "take aways"!&amp;nbsp; We're sure you'll&amp;nbsp; leave with&amp;nbsp; "good, good, good, good vibrations"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate and honor your "yes" rsvp by either showing up or letting us know if your plans change by changing your rsvp. Many of you have been wonderful about this, and we very much appreciate your understanding, consideration and support! Thank you!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to co-create with you!
