Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an island known for its tropical beauty, tourists flock to the resorts of the Dominican Republic. Not 10 miles away, thousands of dispossessed Haitians labor in the sugarcane fields under slave-like conditions, cutting cane that will eventually end up in the United States as sugar. Narrated by Paul Newman, director/co-writer Bill Haney's documentary follows Father Christopher Hartley, a charismatic Spanish priest, as he organizes some of this hemisphere's poorest people to fight for their basic human rights. Father Hartley must go up against one of the country's most powerful sugar baron families, the Vicinis, and even the government of the Dominican Republic, to give voice to these Haitians, frequently receiving threats to his own life.  Kendall Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haney explores his subject in a way that allows him to splinter off into dozens of intriguing areas that have relevance to people of all cultures and social classes. The Price of Sugar isn't just a movie about poverty, or about Haiti's problematic relations with the Dominican Republic; it's a movie about how easily we're all manipulated by the media, corporate interests, and our own prejudices   Reel.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complete review is here: &lt;a href="http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=145710&amp;amp;Tab=reviews&amp;amp;buy=open&amp;amp;CID=13#tabs" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.reel.com/m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film, Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row and then its off to  a local restaurant to discuss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194989568000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193500095000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Price of Sugar- A Documentary</name><id>6626658</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194816600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6626658/</event_url></item>
