I will also give out my cell phone # to all that sign up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jaypeakvideo.com/2010/10/moment-of-clarity-world-premiere-2/" target="_blank"&gt;http://jaypeakvideo.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we will meet the the Snowsports Expo before the After Party (that is why it is called an After Party).
