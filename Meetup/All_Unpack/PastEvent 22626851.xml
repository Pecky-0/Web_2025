<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be the second meetup for &amp;amp; about energy work in Somerville. Following on the co-created model of the first meetup, the evening will involve time for networking and connections, group meditation, and learning about different modalities (Reiki, EFT, Polarity/RYSE, etc). We'll also get to experience giving and receiving (sharing) energywork! Feel free to bring a small object or crystal for the healing altar and a notebook or journal if you want to note any of your experiences, share contact information, etc. Healthy snacks (with ingredients listed for allergen-sensitive participants) also welcome! As always this evening should be about what best serves YOU, so other ideas and in-the-moment developments are fully embraced and appreciated! &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309292360000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Healing Practitioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-healers-network</urlname><id>511093</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Healers Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308367258000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Embracing your Inner Healer (aka "Somerville rocks!")</name><id>22626851</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309215600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-healers-network/events/22626851/</event_url></item>
