TP's is a great restaurant, lounge, sportsbar, with a good size dance floor, and yes, Lisa of Mama Kicks can be a little crude, but her and her group sure do know how to rock on to my era music, and keep me on the dance floor. it's my angel Lauren's birthday and might need some company that night, and a whole lot of dancin'! I'll make reservations for dinner for 7:30 so let me know in your reply if you'll make it for dinner and introductions. Once the band starts, you're on your own...look for me on the dance floor ;) Hope to meetup with you soon...&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signs will be on tables...look to right of dance floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330066926000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
