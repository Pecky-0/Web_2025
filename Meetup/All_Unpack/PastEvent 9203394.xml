<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the last meetup was cancelled, we still went, and had a blast.  The comedians were a blast.  Anyway, We are going to do it again on the 7th of December.  Since we have over 350 members, I'm going to have to limit this one to the first 32 members that sign up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meals range from 6 dollars, to about 20.  Plus the $1 donation here for miscellaneous fees.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The atmosphere is really cool here.  The walls have a ton of posters, pictures of famous people, and even a few faces sticking out of the ceiling.  The menu is like a comedy show itself.  It has all jokes of names of the meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am taking over this meetup, I am looking for people to come with an idea.  Along with the idea, please bring pricing, dates available, menu's, etc.  I will assist you with the meetup, but it will be your meetup.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;  You run the show, and create the fun.  For each meetup, we will assign a team to manage each part of it.  The team will support you to set it up.  Each team member will do a small part, to make it easy for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be from 7 to 9, then the comedy show goes from 9 to 10:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have any ideas, or just want to have fun, come on along.  We want to meet you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dress code for this meetup is casual.  (jeans and sneakers are acceptable)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve C.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be at the front table.....C U There !!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve C</member_name><member_id>6197158</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229474368000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
