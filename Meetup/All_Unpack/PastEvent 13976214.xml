The LANDMARKS ORCHESTRA CONCERT -Beethoven Symphony No 8 is going to be playing at the Hatch Shell. For those of us who can, let's meet at a place called the Sevens and have a drink or a quick bite before heading over to the concert together.  It is a cool pub and only 2 blocks from the Arthur Fiedler bridge into the park for the Hatch Shell. Very convenient. It isn't possible to reserve space but we'll try to find a table or some elbow room. Since it's a weeknight, it may not be a problem. If you can arrive between 5:45-6:15pm, look for me with blue balloons (even at the pub) so you can find us. Bring snacks to share at the park (if you feel like it) and and definitely something to sit on. Parking may be a challenge - not sure.  I plan to take the T - green line. It's a 20min or so walk to the Sevens from Arlington Station but the Boyleston or Park street stops should work fine also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's rainy, we may have to cancel but hopefully the weather will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sevens &lt;br /&gt;77 Charles St&lt;br /&gt;Beacon Hill&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02114&lt;br /&gt;(617) 523-9074 &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan C</member_name><member_id>6899147</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280003172000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278021380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hatch Shell Concert - Beethoven's 8th</name><id>13976214</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279748700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/13976214/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/6/global_5526982.jpeg</photo_url></item>
