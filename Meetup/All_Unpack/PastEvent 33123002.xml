&lt;p&gt;You will enjoy a 6- course FEAST with a musical and adult comedy show in a Medieval setting, presided by a King and a Queen, and served and sung by bawdy wenches &amp;amp; court boys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner includes: Bread and cheese trenchers, mussels, soup, beef ribs, salad, herbed chicken, and steamed vegetables. Included in the dinner is pitchers of beer, wine, mead or root beer, and a CASH bar also has a larger variety of beer, wine, soda and mixed drinks available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show begins at 8:30 sharp (do NOT be late as you will be made an exapmple of by the King!) and the doors open at 8:00 which is when we will be gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost is $50.00 per person, and MUST be paid within 10 days of making the reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be collecting money from NOW until our Samhain Celebration on Sat. Oct 22nd-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I do not have the money by that date, you will NOT be able to go- no exceptions!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would PREFER to be given a check or cash, but if you are unable to do this, and need to use paypal, email me at talawolf7@webtv.net and I will send you a paypal link that can be paid with a credit card. You can mail checks to me, stating on the check that it is for Medieval Manor at: Robin Paladino, 84 Old Boston Turnpike Rd. Hubbardston, Mass 01452-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or you can give me the money in person at classes or at the Samhain celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring some extra CASH for the bar and to leave a TIP at the end of the show....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
