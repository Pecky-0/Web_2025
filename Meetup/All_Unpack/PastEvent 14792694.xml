We had a phenominal season with a great group of players!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Come to Paddy's in Portsmouth for some food, drinks and pool!   The website is:  paddysgrille.com.  Check out the menu and the pricing.  Feel free to bring a guest or two.  I am asking everyone to email me famous or infamous moments, phrases and situations you remember from the season.  I am going to gather all of the information and put together a fun trivia game with prizes.  Awards will also be handed out! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there!!!  Only 7 months until we will be back on the beach again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lori&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the bar!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287448141000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284656126000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of Season Beach Volleyball Banquet</name><id>14792694</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287270000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/14792694/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/c/global_2393356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
