Hope you can join us for a short hike through the woods -- a walk paced for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at West Rock, which is a Connecticut State Park located in New Haven and Hamden.  There are various entrances to the park, but we will be parking at Lake Wintergreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the Lake Wintergreen entrance, which is located on Main Street at 1:00, and we'll start walking by five after one. We will hike for about 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please contribute one dollar towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website. Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. Please donate no more than $12 per year -- you keep track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECTIONS: &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT use the directions from the park website.&lt;/strong&gt; Please use Google Maps (or, your GPS) to find the intersection of Main Street and Valerie Court in Hamden -- this is the closest possible intersection that is actually listed on Google Maps, as the lot itself is NOT listed. &lt;strong&gt;From Main and Valerie&lt;/strong&gt;, drive DOWNHILL on Main Street and you will see the parking area at the bottom of the hill, where Main Street bends to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is no fee for parking in the lot.&lt;/p&gt;
