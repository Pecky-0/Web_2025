When we choose to present ourselves to the public boldly and consistently we offer them a power of example. Do not underestimate how much this means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please, if you are able to spend an hour (or more) with us....come on. Bring your signs, your flags, your husbands, wives, girlfriends, boyfriends and children too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park legally. Bring creative signs designed to educate. Do not block car traffic or foot traffic. Smile and let people know that we are NOT the crazy ones!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In patriotism,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>SIGNS, SIGNS, and MORE SIGNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna R.</member_name><member_id>8973743</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253377378000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252187216000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mini "T" Party @ Original Location (Routes 220 &amp; 5) @ 2:00 PM</name><id>11299299</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252778400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/11299299/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/4/global_10345540.jpeg</photo_url></item>
