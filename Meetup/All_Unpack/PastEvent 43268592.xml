Exploring a new medium, style or direction? Or, perhaps you have nothing new to show and could use some inspiration to get the fires burning again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show &amp;amp; Tell events are like focus groups for the creative mind. Bring your creative ideas, projects or fine art to share with the group. They are also great for making friends, learning about new resources, and marketing your work or business. Trading of Business Cards is highly encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a Macbook Pro and iPad on hand if you want to show off photography, your website or share a technique in Photoshop, Indesign etc.. with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical events last 1-2 hours over tea or coffee, desert, a beer and sometimes dinner. RSVP's are limited to 10 for this event and guests are more than welcome! Meetup will run with a minimum of 5 RSVP's so as the event nears keep an eye on "who's coming" list as there may not be time to let you know about a cancelation. Also if you change your mind, change your RSVP so we are not wondering what happened to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one time dues of $5 is requested the first time you attend a Show &amp;amp; Tell, this helps to cover the monthly fee I pay to meetup for this group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to meeting you!&lt;/p&gt;
