<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Debbie came up with a good idea for a ride on saturday. She found out that there is a free cookout at Shooters in Wareham sat. afternoon at 2:00.&lt;br /&gt;So here is the plan, We thought we could &lt;b&gt;meet at Friendlys in Middleboro around 10:00 and leave at 10:30.&lt;/b&gt; From there just ride all over the place and end up at the cookout at Shooters at 2:00.  I know most people probly have plans already for the fourth, but if anyone is interested and of course if it's not raining . Darn! Then by all means come ride with us. I am going to finally take my baby out for a ride.....&lt;br /&gt;If you could send this info out to the group, that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;I hope all is well, hope to see you soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Judi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at Middleboro rotary friendly's at 10am and leave at 10:30am&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey Juda</member_name><member_id>9039356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246965929000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246364709000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wareham ride</name><id>10768334</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246716000000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/10768334/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/b/global_9177195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
