<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>*****************IMPORTANT!!***********************&lt;br /&gt;All this week, it's rained, rained, rained, and it's going to rain again on Sunday!  Although the Puggies don't mind getting muddy, the people do, so I have rescheduled the second South of Boston Pug May Meetup to Sunday, May 21, 2006!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've had our first meetup for all those Puggies who live south of Boston, and we're ready to have another! Once again, I will volunteer my fenced yard in Brockton, MA (don't worry, it's a perfectly safe neighborhood of single family homes!), and we can discuss locations for future meetings.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll provide biscuits (Old Mother Hubbard, my favorite! sez Clovis) and water for the puggies and coffee and donuts for the Pugaholics.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a bully on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1149013403000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1144609656000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug May Meetup</name><id>4896981</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1148234400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/4896981/</event_url></item>
