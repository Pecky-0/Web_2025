Looks like the MFA Sunday Eye-Opener is the only time I can make it. The plus side to  these 10:30 am screenings is the event is over so early that there is still plenty of time for other things to do in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the MFA's description: &amp;quot;Manufactured Landscapes by Jennifer Baichwal (Canada, 2006, 90 min.). Edward Burtynsky is internationally acclaimed for his large-scale photographs of nature transformed by industry. Photographing civilization's materials-quarries, recycling yards, factories, mines, and dams and debris- in a way often described as beautiful, Burtynsky raises questions about ethics and aesthetics without offering easy answers. Manufactured Landscapes follows Burtynsky as he photographs the evidence of China's massive industrial revolution, transforming his still images into moving ones. Ã?Â¢Ã¢â??Â¬Ã?â??A protracted exploration of the aesthetic, social and spiritual dimensions of industrialization and globalization... Raises some sigificant and sobering questions about the impact that we, as humans, make on our environment&amp;quot; (The New York Times). Shot in Super-16mm film, Manufactured Landscapes extends the narrative streams of Burtynsky's photographs, allowing us to meditate on our profound impact on the planet and witness both the epicenters of industrial endeavor and the dumping grounds of its waste. &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the review in The Boston Globe: &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;amp;id=9921" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.boston.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the movies conclusion, Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row and then we'll stroll down Huntington Ave to a NEastern Commons area for conversation and a bite to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183561441000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182549363000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manufactured Landscapes- A Documentary About Modern China</name><id>5923603</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183300200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5923603/</event_url></item>
