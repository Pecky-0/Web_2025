Join lilac enthusiasts from all over New England to celebrate. A dazzling array of over 180 kinds of lilacs with delightful fragrances and gorgeous colors-plus tours, dancing, art, music, children's activities, and food (picnicking allowed on this special day only). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the thousands of flowering plants in the Arboretum, only one, the lilac, is singled out each year for a daylong celebration. On Lilac Sunday, garden enthusiasts from all over New England gather at the Arboretum to picnic, watch Morris dancing, and tour the lilac collection. On the day of the event, which takes place rain or shine, the Arboretum is open as usual from dawn to dusk. Refreshments are available for purchase from 10 AM to 4 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Street parking along the Arboretum perimeter is limited and visitors are encouraged to take public transportation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet inside the Forest Hills T station at 10:30, in front of our beloved donut shop. We will walk to the Arboretum from there and then go to that Indian restaurant on Center St for lunch afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210689167000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208738897000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lilac Festival 100th Anniversary</name><id>7777993</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210516200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7777993/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/global_3864123.jpeg</photo_url></item>
