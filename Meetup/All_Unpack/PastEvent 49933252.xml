&lt;p&gt;The Early Ford V8 Club guys that we do the Wings and Wheels show with are holding their 42nd annual car show at the airport on April 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car guys bring in thousands of people and it is a good opportunity to talk to the public and show them that airports, pilots, and airplanes are not their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we have the added ability to make some money for the chapter. They have asked us to provide the food. We are working to setup a tent and sell some breakfast in the morning and some burgers in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like previous years, I would also like to setup a table with our literature and park an airplane or two to show. It is a little less than two months before the June YE event and we usually get a lot of people picking up YE forms. I previously brought my airplane out for people to see and it was neat to watch them oogle it.&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/d/d/event_22789885.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if I could get 15 or 20 people to help with the show. I need people to hang around the table and answer questions about aviation as well as help in the food area. I am also looking for a 1 or 2 airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335142117000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327716196000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>V8 Club Car Show</name><id>49933252</id><headcount>2000</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335087000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/49933252/</event_url></item>
