&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SONO ART CELEBRATION 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We'll meet in front of the SoNo Regent 8 movie theater at 10:30 AM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's right near the largest parking area in South Norwalk where most of us will likely be parking. We'll hang around for 1/4 hour while people arrive. If you can't be here at 10:30 that's OK. I will distribute my cell phone number to everyone who signs up for the event, so you'll be able to find us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We'll meet again at 12 PM for lunch at the Black Bear Saloon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;My intention is we'll be done with lunch in time for the puppet parade at 1:30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a link to the program guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://issuu.com/soundmagazine/docs/sac2012guidefinal/1?mode=a_p" class="linkified"&gt;http://issuu.com/soundmagazine/docs/sac2012guidefinal/1?mode=a_p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the historic waterfront mystique of South Norwalk and its variety of restaurants and stores, you get an event not to be missed. For two days part of Washington Street is closed to traffic to allow for stages to be erected, providing venues for music and other performing arts entertainment in three locations all day long. Lining the streets, artists set up their booths to sell their photography, paintings, collages, furniture and ceramics. You'll also find performing artists walking around the event. And then there's the puppet parade you see pictured here. Some of the bars will have bands playing during the event. There is definitely something for everyone here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of all that, there are two museums and the Maritime Aquarium in the midst of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also say that Sono Arts Festival was the site of my all time best first date. I think the energy generated by the event had a lot to do with that. It's a place where people can connect on a lot of different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
