Hull Breach! has launched!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;In preparation for future events, The Game Den is devoting this Wednesday's Board Game Night to Hull Breach!&amp;copy;, the "tactical, operational, and strategic space-combat and logistics card game for two or more players."
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Each player is the Commander of a space station, and it's time for war! After an initial&amp;nbsp;
&lt;span&gt;setup phase, each player takes turns, using their own decks, building up their fleet, and potentially attacking the other players at their stations. Last player with a station standing wins.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;If you don't have a deck, you can buy one at the store, or you may be able to convince someone (probably James) to lend you one.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;If you don't know how to play, someone (probably James) will teach you how to play.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;If you can't make it, show up anyway... Or invite someone who can.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The tournament formats for the game are still in their developmental stages, so all player feedback on this is greatly appreciated. Winner will get their choice of promo card from those available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the brick building, can not really miss it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Szewczyk</member_name><member_id>4695834</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1314228472000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1313876324000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Board Game Night at the Den</name><id>pvjbzyplbgc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1314223200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/30248781/</event_url></item>
