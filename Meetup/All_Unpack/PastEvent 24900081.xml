<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Join a small group of permaculturists and sub/urban homesteaders for our August gathering at member Wendy Brown's home in Old Orchard Beach (she's just off of Route One). &amp;nbsp;Learn about her family experience raising rabbits for about the last 10 years for meat (it was their first "livestock"). &amp;nbsp;Learn about the breeds they have kept and their learnings about general care (housing, food, water, etc.). &amp;nbsp;Wendy and Eric can talk about (but will not be demonstrating) the processing side of things, whereby the rabbits become food for the family. &amp;nbsp;We will have a hands-on exercise in tanning some rabbit hides. &amp;nbsp;Participants can take home the tanned hides in exchange for a small cash or barter contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please only RSVP 'yes' if you really think you'll make it, as the RSVP size is super-limited on this one. &amp;nbsp;If there is alot of interest in this topic we'll look at another way to get the material out there in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 Potluck supper (please bring a dish/beverage to share and your own potluck kit)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:00 Announcements and start of Rabbit Husbandry Discussion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30-7:45 Hands-on Tanning Exercise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:30-ish Wrap-up/Q&amp;amp;A as we go along....&lt;/p&gt;
