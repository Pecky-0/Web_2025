Before the days of computer effects and modern creature makeup, here is a fantasy alive with trick shots and astonishing effects, giving us a Beast who is lonely like a man and misunderstood like an animal. Cocteau, a poet and surrealist, was not making a &amp;quot;children's film&amp;quot; but was adapting a classic French tale that he felt had a special message after the suffering of World War II: Anyone who has an unhappy childhood may grow up to be a Beast.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pacific Film Archive calls it: &amp;quot;a feast for the fairy-tale faithful&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is being hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater during the credits. After the film we will go to a local cafe, probably Boston Shwarma -- a post-MFA group favorite, for kebabs, felafel and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174335172000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172848698000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Most Magical of All Films? - Beauty and the Beast</name><id>5529848</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174148100000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5529848/</event_url></item>
