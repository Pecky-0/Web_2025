Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Folk Festival - For those of us who love folk music or love it once in a while.  Outdoor concerts can be great fun for groups.  Come enjoy the tunes together.  BUT...if there's rain, we'll cancel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can locate us as a group if you can come to the field stage between 1:15pm and 2:00 pm. I'll bring blue balloons again! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each person can buy their own tickets and make their way to the event.  Public Transportation is a cinch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subway: Take the Red Line to JFK/UMass Station. A free shuttle bus will carry you to the campus. Commuter Rail: Take the commuter rail to the JFK/UMass station from the South Shore on the Middleboro and Plymouth lines.

What's your pleasure? Is it singer-songwriters, blues or Americana music? Do you like to celebrate tradition or to discover new, up-and-coming artists? The breadth of folk music at this year's Boston Folk Festival is again as rich as it is diverse. You don't have to be a connoisseur to enjoy our folk festival - but it helps to have a love for all different forms of music. And if the first ten years are any indication, you'll experience it all at the 11th Annual Boston Folk Festival. We've got two stages and more for you to choose from each day. So, whether you prefer to stretch out a blanket or sit in a chair on the harbor-front stages, you'll be hearing some of the best music around. It's the biggest folk festival in the Boston area, and the greatest place to be if you like live music. Overall, it the best music from quality folk talent, the finest food and craft vendors from the New England area, and a fun, friendly atmosphere for the entire family.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lawn area at the Field Stage between 1:15pm-2:00pm.
