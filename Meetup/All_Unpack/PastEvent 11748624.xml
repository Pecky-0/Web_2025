You've walked through and thought that you should know more about these buildings and how Harvard started a million times, here's your chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Established in 1636, the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony established a college in Cambridge and later named it Harvard College for its first benefactor. Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The architects featured on this &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/catalog/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot tour&lt;/a&gt; are a Who's Who of the best practicioners in the field: Charles Bulfinch, Henry Hobson Richardson, Guy Lowell, Le Corbusier, and McKim, Mead &amp;amp; White.  There are stories featuring grazing cows, Revolutionary War hooligans, that famous statue and its multiple untruths, the first printing press in the colonies and what they got up to with it and how a beer magnate had to wait to get his dreams fulfilled.  We will also talk about the history of this august institution and how its development over its nearly 375 year history can be traced through the buildings in the old and new yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet at the Johnston Gate (McKim, Mead and White, oh my!) which faces out towards the statue of Charles Sumner and Church Street.  Tour is $15 for the general public and $5 for card-carrying BBF members and docents.
