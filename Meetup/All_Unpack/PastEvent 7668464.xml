It has provided a great community for like-minded software developers, managers and coaches to get together in a very informal way to discuss the ups and downs of using XP and other agile Software Development methods on a wide variety of projects in all sorts of organisations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar group formed in New York in January 2007, and the Boston group formed in September 2007.  The Boston group has since decided to move its meetings to Thursdays because of conflicts with other things on members' schedules.  We are currently planning to hold meetings on the first Thursday of each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to try a new place suggested at a previous meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The May meeting will be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Thursday, May 1 from 6:30pm&lt;br /&gt;    * Felt, 533 Washington Street,, Boston, MA 02111&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nightclub and restaurant on three floors with billiard tables.  We hope we'll be able to find a quiet spot in it on a Thursday night, and maybe we'll even play some pool while talking about agile software development.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My photo and those of some other regulars are on the blog at http://xtcboston.blogspot.com as well as here at Meetup.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Don Roby</member_name><member_id>5713230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209854453000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Extreme Programmers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>xp-28</urlname><id>840210</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>eXtreme Tuesday Club - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207264246000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>eXtreme Thursday Club - Boston May Meeting</name><id>7668464</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209681000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/xp-28/events/7668464/</event_url></item>
