Do you enjoy hearing yourself speak – or sing?  Are you good at ‘giving voice’ to your opinions and needs?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Voice Movement Therapy (VMT) is an expressive arts therapy that addresses these concerns, as well as many issues that are dealt with in more traditional therapies.  VMT explores and develops the physical voice while using this exploration to identify problematic attitudes and beliefs.  As the voice develops into a more expansive instrument, new life competencies are developed within the individual.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Deborah Crane has worked as a Voice Movement Therapist for almost ten years after training with Paul Newham, founder of VMT.  She is also an accomplished counselor, trainer and performer and has served as both a director and president of the International Association for Voice Movement Therapy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This workshop will provide a very brief overview of VMT followed by a playful exploration of some of the principles and practices of this new and effective approach.  Please dress comfortably for deep relaxed breathing and movement.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will welcome you at the front door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1263141585000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254187690000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name><id>11493590</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262968200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/11493590/</event_url></item>
