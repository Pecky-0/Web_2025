This is a security entrance that will bring you guys down to ice level. Door 5 is off of Major Taylor Boulevard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the scoop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you sign up and pay for this event by October 7, 2009 all photographers will be given “full access credentials” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;– So what does this mean? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will get a full tour of the facilities.&lt;br /&gt;Then during the game have access to the entire arena. &lt;br /&gt;Including the catwalk above the ice, the tunnel where the players line up, and after the event - access to photographing the players signing autographs on the ice. (Please note however that the Locker Rooms are OFF LIMITS – no one goes in there. Period.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have excellent seats if you want to sit and watch the game. If you have a family member or a friend who would like to attend the game they will get the same price on the tickets and can join you in the stands. The seating section we have reserved is in the Gold Level seating section of the arena. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In exchange for the all access passes we have been asked by the Sharks to please share our photos with them. They would love to use them for the photo gallery section of their web site. Which is the most frequently visited section of the site. You can have your © Name listed on the photos. So if you agree to the all access passes – you’ll be asked to give Donna Dufault a cd of your images as Jpegs to share with the Sharks. The deadline for this is October 29th, 2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We asked about “Model Release” issues – Turns out there is a statement on every ticket- and it is the policy of the Venue (DCU Center), that if you attend any function in their facilities you automatically agree to being photographed and have a “release on your likeness” by simply entering the building. So we are covered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Photo Ops:&lt;br /&gt;The Fans &lt;br /&gt;The pre game events&lt;br /&gt;Action shots of the players&lt;br /&gt;The arena and all its glory&lt;br /&gt;The Ice&lt;br /&gt;Crew members&lt;br /&gt;Tunnel Line Up&lt;br /&gt;Shark Pit&lt;br /&gt;Autograph session&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Game Time is 7-9PM &lt;br /&gt;But we have to meet ahead of time to hand out tickets, get the tour, get set up with credentials, and sign wavier forms. So you MUST meet us at 5PM at Door 5 – it is off of Major Taylor Boulevard and we will need to go in as a group. Please do not be late, or you will miss out!!! No refunds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We think this will be an incredible evening of fun and an excellent chance to get cool photos. We hope you’ll join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scott and I are booked this night so Linsey from the Sharks has offered to take care of sign ups. Please got here to sign up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sharksahl.com/photoclub/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sharksahl....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at Door 5</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255988122000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253031312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Want to Photograph the Opening Game for the Worcester Sharks??</name><id>11378312</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255815000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/11378312/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/d/global_10729485.jpeg</photo_url></item>
