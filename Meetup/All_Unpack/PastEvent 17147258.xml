I will be waiting at the tables near the upstairs concession stand starting at 6:30PM and we'll head into the movie around 7PM. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don't see us before, we'll gather for a bit outside the theater after the movie is over and then head to dinner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the Yahoo Movies description:&lt;/p&gt;

The lone woman charged, Mary Surratt, owns a boarding house where John Wilkes Booth, and others met and planned the simultaneous attacks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Against the ominous back-drop of post-Civil War Washington, newly-minted lawyer, Frederick Aiken, a 28-year-old Union war-hero, reluctantly agrees to defend Surratt before a military tribunal. Aiken realizes his client may be innocent and that she is being used as bait and hostage in order to capture the only conspirator to have escaped a massive manhunt, her own son, John. As the nation turns against her, Surratt is forced to rely on Aiken to uncover the truth and save her life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genres:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Drama and Biopic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release Date:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;April 15th, 2011 (limited)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MPAA Rating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;PG-13 for some violent content.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Roadside Attractions, The American Film Company &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the group tradition, I'll pick a place for us to eat/drink and discuss the movie after the show and depending on interest. If you have any suggestions, feel free to post them in the comments, send me a message, or just come with your thoughts. Hope to see you there! :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Meetup sign and will be waiting by the tables in the upstairs lobby of the theater at least a half hour before the show.
