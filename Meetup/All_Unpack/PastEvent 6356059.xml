Although Boston isn't exactly famous for arcades, the Good Times Emporium in Somerville is about as close as it gets to what you might experience in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect laser tag, go carts, video games and far too much noise - isn't it great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here's a great way to relieve some stress for all of those who work long days, study late nights, or just want a chance to show off their DDR and Guitar Hero skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Info and Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Time Emporium Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodtimeemporium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodtimeem...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Sullivan Square T Stop:&lt;br /&gt;The Sullivan Square Station on the MBTA Orange line is within walking distance to Good Time Emporium.  From the upper level of the station, you will walk to your left towards Broadway.  Take a left onto Broadway.  Walk up three blocks until you come to a set of lights at the intersection of Mt. Vernon Street and Broadway.  Take a right, walk straight past the next set of lights onto Assembly Square Drive.
