<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It is the last week of June and the final meetup of the month will commence with writing exercises.  I will not be able to attend this week as I will be (fingers crossed) basking in the sun on a glorious beach.  Still that is no reason why the rest of you can't meet up :) If anyone would like to volunteer to run the meetup, please shoot me an email.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look towards the back of the cafe</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247011648000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245631673000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>June Writing Meetup Blow Out!</name><id>10703559</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246402800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/10703559/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
