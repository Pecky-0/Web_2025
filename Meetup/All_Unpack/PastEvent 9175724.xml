We will be meeting at the AMC movie theatre in Tyngsboro around 4p.m. to see a movie (Will let you know later what's playing next weekend).  Everyone can see the movie of their choice and then we will all move on to have dinner at Joey's Diner in Amherst NH.  The diner has great 1950's atmosphere with old music playing and great food.  Looking forward to having a great time!&lt;br /&gt;Please, if you change your mind on coming or not coming, be sure to update your answer on our site! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be meetin at the movie Theatre to see a movie first</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227971662000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226885661000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a Movie</name><id>9175724</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227387600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/9175724/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/c/global_4915132.jpeg</photo_url></item>
