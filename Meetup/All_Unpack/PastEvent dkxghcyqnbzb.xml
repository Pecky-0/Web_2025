<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been requested to change our Stammtisch-location to a different Providence location every once in a while instead of meeting in Pawtucket each and every time! So in hopes that many of you who have already signed up for next Friday's meetup will still be able to come and that many more of you will join us, I have changed the meetup location to be at an old time favorite German Club bar - the Trinity Brewhouse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trinity has a excellent selection of beers and tasty foods anywhere from burgers and sandwiches to pizza and pasta. In honor of the Oktoberfest season they are even serving a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grilled Sausage Platter*................................14.95 &lt;br /&gt;

 A German classic with grilled ale braised Bratwurst and Bregenwurst sausage served with house made sauerkraut, horseradish mashed potatoes and a mixed greens salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what I am having for dinner of Friday!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know by Thursday noon, if you are able to make it so I will have a pretty accurate head-count for the table reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see many of you on Friday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a great week until then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Hanna&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
