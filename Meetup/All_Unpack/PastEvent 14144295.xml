<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have one Bring a small white light for this event to meet boat regulations for evening paddling. flash light or what ever.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using a headlamp even though it dosen't meet the regs but it works to where you can argue it and it helps in packing up so ya won't loose equipment. As long as most of us have a light its ok,&lt;br /&gt;if DEP ever confronts, just say yours fell in the water and we are in a pod..etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tide effect on this river is more favorable for Tuesday and not good for the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;We will be starting at the half tide point and riding up as it rises to the dam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tides for Higganum Creek (Close enough for a reference) starting with July 20, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day        High      Tide  Height   Sunrise    Moon  Time      % Moon&lt;br /&gt;           /Low      Time    Feet    Sunset                    Visible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tu  20      Low   3:06 AM     0.3   5:34 AM     Set 12:39 AM      65&lt;br /&gt;    20     High   8:18 AM     2.3   8:19 PM    Rise  4:06 PM&lt;br /&gt;    20      Low   3:06 PM     0.4&lt;br /&gt;    20     High   8:52 PM     3.2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather: &lt;a href="http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/launch/code.cgi?Submit=Go&amp;amp;sta=KHFD&amp;amp;state=CT" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.usairnet.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a Snack for the stop at the Ghost Town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose 6 pm so most of you can make it, and lets get going by 6:30 pm since sunset and dark is on the way back for the tunnel of LOVE site  diversion. im going directly from work to the site but will be there &lt;br /&gt;a bit earlier for those that may want to have a riverside dinner, let me know if you are earlier .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is something close for most all of us.&lt;br /&gt;There will be a few course changes and interesting areas we will pass through so it wont be the exact same back track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all my trips, i don't give specifics,  its for your discovery as i discovered them for my first time,&lt;br /&gt;and i don't offer the paddling time or mileage.. when we are done ..we are done--- when we are done paddling then its the barbie-q.. anticipate the entire day and a good part of the evening by a nice fire.&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting There:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to get to this PUT IN location by SALMON COVE is by using the same directions to GOODSPEED OPRAH HOUSE,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For GPS use 117 East Haddam Moodus Road, East Haddam,&lt;br /&gt;The Meetup* location Map link above is correct for a visual map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Getting There, From Hartford:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take I-91 south: take Exit 22s. (left hand exit) = Route 9 South , take Exit 7, (rte 82 to the Goodspeed Oprah House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the exit ramp take a left onto Middlesex tpk=rte 154 for a few hundred feet then back onto rte 82 east, cross the river and pass the oprah house and slow down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a sharp left onto rte 149  at the Gelston House. Be Careful at this intersection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The State boat ramp sign and road is 1 mile north of the left on rte 149 after you turned from the Opra House..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;br /&gt;Kayaks available:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Paddle &amp;amp; Paddle Leash, Life Jacket with whistle is included with any of my yaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doughnation of  $ 20.00,  bucks for my kayaks reserved for this particular event.&lt;br /&gt;Its way less than what sport shops charge and the yaks &amp;amp; Paddles are top quality delivered and picked up at the site etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you are familiar with the yak you choose and can fit in them since i don't have any &amp;quot;Wide Butt&amp;quot; (greater than 17&amp;quot;~18&amp;quot; butts) yaks anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Don't laugh, its serious, some will not fit in a yak thats too small (ie the Greenlander Pro) of an opening and i will feel sad you cant go..etc..the other option is to maybe trade with someone..etc ..if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;This has worked in the past very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will only bring the yaks that are confirmed by a yes and by persons i have some familiarity with ?..(ie paddle skills matched to the boat, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybee's obviously can't reserve any yaks &amp;amp; if ya reserve one and don't show up, ya won't ever get a second chance to again unless its some real good excuse..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry i don't like to leave un-attended yaks on the trailer. They get stolen too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF USING MY YAKS YOU CANT LOOK LIKE A BONEHEADED BEGINNER AND STEP INTO THEM VIA THE FLOOR (yes the lightest kayaks have thin fiberglass or wood and your feet will go through them) OR DRIVE UP ON SHORE WITH THEM LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO A DRIVE IN MOVIE. ( In an 18 foot long boat you will still be 10 or so feet out in the water at a greater depth.) Only Novices in short wide cheap plastic boats do that kind of thing.  :-)~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INFO ON THE FOLLOWING LINK: I will also show you the correct way and you will look like a intelligent seasoned pro and impress the others who don't know how. Then you may laugh at the ones that fall in on entry and exit who don't know how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5660364_enter-kayak.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ehow.com/h...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: Always enter and exit while being parallel to shore.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;Please review the links below for the equipment specifications to be at least familiar with which boat or equipment you would be best suited for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap LIfe Jackets with a whistle is all i have for most of you since a GOOD QUALITY LIFE JACKET should be chosen for your particular body shapes , paddling  style, and  fit adjusted...if you have your own please bring it..&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;I only have one &amp;quot;GOOD&amp;quot; life jacket for someone that can fit in it.&lt;br /&gt;Its a Medium Kokatat* Ladies MsFit  Tour: (this is also purchased by guys since it has a great fit and versatility) Its really too small for  me...but i like the way it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rei.com/product/751058" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rei.com/pr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;All my yaks come with Werner Carbon Kalliste Paddles (my recommended brand and type).
