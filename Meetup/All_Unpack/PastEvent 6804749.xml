<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a lot of fun hiking and of course eating on Thanksgiving Day, so I am scheduling another event for those who are free on the holiday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where and when: 11am at the Belmont Habitat parking lot.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Belmont Hill, just 6 miles northwest of downtown Boston, lies Habitat, an 87-acre urban oasis that has been devoted to environmental education since 1970. Over 2.5 miles of gentle trails wind through deciduous and evergreen forests, across meadows, around 2 ponds, and along a wetland containing a vernal pool. The visitor center is a brick Georgian-style mansion where monthly art exhibits can be viewed. Outside, there?s a pleasing and calming formal garden. The building and gardens can be reserved on weekends for weddings and other events. This sanctuary has the following universally accessible facilities: Nature Center, Restrooms, Garden Terrace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;habitat@massaudubon.org &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we have a potluck holiday dinner at my house in Arlington Center.  I will send out directions to those who RSVP yes or maybe closer to the date.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198773051000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196087960000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Belmont Habitat and Holiday Potluck</name><id>6804749</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198600200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6804749/</event_url></item>
