I will call Yama ahead of time to verify the ingredients of the vegan menu options. The cost of lunch will be whatever you order, but usually meals at Yama range between $5-10 (before tax and tip). I'll even bake a vegan dessert to bring to the Meetup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why Yama?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who responded to the previous e-mail seemed most enthusiastic about trying Yama (or at least thought it was the most conveniently-located option). We'll try a new restaurant next month. In the meantime, if West Lebanon is inconvenient for you, please let me know. I want as many people as possible to be able to participate in these Meetups, and I don't mind driving outside of the Upper Valley area from time to time if it would make our events more accessible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please send veg-friendly restaurant recommendations my way! I know of approximately 5 vegan-friendly restaurants (places with more than one or two vegan options on the menu) within a one-hour driving radius of Hanover, so things could get very repetitive very quickly. Lastly, if you like the idea of having a potluck, please let me know. Once the weather warms up, I think it would be nice to have a Vegan Meetup potluck somewhere scenic.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear a "vegan" T-shirt.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lola</member_name><member_id>915277</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208876551000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Yama has a great selection of Korean and Japanese vegan options, including vegetarian sushi, soba noodle dishes and scallion pancakes.</why><group><who>Pioneers of Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-430</urlname><id>650201</id><group_lat>43.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2699966431</group_lon><name>NH/VT Vegan Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206304500000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First NH/VT Vegan Meetup</name><id>7587969</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208620800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-430/events/7587969/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/global_1994793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
