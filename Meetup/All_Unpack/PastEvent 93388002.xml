&lt;p&gt;Please join us for an evening of food, drink, socailizing &amp;amp; dancing. If you can't make it at 7 pm.? Join us anytime. But, if you can get there early to help us hold seats and tables. &lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/0/f/c/event_7917596.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;It would really help. Even if you don't want to eat with us. Please understand, this place fills up really quick. So, we can not guaranty that we can hold a seat for you.  But we will try. As Always, Steve Ob1. will do his best to make sure everyone gets introduced.  They usually have for $20. a two for one deal. It has been a really good deal in the past. If there have it still. So, who want to split the $20. with me? The last time we danced to Moma Kicks. We had 16 join us, and we dances all night. But the event was only posted hours before. So, now we have it posted almost two day before. We should have a good size Groups of dancers this time. Moma Kicks is one of the best Bands to dance too. You can hear what Moma Kicks sounds like. &lt;a href="http://www.mamakicks.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.mamakicks.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
