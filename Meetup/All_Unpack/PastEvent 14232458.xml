Gargoyles will be offering a 3-course dinner for just $33.10 (note: gratuity and drinks are extra, of course, but the Gargoyles website states that they have wine tasting on Wednesdays.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Located in Somerville's Davis Square, this delightful, somewhat upscale neighborhood establishment over the past decade has evolved into one of Boston's best restaurants without losing it's local flair. No wonder Boston Magazine named it the Best Neighborhood Restaurant for the past 3 years.&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gargoylesrestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gargoyles on the Square&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the reservation is for six people, I would be grateful if you only RSVP if you are reasonably confident that you will attend.  A waiting list will be created as well.  If more than six people RSVP, I will try to increase the reservation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.restaurantweekboston.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston Restaurant Week&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be the bald dude carrying a camera and a little foam elephant.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282176553000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280263838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Gargoyles on the Square</name><id>14232458</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282172400000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/14232458/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/b/a/global_16761770.jpeg</photo_url></item>
