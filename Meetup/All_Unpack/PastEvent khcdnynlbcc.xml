<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A terrific multi-generational event!  We will be led by Patricia to not only talk to plants, but also to hear them!  Taught by her grandmother as a young child, Patricia has an ongoing dialogue with all plant people.  She wants to share that world with you.  As the shift comes, we will be more and more reliant upon what is around us for food and medicine, so this topic is very timely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be ready for a good time, good food, and good conversation.  Bring enough to feed at least four people and we start at 6 PM!   See you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, people who are not on the meetup list attend, so do not be discouraged by the numbers of RSVP's!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282647075000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277816871000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Talking and Listening to Plants</name><id>khcdnynlbcc</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282428000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/13946748/</event_url></item>
