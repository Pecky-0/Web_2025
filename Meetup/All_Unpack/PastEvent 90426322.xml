This time the items they need are more specific and none are clothing. Might be easy to haul down. I think if we get about 6 people to split up the day working Saturday, we would be able to easily pile the donations up awaiting their pilots and co pilots. Once we get this agreed upon with enough workers/planes we can put it out to Facebook and local media for donations. Once again, thank you everyone for helping with our talent of flying!!!
