This is a repeating  meetup, every two weeks on Sunday, and I may not always be able to attend.  You should park on the common in Montague Center and walk to the entrance at the end of North Street.  Parking at the entrance to this site is extremely limited.  This is a very pretty area with trails through fields and woods, located just minutes from the Montague Center common.  The Sawmill River intersects the area which is lush with wildflowers, trees, and butterflies.  Come enjoy a stroll, swim, romp and run!  Dogs should be on leash to begin with.  This is a dog friendly area, please be prepared to pick up, there are is a trash can and usually there are bags available on site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a tree/log crossing for the stream, however, I prefer to wade across in water shoes.  It's a lot more fun if you come prepared to get your feet (and your dog!) wet.  Bug repellent is a must.  Come play with us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call Kristi Cell if questions - 413-230-6757&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see pictures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2003081&amp;amp;l=6643b&amp;amp;id=1419625521" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.new.facebo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>On the common, w/vanilla PT cruiser and  a black lab with a bright blue leash.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristi</member_name><member_id>7010444</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284835521000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281628582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Montague Center - Sunday Morning Dog Group</name><id>nxcgpynmbqb</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284303600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/14460010/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/7/1/global_15103905.jpeg</photo_url></item>
