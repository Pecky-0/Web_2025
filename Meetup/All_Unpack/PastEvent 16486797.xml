Do you wish you knew how to approach people  that you're attracted to, and talk to them in a way that will make them  interested in getting to know you?  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to  either of those questions, then you're going to love this month's  workshop.  You'll learn simple, proven conversation starters that are  non-threatening, and practically rejection proof.  Once you master this  simple skill, you'll have the confidence to approach people in any  situation, and you will know what to say to get them talking.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Imagine  being at a Meetup event and gliding around the room talking with anyone  and everyone.  You'll surprise yourself with how easy and effortless it  is to strike up conversations with total strangers and get to know  them.  Once you have this skill, you'll be able to make friends and  attract lovers anywhere you go, anytime you want.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;*************************************************  &lt;br /&gt;HERE'S A SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:  &lt;br /&gt;*************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3  simple, proven conversation starters you can use in almost any  situation (including one that works REALLY well in places like coffee  shops and malls, and another one that works almost 100% of the time at  parties and social gatherings).  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to actually talk about after you start the conversation (and which topics people find interesting).   &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can quickly become confident at meeting new people so it's never scary again.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The  secret to getting people to open to you, even if you just met them.   Once you understand this, you can build deep friendships &amp;amp;  relationships with anyone you want.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little-known places where people are more friendly and open to being approached.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A  proven method for ending a conversation that will leave people feeling  good about you. If you've ever wanted to end a conversation with  someone, but were worried about offending them or hurting their  feelings, then this is perfect for you.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5  attraction-boosting tips that will make people even more receptive to  talking with you (it's easier to meet attractive strangers when you look  your best, and these tips will maximize your chances of success).  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more!  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;*************************************************  &lt;br /&gt;HOW TO GET INVOLVED  &lt;br /&gt;*************************************************  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The  meeting is limited to 35 people due to the size limitations of the  classroom (we'll be moving around a lot).  Our meetings usually sell out  quickly, so here's what I recommend.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;#1 - Check your  calendar right now, and see if you have Sunday, February 13th available.   The meeting runs from 3:30pm to 5:30pm and is conveniently located in  Harvard Square, less than 5 minutes walk from the red line.    &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;#2  - If you have that evening free, go ahead and RSVP for this workshop  right now.  Trust me, it's going to fill up fast.  They always do.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;#3  - Write it in your calendar so you remember to attend, and please  arrive at 3:15pm for registration and personal networking.   &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The  cost of the event is only $20, which is a bargain for a professional  training that includes these skill-building drills + personality  feedback.  Please remember to bring:  &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$20 cash &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pen &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great attitude &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a willingness to learn fun, new things. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to seeing you there.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Eric &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;P.S.  - Take down my cell number in case you have any questions about the  event or if you get lost.
