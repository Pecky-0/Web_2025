Got a flyer at the pet store today for Paws in the Park, a dog walk being held at Borderland State Park on October 10 at 11:00am. Proceeds benefit the Animal Protection Center of Southeastern Mass.  Know that someone mentioned this park before here so passing on this info.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.apcsm.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any one who would like to connect with other members meet in front of the information/bathroom building at 10:45am. there is no leader for this event, just facilitating connecting with one another. I will not be there so disregard me as a leader (don't wait for me)....Jacqueline&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meet in front of the info/bathroom building at the parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacqueline </member_name><member_id>7535746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287193250000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286676122000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paws in the Park 10/10/10</name><id>15059027</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286721900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/15059027/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/6/global_4112918.jpeg</photo_url></item>
