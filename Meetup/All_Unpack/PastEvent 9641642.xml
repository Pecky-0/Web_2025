If you haven't been to a concert in Morse Hall, you should come join us for this event.  Morse is a beautiful hall, fairly recently renovated, and it's a great place to hear live music performed by some very talented folks.  And the price is right - free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the main lobby of Morse Hall at about 7:45, which is inside of Sprague Hall on College Street between Wall &amp;amp; Elm.  We'll head in about 5 of 8:00 to get seats - they shut the doors pretty promptly at showtime and don't let anyone in, so unfortunately there's no way to squeak in if you're running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the details about the concert from Yale's website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 &amp;amp; 2 Pianos, 4 &amp;amp; 6 Hands&lt;br /&gt;Special Event&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Music for one and two pianos, four and six hands.
