For those who are not in the know, Fat Tuesday is the day before Ash Wednesday when Lent starts and so is typically a day for eating, drinking and making the most of whatever bad habits you intend to drop until easter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, dont get me wrong.  I like to think that I dont have enough bad habits that I can afford to give one up (only an aquired fondness for the phrase &amp;quot;all set&amp;quot; and sometimes rhyming the word can't with ant instead of aunt).  And I have ABSOLUTELY no intention of giving up either food or drink for any reason, especially not for some bloke who is supposed to forgive you all your sins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress, they day just worked well in my calendar really.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hope you will be able to come out and meet up - if I have picked a bad day and enough people tell me I can reshedule.  Hope to see you out!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1141344637000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1139258947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fat Tuesday Meet Up Drinks</name><id>4848678</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1141171200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/4848678/</event_url></item>
