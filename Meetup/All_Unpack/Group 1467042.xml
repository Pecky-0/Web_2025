That would include discussions around electronic health care records, integrating systems from vendors to "really" make them work together, and other topics of related interest. An important goal is to have members feature and present, informally, on topics of interest defined by the group and to have some fun doing it. This is a new group as of June 3, 2009, and I hope that it will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, information, and the opportunity to learn and network in a relaxed atmosphere. See you there. P.S. Vendors are welcome too, especially to sponsor meetings, but no sales pitches during meetings is our policy. Thanks for observing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>5.0</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1244163899000</created><lat>42.5099983215</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>24023</id><urlkey>boston-health-care-it</urlkey><name>Boston Health Care IT</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>24024</id><urlkey>electronic-medical-records</urlkey><name>Electronic Medical Records</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>24025</id><urlkey>health-care-it-reform</urlkey><name>Health Care IT Reform</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>24026</id><urlkey>stimulus-act-health-care-it</urlkey><name>Stimulus Act Health Care IT</name></topics_item></topics><name>Boston Healthcare IT Professionals</name><id>1467042</id><members>141</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>29805572</member_id><name>Jon Nugent</name></organizer><urlname>Boston-Healthcare-IT-Professionals</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/1/c/600_162726172.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/1/c/highres_162726172.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>162726172</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/1/c/thumb_162726172.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Burlington</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Healthcare-IT-Professionals/</link><lon>-71.1999969482</lon></item>
