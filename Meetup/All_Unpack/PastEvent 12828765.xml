One thought depending on conditions is to spot cars. This way we can do the hike one way (4 miles) verses 8 miles roundtrip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweet Trail to Great Bay Estuary...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post Hike following Map &amp;amp; Compass Workshop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four miles long from Longmarsh Road in Durham to the Great Bay Estuary in Newmarket, the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sweet Trail&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; leads hikers by a remarkable array of upland forests, freshwater wetlands and tidal salt marsh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1973, shipping and oil magnate Aristotle Onassis planned to build the world’s largest oil refinery on these lands here on Durham Point, with a pipeline stretching all the way out to the Isles of Shoals. Had those plans materialized, they would have forever changed the nature of Great Bay and New Hampshire’s coast. In 1974, however, the plans were defeated by well-organized local residents who understood these lands’ value for nature, recreation, and beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Conservation Partnership&lt;br /&gt;Widely recognized as an estuarine ecosystem of local, regional, and national significance, New Hampshire’s Great Bay has been a focus of planning and management since the 1940s.  Formed by the outflow of five rivers, the Great Bay Estuary and its watershed encompass 9 percent of the state’s land area. Sitting at the confluence of approximately 930 square miles of major watersheds in Maine and New Hampshire, it brings a tidal flush of salt water from the Atlantic Ocean, located nearly five miles east. The inland location of Great Bay makes it unique in ecosystem and wildlife, providing rich aquatic habitat that supports more than 150 rare plant and animal species, and 55 exemplary natural communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRAIL GUIDE PDF&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;i&gt;this is a big file, takes a while to download&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;a href="http://durham.nh.us/generalpdfs/Sweet_Trail.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://durham.nh.us/g...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: if we have lots of hikers, we will break into smaller groups, staggering departures from UNH in order to create a more enjoyable hiking experience.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>will meet after Map and Compass and carpool to trailhead</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>7235827</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271701316000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268153873000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sweet Trail to Great Bay Estuary , Post Hike, following Map &amp; Compass Workshop</name><id>12828765</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271527200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12828765/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/b/f/global_13559055.jpeg</photo_url></item>
