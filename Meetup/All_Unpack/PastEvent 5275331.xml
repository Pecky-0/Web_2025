Come walk on the land with us, and see where our buildings will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To join us, meet us at the site First Sundays of the Month at 1:00. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cohousing is a type of neighborhood designed and managed by the people who live there. Cohousing combines privacy and community in a clustered, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You own your own home, as well as a share of the common facilities. The common buildings will include a large dining room, kitchen, living room, children's space, exercise room, and workshops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are planning to build on a wonderful site in Berlin, MA that we are sharing with Camelot Cohousing. We have 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes still available for sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www-mosaic-commons.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www-mosaic-commons.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www-mosaic-com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sawyer Hill EcoVillage</member_name><member_id>3420923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540739000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Community-Minded People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cohousing</urlname><id>368003</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6299972534</group_lon><name>Sawyer Hill EcoVillage: Mosaic Commons &amp; Camelot Cohousing</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163796041000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cohousing Site Walk for Mosaic Commons</name><id>5275331</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168192800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cohousing/events/5275331/</event_url></item>
