Michael DeSilver SVP, Cloud Services at &lt;a href="http://www.ltech.com/" target="_blank"&gt;LTech&lt;/a&gt; will give a talk about CloudManage - Turning Amazon Web Services into Amazon Managed Services.  I came across Michael &amp;amp; LTech when Aprigo was looking to get some help in managing our AWS environment as we expanded our product offering and ventured into more complex deployments, and so I'm happy to share this with other folks who might be in similar need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LTech is also sponsoring this event - so thank you Michael on behalf of all the hungry attendees rushing to the event after a long workday!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Ellen Rubin - Founder @ &lt;a href="http://www.cloudswitch.com/" target="_blank"&gt;CloudSwitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CloudSwitch delivers the enterprise gateway to the cloud.
