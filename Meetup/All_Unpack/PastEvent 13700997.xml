Apparently they have changed the decor and gone to an &amp;quot;Inspired Mediterranean Cuisine &amp;amp; Mixology&amp;quot; offering. The bar area is huge and there's LOT's o' room, so I'm anxious to see if its changed that much. I remember when it was an abandoned building - even then it looked like a great space, and look at it now. Its history is pretty interesting too, so let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us> I'll wear some kind of scarf, but you can't miss us!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
