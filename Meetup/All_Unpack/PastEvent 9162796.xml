La Tuza plays traditional Mexican roots music -- really lovely. And Sofia Koutsovitis's music is grounded in traditional South American genres -- but laced with jazz and more contemporary stylings. This should be a very savory evening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note: my musicians microfinancing project has just launched with a new live album project for Alex Alvear and his group Mango Blue. He is traveling to Mumbai, India to perform and record a live album. He is raisning funds to release the new project -- you can preorder a copy and you'll get two tickets to his album release party. please go to &lt;a href="http://tuneyourworld.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://tuneyourworld....&lt;/a&gt; to learn more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you really can change the way the world finances music... ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope to see you next week,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brad&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be standing at the bar before the show starts</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Powell</member_name><member_id>930768</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229223733000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226684300000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>LA TUZA &amp; SOFIA KOUTSOVITIS at Johnny D's</name><id>9162796</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227061800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/9162796/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/c/global_6307772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
