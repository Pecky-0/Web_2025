We will be touring my futuristic home, it is half built, building the other half the &amp;quot;Dome&amp;quot; this summer, so come out for the tour and if you want stay for the food and game night.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be having another meetup club there so there will be plenty of people! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(We were going to have a skating party but there is too much snow on the pond behind my parents house to so I'm changing it to a bonfire party.) We will be meeting at 6 pm, in Durham, bring plenty of food for a pot luck dinner. The party is at my  parents home.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please park out on the street. Bring something to cook on the fire if you like. &lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions give me a call at 603-509-2907.  &lt;br /&gt;See you there!  &lt;br /&gt;Peter.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235084787000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Green Earthlings</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-286</urlname><id>459660</id><group_lat>43.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast  Energy and Permaculture Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231678867000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Party / Game Night/ Dome Home / Meeting</name><id>9497314</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232233200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-286/events/9497314/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/d/global_6893341.jpeg</photo_url></item>
