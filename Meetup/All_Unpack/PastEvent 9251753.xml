We are very fortunate to have Rafael Osuna-Montanez lead this informal lecture followed by a discussion period. Rafael is a Graduate Fellow in Hispanic Studies at Trinity College in Hartford. He also organizes the Latin American and Iberian Film Series. His half hour presentation will be in Spanish. English Speakers - don't be intimidated - it's a wonderful opportunity to sharpen your language skills, and we can help each other out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin our evening as usual at 7 pm chatting and sharing a pot luck dinner. Please bring a dish to share! The lecture/discussion will begin at 7:30 followed by the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: There is a limit of 25 people, so sign up soon. There is no &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot;option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!Nos vemos!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Dworski</member_name><member_id>2589505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232493674000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228072790000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trinity College teacher, Rafael Osuna-Montanez, gives lecture on Spain</name><id>9251753</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228867200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/9251753/</event_url></item>
