All you folks that asked about snow shoeing, here we go.  We need to jump on this opportunity and head out into the storm.  &lt;br /&gt;I have shoed in this place before and it was great.  Also since it is in central MA they will have snow.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who need equippment, call Eastern Mountain Sports in either Manchester or West Hartford.  The rental is $15 a day and that includes poles.  The folks there are a big help in terms of the size you need.&lt;br /&gt;We are looking out heading out for about 4 hours.  Everything is of course dependant on the exact conditions post storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Holyoke Range State Park is a little North of Springfield with 3,000 acres! The exact length and path covered on this hike will depend on the weather conditions.  Most of the hike would be moderate in difficulty with some limited opportunity for high-moderate exertion. Streams, forest, and quiet solitude will dominate the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go need to have: &lt;br /&gt;* A daypack - To carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail food and water. &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed warm hiking boots or comfortable winter boots (no sneakers!) - There could be snow or it could be wet/muddy! &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks - To keep those feet warm even if wet. &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing - Avoid cotton as it stays wet/cold. Don't forget your legs can get cold too. &lt;br /&gt;* Gloves - MUST have &amp;amp; warm ones too! &lt;br /&gt;* Jacket - BRIGHT color best given hunters (not advised to wear white, dark green, brown, tan, dark grey, or black if possible -see vest below if must wear). &lt;br /&gt;* Hat - You loose 20% of your heat through your head! Protect those ears too. &lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water - MUST bring! &lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate food/lunch - (e.g. at least G.O.R.P -Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, beef jerky, granola bars, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;* Bright clothing -(I don't mean white!) To prevent hunters from mistaking you for game. I'll have 2 orange vests in the party already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advised equipment depending on conditions:&lt;br /&gt;* Gators or snow pants - Suggested, as there could be snow on the trail and you want to keep it out of your boots! &lt;br /&gt;* Crampons - suggested, to get through icy areas but not required.&lt;br /&gt;* Snowshoes and poles - Advised if there is 10 inches or more of snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jacket shouldn't be too heavy as other layers of clothing should add to your insulation to keep warm and layers would be added or removed as needed. While hiking you WILL be hot but if you stop you WILL get very cold after about 15 minutes and thus need more dry layers added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 9 AM at the Notch Visitors Center at the west side of the park (see the park map). Directions are below. We'll likely relocate to another parking location for the hike (south or north side of the park). We will hike (with rest stops and sightseeing) about 4 hr. and get back to the vehicles at about 1 PM. Then the plan is to head out to eat back down MA-116 in South Hadley. There are plenty of good places to eat in one place near Holyoke College.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S can provide carpooling for up to 6 from the Wal-Mart in E. Windsor ***leaving*** at a 8:15 AM for those interested. There will be a blue Dodge Grandcaravan Sport. Please chip in for gas and the drive is an hour. Return at about 4 PM. It is advised to call Kevin so he knows you plan to carpool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location/directions to meet at park:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=1540+West+St.&amp;amp;city=Amherst&amp;amp;state=MA" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location/directions for the carpool meet-up can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;searchtab=home&amp;amp;formtype=address&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=69+Prospect+Hill+rd.&amp;amp;city=East+Windsor&amp;amp;state=CT" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General park information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/hksp.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/Holyoke.gif" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this event is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
