Specific Start time to be posted when announced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEESWAX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; revolves around the personal and professional entanglements of twin sisters living in Austin, Texas. Jeannie co-owns a vintage clothing store with Amanda, a semi-estranged friend who she fears is trying to end their partnership. Lauren leads a looser, less tethered existence and is considering getting out of the country altogether. When Jeannie receives an email from Amanda threatening lawsuit, she calls her law student ex-boyfriend Merrill for help. Eager for distraction from his own problems, he begins to help the sisters with theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dir.
