<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's make March Meetup even greater, 113 members and increasing. Please RSVP. You must come to the Meetup to make connections, and many are doing so. We are becoming one of the best in the country. We keep getting new members, so it's important to come to all Meetups to find your best connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Hopefully we could have a separate room again. It does mean we would each have to pay $3 or less ourselves this time. But it's worth it. &lt;br /&gt;     We will be having someone show a video of one of his fashion shows he puts on... and who knows what else will be coming our way. &lt;br /&gt;     New members should bring photos or actual examples of their work to share. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1108685376000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Fashion Industry March Meetup</name><id>4263008</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1111100400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/4263008/</event_url></item>
