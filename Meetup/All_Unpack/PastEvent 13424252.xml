Dirt holds and cleans our water. Dirt heals us and makes us beautiful. Dirt regulates the earth's climate. Dirt is the ultimate natural resource for all life on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet most humans ignore, abuse, and destroy our most precious living natural resource.Consider the results of such behavior: mass starvation, drought, floods, and global warming, and wars. If we continue on our current path, Dirt might find another use for humans, as compost for future life forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't have to be that way. Another world, in which we treat dirt with the respect it deserves, is possible and we'll show you how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film offers a vision of a sustainable relationship between Humans and Dirt through profiles of the global visionaries who are determined to repair the damage we've done before it's too late. There are many ways we can preserve the living skin of the earth for future generations. If you care about your food, water, the air you breathe, your&lt;br /&gt;health and happiness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it's time to see DIRT! the Movie, roll up your sleeves for action and Get Dirty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;Along the same theme.....please consider a $10-20 donation to support our plan to turn Udderly Wooly Acres into a learning center for Nutrient Dense Foods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will you help us explore the feasibility of creating a living, working educational center for the growing of nutrient dense food in CT? Imani, John and friends are forming an official steering group, along with the support &amp;amp; guidance of Land for Good and longtime owners of Udderly Woolly Farm in Glastonbury (Tom &amp;amp; Joan Kemble) to determine by July 1st if our professional analysis tells us we can do it.  For this phase, we need 25 people to contribute $100 (cash or stuff to sell) to meet our Phase One Goal of $2500. We have a team of individuals committed to volunteer over 100 hours of their time over the next six weeks to perform a feasibility study and the money raised will hire Project Coordinator, Rene Dion and Land for Good Consultant Bob Bernstein &lt;a href="http://landforgood.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://landforgood.or...&lt;/a&gt; to assist us. Email me with your projected contribution!! The results of our findings will be available July 1st!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Imani</member_name><member_id>7960334</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273893113000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273347770000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"DIRT" A movie with Heart &amp; Soil</name><id>13424252</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273879800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/13424252/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/b/global_14899371.jpeg</photo_url></item>
