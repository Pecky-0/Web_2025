Anyone with an interest in Ayn Rand who would like to meet fellow admirers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should people come?&lt;br /&gt;To meet &amp;amp; drink beverages &amp;amp; socialize!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will it be like?&lt;br /&gt;Drink coffee, have fun, muse about anything from A is A to the moons about Mars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should members bring anything?&lt;br /&gt;Yourselves! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's a good ice-breaker question members can ask each other?&lt;br /&gt;How have you recently used objectivist principles in your daily life? (We probably use them implicitly all the time, so maybe think of a time when you thought about objectivism explicitly in relation to an everyday problem.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will members find you when they get there?&lt;br /&gt;I'll have dollar-sign bling bling. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175653388000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173049630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand April Meetup</name><id>5536703</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175461200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/5536703/</event_url></item>
