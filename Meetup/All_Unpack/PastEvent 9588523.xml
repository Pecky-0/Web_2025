Hearings can and do change times, dates and rooms for no apparent reason. I'll do my best to keep track of this and update any changes as soon as I know of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HCR6 is a resolution which is attempting to utilize a power known as State Nullification. This power was attempted to be utilized by the Southern confederacy prior to the War for Southern Independence. The result was warships parked off the coast of South Carolina during Jackson's presidency. I'm certain the fed has had time to cool their heels since then :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, it will be immensely interesting to hear our elected officials discuss the finer points of State's rights. &lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234030600000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232754334000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Public Hearing for HCR6</name><id>9588523</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233856800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9588523/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
