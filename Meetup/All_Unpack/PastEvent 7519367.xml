(There will also be the chance to play other games afterward, so please bring your favorites to play.)  Tara and Judy have been nice enough to host a game night in Tara's home in Ipswich, and it should be a really good time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring anything you would like to drink; pizza will be ordered sometime during the evening.  Just a note, this is a household with one dog and three cats who are inside/outside pets.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you have any extra folding chairs, please bring them with you.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternate number for the evening is Judy's: 978-380-0612.  Any question that you would have about the evening, please message either Tara or Judy.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208815589000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205351411000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Star Trek Trivia Night</name><id>7519367</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208642400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7519367/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/e/b/global_3466331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
