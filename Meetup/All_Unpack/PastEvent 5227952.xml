Tom, CT and then have a picnic lunch together in a picnic area beside the Mt. Tom Pond. Then we'll do the short hike up to the Mr. Tom Tower to take in the somewhat late fall view (it's earlier this year). The hike would be no more than 1.5 mi. in total length. This event should be over by 2:30 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the picnic, I'll provide soda and some long ginders (turkey or veggie choices). Please bring some food item or drink (non-alcoholic due to park rules) to share with the group for the picnic. **Please write your preference for grinder (turkey or veggie) and what you are bringing to share in your RSVP.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Tom is one of the oldest parks in the state park system; it is named for the mountain within its boundaries. There is a stone tower on top of the mountain that is a favored destination among hikers. The summit of Mt. Tom is 1325 feet above sea level, 125 feet higher than its Massachusetts counterpart. The tower trail is less than one mile long and rises some 500 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be a parking fee: $7 CT Resident, $10 non-resident&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the park (&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/mounttom.htm"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt; ).
