Since Robert works a non-traditional schedule, this is his &amp;quot;Saturday Night,&amp;quot; and we thought maybe some of you wouldn't mind meeting up on a weeknight.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have drinks and snacks and the option of ordering pizza if the the group decides.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note we do not have a lot of the traditional games, so if you have a fav, please bring it.  If you are a&lt;br /&gt;Catan player or Rio Grande games in general, we probably have it.  And if you haven't heard of Medici, Guillotine, Puerto Rico, Chronology, Vinci or the like, maybe you'd like to try something new.  And for all you Risk fans, that's still Robert's #1.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have two cats that are mostly in the basement.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leticia</member_name><member_id>10156175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268690421000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266369469000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Night Games</name><id>12623687</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268353800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/12623687/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/3/b/global_13157947.jpeg</photo_url></item>
