The Union Pond Trail loop is about 2.4 miles and we'll add on a spur of the Pitkin Trail for up to an additional .8 mile or overall up to 3.2 miles. Mostly easy hike great for beginning hikers. Some wet areas with great views of the Hockanum River and the 60 acre Union Pond. How much of the Pitkin Trail we hike depends on how much daylight we have left. The Pitkin Trail is hilly in quiet unspoiled forest along the river. This hike is a new hike and experimental in this first offering by this hiking group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park at the Robertson School, 65 North School Street, just north of the Main and North Main Street intersection. &lt;b&gt;Wait at the school parking for us all to assemble&lt;/b&gt;. From the school parking, we will go north on North School Street, around to the right past Union Pond Park, and then left into the driveway to the boat launch site. We will return to this parking lot. The hike should take about 1.5 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a flashlight or headlamp to help for the last bit of the hike as it is getting dark earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids are welcome. Dogs on leash are fine if well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate location/directions&lt;/b&gt; to parking and start (Robertson School, 65 North School St, Manchester, CT):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Manchester&amp;amp;state=ct&amp;amp;address=65+North+School+St" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Union Pond Trail map and trail information&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hockanumriverwa.org/LPCM_UnionPond.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hockanumri...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitkin Trail map and trail information&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hockanumriverwa.org/LPCM_Pitkin.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hockanumri...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hockanum River Watershed Association&lt;/b&gt; -preservation group for the areas affecting the river:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hockanumriverwa.org/HRWA_Home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hockanumri...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
