We believe that a long-term, fulfilling relationship is built on some fundamental values: Integrity, Honesty, Respect, Loyalty, Reliability, and Non-judgment in our communication with each other. We value each other’s opinion. &lt;br /&gt;2. We strive to be positive, optimistic, kind, giving professionals. How? We don’t criticize, condemn or complain. &lt;br /&gt;3. We value diversity in religions, nationalities, and ethnic backgrounds. We cooperate as a team to be successful by inviting other professional people we know. &lt;br /&gt;4. We demonstrate this respectful/ nonjudgmental mindset in two ways: &lt;br /&gt;A.  By saying Yes to someone who asks us to dance. (once) &lt;br /&gt;B.  By offering positive solutions or alternatives if you disagree with something.  (Please don’t criticize, condemn or complain) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invite other friends, particularly men.  My personal goal is to have an equal amount of men and women.
