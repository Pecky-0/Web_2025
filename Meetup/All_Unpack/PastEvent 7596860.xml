I am merely inviting everyone in the group to show up and ride bikes.  If you ride a vintage 3 speed beach cruzer you will fit in.  If you ride a $1500 carbon road bike you will fit in.  If you ride a custom built franken-bike with a basket for your pet poodle on the handlebars you will fit in. etc, etc, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Critical Mass?  it is best described as a leaderless party on wheels that meanders through the city and several suburbs.   The ride has no real political agenda, but you will often see politically charged individuals participating.  more info here: www.bostoncriticalmass.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People start gathering at Copley Square at 5:30, and once a large group has assembled, the ride begins!  (If you are running a bit late, dont fret... the ride usually starts just before 6pm) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;again, I am NOT the organizer but if you see me there feel free to say hello! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Jon&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You might not even find me!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon Ramos</member_name><member_id>4466935</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206913171000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>if you have never been to a critical mass bike ride, you haven't see it all.</why><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206415474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Critical Mass</name><id>7596860</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206739800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/7596860/</event_url></item>
