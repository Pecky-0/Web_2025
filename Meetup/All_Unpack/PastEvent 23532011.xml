Ask anyone&amp;nbsp;who may have attended one before and they will tell you they had a great time!&amp;nbsp;We will be having the the Murder Mystery party at Judi house, this is a private home in South Berwick, Maine!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;I want everyone to know this game is not a board game; everyone will be participating at the same time; you must not be afraid of the dark, and you must dress all in black clothing! This is not a show. We will be in a big home with two large&amp;nbsp;living rooms and plenty of space to wander around in and also to hide a victim!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;We will be having a potluck before the game so bring something special. We will meet at 6 pm to socialize at which time I will explain the game and give a brief tour of the house then at 7pm the mystery will start. This is not a child event so please do not bring your children.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;I anticipate we will have a fairly large amount of people coming so I will be limiting the number of people for this event to 25. I will be combining this event with another meetup group.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Please attend only if you are willing to actively participate, this is not a spectator event, be aware this event is played in nearly dark rooms.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;More details will follow as we get closer to the event.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;$3 or whatever you would like to donate at the door the night of the event. This is to help cover some of the expenses of running this event and this meetup group.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions call me (Peter)&amp;nbsp;at 603-312-6735.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;See you there for a memorable night!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Peter
