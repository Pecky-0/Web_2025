&lt;p&gt;We will start out with a POT LUCK dinner, from 5:00- 6:30 pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(details to be sent to the list!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be (3) contests with great Pagan prizes in each category:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- A pumpkin carving contest (you may bring your pumpkins home) &lt;br /&gt;

 (2) Prizes one child; one adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Halloween Trivia Contest (Adult Prize only for most correct answers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Best pagan "shade" contest &lt;br /&gt;

 (2) Prizes: one child; one adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ask: What is a "Shade" ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another thing pagans may do is make themselves up as "Shades" . What this means is that we paint our faces with black and white and gray colors, to look like the dead......and then go out and about.... We do this based on tradition... the reason for this is because it is believed that because this is the time where the veils between the worlds are the thinnest that the dead may walk among the living..... and the pagans at this time, if they wronged someone in a past life, and they were about, on this plane, did not want that "soul" to recognize them.....so this was a way for them to "disguise" and protect themselves on this night..... and that is where the &lt;br /&gt;

 Halloween's custom of "dressing up" as someone else came from..... &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then head down, for a huge bonfire, for a talk about upcoming Samhain,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have an open pagan chat, about ghostly experiences, near-death experiences, and life after death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also roast marshmallows, make smore's, and do some drumming and chanting-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families are welcome-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camping is also available &lt;br /&gt;

 (please let me know ahead of time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring a homemade pot luck dish, and $5.00 Donation to cover prizes, paper products, and your own booze-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there! :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Directions will be sent to list prior to meet up :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tala</member_name><member_id>5511934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350271531000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Wiccans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wiccan-169</urlname><id>793389</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0100021362</group_lon><name>Central Mass Wiccan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333242570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre-Samhain Bonfire Party</name><id>58713072</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350162000000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wiccan-169/events/58713072/</event_url></item>
