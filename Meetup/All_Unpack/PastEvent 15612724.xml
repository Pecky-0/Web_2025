All one sees and hears now is bright lights, big decorations, and one uninterrupted chain of carols. And of course, who can skip past all those seductive offers that gently prod you to buy this and that. How about some real holiday spirit, I say? Where can we bottle and sip some of that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I invite you to a special celebration--a less noisy and more nourishing one, I hope. Think of it as a literary gift-giving, of sorts. Let us each bring something we love and would like to share with the group: a poem, a tale, an excerpt from a play or a novel, anything literary really. Just amuse and surprise us. Each participant will have up to five minutes to contribute. You may chose to participate or simply listen. If possible, let us know in advance what &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; you are planning on, and if you can, bring copies of the piece to share with the group (it makes it easier to follow).  My gift to you will be my musings on one of Borges' entries from &lt;i&gt;The Book of Imaginary Beings&lt;/i&gt;. It may be the Crossbreed, an animal that is half cat and half lamb. It does not make any sounds, and refuses to chase after rats. What will you bring? &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292349297000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291241155000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Literary Celebration</name><id>15612724</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292194800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/15612724/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
