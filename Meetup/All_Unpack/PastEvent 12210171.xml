<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will make our own vegan spring rolls and play some board games, too!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spring roll fillings and wrappers will be provided; please bring your own beverages and other dishes to share if you like.  Please note that other friends of the organizers may also attend, so we can't guarantee everything will be vegan, but we will ask all attendees to label anything they bring if not vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll make a savory spring roll, with cabbage, carrots, tofu, and a spicy peanut dipping sauce, and a sweet one, with fruit and chocolate sauce for dipping.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Board games (probably starting around 7-ish) may include Apples to Apples, Sequence, Urban Myths, Tri-Ominoes, Eco-Flux, and whatever else people bring.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1805913</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268975984000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262562851000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Roll into Spring!</name><id>12210171</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268517600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/12210171/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_7118529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
