This will be our return visit! Come and join the New England GHOST team on our 2nd investigation of this site.&amp;nbsp; Our last investigation yielded terrific results!&amp;nbsp; We are very excited to be returning and opening this location up to all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 huge buildings (3 stories, basement and attics). Plenty of room to spread out and explore. Without getting in each others way. You are going to love this historic property. There is an old school house and the main house. Please bring sleeping bags, if you plan to stay overnight. Also, remember to dress the warmly. Layers are the best. One building is heated and the other is not. You will want to investigate both. We will be having a potluck dinner. So please bring a dish or something to share. $20 pp donation. All proceeds go to the upkeep and renovation of the property.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy </member_name><member_id>7992934</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aimee NewEnglandGHOST</member_name><member_id>15355761</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332803725000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>footsteps-paranormal-meetup</urlname><id>1305459</id><group_lat>42.5699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0</group_lon><name>Footsteps Paranormal Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330976065000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>~Parsonsfield Seminary Investigation~</name><id>55081892</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332626400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/footsteps-paranormal-meetup/events/55081892/</event_url></item>
