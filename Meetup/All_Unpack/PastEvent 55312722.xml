Everybody is doing it, so why can't we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in the age of the "experience economy,"&amp;nbsp;social scientists and marketers of all stripes&amp;nbsp;tell us. It's all about the "experience," as if this concept was&amp;nbsp;freshly thought up. Just what do they mean? Well, as far as I can tell, it's about using "experience" as a verb, which&amp;nbsp;one dictionary defines as&amp;nbsp;"to participate in personally; undergo." So, instead of serving you a ready-made something, "they," whoever they may be, would like to offer you something that you would like to participate in, and in so doing alter it and make it your own. That's the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;nbsp;you see where mashup comes in? It's about taking different things, toying with them, and coming up with something altered. Musicians do it,&amp;nbsp;tech people do it, even museum curators are dabbling in&amp;nbsp;it...so we can try it too. Let's read Nikolai Gogol's classic story "The Nose," about a man who lost control of his nose and discuss it alongside a recent and unusual story/essay by Miranda July irresistably titled, "Shoplifting to Stay Free." (find it below) And then let's see what happens...&lt;/p&gt;
