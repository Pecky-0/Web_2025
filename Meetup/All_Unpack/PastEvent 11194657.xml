Clare has been in love with Henry her entire life. She believes they are destined to be together, even though she never knows when they will be separated: Henry is a time traveler -- cursed with a rare genetic anomaly that causes him to live his life on a shifting timeline, skipping back and forth through his lifespan with no control. Despite the fact that Henry’s travels force them apart with no warning, Clare desperately tries to build a life with her one true love. --© Warner Bros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated: PG-13 (for thematic elements, brief disturbing images, nudity and sexuality)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Runtime: 1 hr 47 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genre: Dramas&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abdul</member_name><member_id>2464273</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254264958000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251203229000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie: The Time Traveler's Wife.</name><id>11194657</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251587700000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/11194657/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/6/global_10383750.jpeg</photo_url></item>
