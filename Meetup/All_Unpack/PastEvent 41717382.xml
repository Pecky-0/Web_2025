&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here's Betsi's description of this event: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inspired by virtual "a-thons" on the site AtcsForAll.com, we're going to spend a whole day (from 11am to 7pm) making collage artist trading cards using a few favorite tools and the materials provided. Live trading for the cards we create is highly encouraged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done a few of these online and they are always a blast! The idea is you take a weekend (or in this case just a day) and make as many ATCs as you can, and trade, trade, trade. Once you get going you'll be amazed how much you create! I thought it would be even more fun to do it in person, with everybody creating in one place and trading live and in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have lots of ATC blanks and sleeves available, and we'll start with some quick reviews for background techniques like&amp;nbsp; using tissue/ napkins for backgrounds and for rubber-stamped accents. We'll also cover some finishing touches, like using embossing powders with or without rubber stamps,&amp;nbsp; adding embellishments, using glazes and 'drawing in' to help unify your collaged piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each collage-a-thoner will receive a packet of collage goodies. You are welcome to bring your favorite tools (preferred adhesives, scissors, pens, a few rubber stamps, inks, etc.) and a small assortment of special papers and embellishments. Got something you've been saving for something "special"? This is it! But please limit yourself to no more than a half-inch (or so) stack of ephemera.&amp;nbsp; Making art quickly often happens best when you are restricted to just a small amount of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading will be informal. Just hold it up when it's done and say "Anyone want this one?" :)&amp;nbsp; At the end we'll display what we've made and (I hope) take some pictures of the ATCs...and conclude with a grand trading session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Anyone (18+, please). But you must sign up on the NE ATC+ Meetup site (which requires joining the group; membership is free and there's no obligation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt; These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting list. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. You may RSVP for a guest as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; All materials will be provided (included in your cost for attending). Even basic supplies -- scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are available for your use.&amp;nbsp; But if you have favorite basics, by all means bring them. Even if you show up empty-handed, we can get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; In the unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Enter through front or side door; proceed up stairs to second floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsi</member_name><member_id>5074581</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327974510000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321707099000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Collage-a-Thon 2012 at ArtStudio 360 in Holliston</name><id>41717382</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327852800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/41717382/</event_url></item>
