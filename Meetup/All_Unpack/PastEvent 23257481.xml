 Join us on Sunday, June 26, from 10:30 a.m. until 12 noon for a walk on a paved walking/jogging trail in Woodbridge followed by optional lunch. Fitzgerald Trails is located at 100 Center Road in Woodbridge, Connecticut, and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of parking at the Woodbridge Town Library at 10 Newton Road. If you stand in front of the library with the entrance behind you, in front of you will be the main parking lot and across the street you will see a white building with green trim. Walk to the street (which is Center Road) and cross to the other side of the street where the white building is. Turn left and walk about 50 yards.The walking trail will be on your right. We will meet on the walking trail adjacent to Center Road. If you arrive after 10:30 a.m., just wait at this location and you will see us in a few minutes as we walk around the track. You can also try calling Manny Ratafia on his cell phone at 203-901-9553 or Nina Stein on her cell phone at 203-215-0022.
