Chef/proprietor Anna Romagnoli will demonstrate the preparation of several complimentary courses of one authentic Italian meal that reflects seasonal cuisine. Keeping classes to small groups allows for dialogue, questions and answers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the food has been prepared, you’ll sit down and eat it together, Italian-style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy With Me is having a deal on this Italian Chef Demo.  This demo is normally $75, but from now through Sunday you can buy the deal for $35 at this web site: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buywithme.com/boston/deals/946-la-romagnoli-and-son?utm_source=the+BuyWithMe+Mailing+List&amp;amp;utm_campaign=751e14a9e7-BOSTON_Churrascaria_Body_7_13_10_948_947&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.buywithme....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classes run in the evenings from 7:30-9pm.
