This technique of Jyoti meditation involves no postures or breath control, and can be practiced by people of all ages, physical conditions, and faiths. Meditation has many practical benefits, helping to reduce stress-related illnesses, improve our concentration, and awaken us to our spiritual nature. In meditation, we withdraw our attention from the senses and world around us.  This allows us to gradually release thoughts of the past and future so that we live in the present moment and connect with a source of inner power. Please join us if you are interested in meditation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be the only group there.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>clare vidich</member_name><member_id>6909709</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270335778000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-588</urlname><id>1096567</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The Storrs Mansfield Meditation Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267751333000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Storrs Mansfield Meditation April Meetup</name><id>xxkdnyngbcb</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270162800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-588/events/12787840/</event_url></item>
