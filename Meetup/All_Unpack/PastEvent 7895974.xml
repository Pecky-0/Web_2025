I would hate for us to go and risk it.  So let's go to Black Eyed Sally's.  I think I have eaten there before and quite a few members have emailed me and suggested it.  On May 15th, they have Acoustic Stage: &amp;quot;Sally brings you the areas best singer-songwriters each week from 9-12. No Cover and $2 Coors Lights.&amp;quot;  So we can eat and then stay for some music!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The table will be under 'Kelly.'</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211065629000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><why>This is a fun group and we are going to a fun restaurant.</why><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210214409000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cajun Food at Black Eyed Sally's</name><id>7895974</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210892400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/7895974/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
