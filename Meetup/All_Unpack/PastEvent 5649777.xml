(on earth day itself the place will be a zoo...haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the aquarium contains a diverse variety of wildlife that can be found in and around long island sound. exhibits include an indoor/outdoor pool with harbor seals, a river otter habitat, a 110,000 gallon open ocean exhibit with sand tiger sharks as the main attraction, loggerhead sea turtles, a large cylindrical tank full of jellyfish, and for those who can't keep their hands to themselves, various touch tanks full of horseshoe crabs, sea stars, rays, and other bottom-dwelling beasties. there's also a nautical museum and an IMAX theater, which is currently playing &amp;quot;The Human Body&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Whales&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Ocean Wonderland.&amp;quot; for more information on any of this, visit the &lt;a href="http://www.maritimeaquarium.org" target="_blank"&gt;aquarium's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we'll get there around 1pm, which should give us plenty of time to check out the exhibits, maybe take in an IMAX show, and get lunch or a snack in the cafeteria there (the aquarium closes at 5pm). there's also the possibility of getting dinner and/or drinks in SONO afterward, and making a whole day/evening of it. if anyone has any suggestions, put them in your rsvp. if the weather is nice, maybe a place with a patio/outdoor dining area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i'll probably take the train in, as the aquarium is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the south norwalk train station. for those who intend to drive, there is a big parking garage right next door. additional details on parking can be found on the aquarium's website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;admission to the aquarium only is $11. there's also the &amp;quot;adventure pass&amp;quot;, which gets you the aquarium and one daytime IMAX movie for $16.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your contact for this event: ben (203) 554-5144&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177348086000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176052427000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sat. 4/21 - The NHC Does Animals!
