What does it take to allow your desires to manifest?  For one - letting go.  Also, getting into a flow state, present and connected, and letting whatever happens be okay.  It also helps to be in a high, positive vibration of feeling good, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are some of the same states you use when you &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; improv comedy!  And I'm sure we'll come up with even more.  Oh!  I just thought of another - letting go of what others think!  That's a biggie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetup member Karen Wagner is going to lead those of us who want to play through some improv games; and others can enjoy learning by observing.  And of course we'll also have a discussion around how this all connects to the law of attraction and allowing our desires to manifest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can't wait for this most playful of evenings! Thanks so much Karen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to RSVP, and after you do so,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt; let us know if your plans change, so we wonâ€™t be waiting for you unnecessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun.  Please join us!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eagerly looking forward to co-creating with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to back of front lobby, near water cooler and go upstairs.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6516126</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268974154000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266409349000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Art of Allowing through Improv Comedy!</name><id>hwpzkynfbvb</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268780400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/12626769/</event_url></item>
