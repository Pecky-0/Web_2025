You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. For more information see: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/everett" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=117251855265442394172.000454fbf746bc55f3c25&amp;amp;ll=42.408946,-71.07811&amp;amp;spn=0.047657,0.111237&amp;amp;z=14" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Metro nearly kicks us out @ 10 pm we go wine, whine and dine not too far from Everett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you there! &lt;br /&gt;Stephanie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I'll be around the picnic table until about 7:15 pm, after that you'll have to come find me. Check the whiteboard near the restrooms for description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metrorock&lt;/b&gt; is hard to find for first time visitors.  So if you find yourself going in circles here are some hints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the traffic circle near Wellington Station take &lt;b&gt;Santili Highway&lt;/b&gt; towards Best Buy and Mellon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=69+norman+st+everett+ma&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=42.403,-71.068557&amp;amp;panoid=tokB9E1LI2EyeX1sO6yBKg&amp;amp;cbp=1,373.0161768945875,,0,5.838644286822094&amp;amp;ll=42.404125,-71.068524&amp;amp;spn=0.002979,0.006952&amp;amp;z=18" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Best Buy is on your right and the Mellon building is on your left as you are going away from the circle, you are on the correct road.  Then, take a left when you see a sign (see lilnk below) that says Metro rock.  This sign is very very easy to miss as it is quite dark at night. Also, the road is full of potholes so drive slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=69+norman+st+everett+ma&amp;amp;ll=42.406646,-71.065568&amp;amp;spn=0.001489,0.003476&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=19&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=42.4059,-71.065688&amp;amp;panoid=NmauOeOz4LYml_YHJkOxjA&amp;amp;cbp=2,83.17320855493256,,0,4.854149774573699" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then take another left at this spot to Metrorock:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=69+norman+st+everett+ma&amp;amp;ll=42.408593,-71.065136&amp;amp;spn=0.001489,0.003476&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=19&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=42.407846,-71.065257&amp;amp;panoid=wJN8hOL4n0M0sZWUMUBiOw&amp;amp;cbp=2,312.6123350198842,,0,15.341210608227097" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal at the picnic table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Opal</member_name><member_id>3394775</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226970117000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223597342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rock Climbing Boston November Meetup</name><id>8933575</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226707200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8933575/</event_url></item>
