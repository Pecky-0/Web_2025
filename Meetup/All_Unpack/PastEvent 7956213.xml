If you'd like to have dinner first, plan on showing up by 8:30.  The Sahara is on Highland Street near the Sole.  The reviews that I've read indicate that their food is very good and reasonably priced.  Let me know by Friday afternoon if you plan to come for dinner so that I can make a reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a meetup group, we've seen Jason twice and there have been no complaints.  He's a lot of fun to watch and hear.  If you like rockabilly music (Bo Diddley, Johnny Cash, George Thorogood, etc.) you will LOVE Jason.  He can do things with a guitar that many musicians can only imagine.  See him once and you'll be hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no cover charge.  Jason for free - what a deal!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There will be a meetup sign in plain sight.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211767660000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><why>It's a lot of fun and we have a great group.</why><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211027907000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jason James and the Bay State House Rockers at the Sahara</name><id>7956213</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211594400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/7956213/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/1/global_4146945.jpeg</photo_url></item>
