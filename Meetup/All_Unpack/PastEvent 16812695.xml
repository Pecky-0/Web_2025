&lt;p&gt;This is the 4th of 4 Tues. preliminary contests at 4 different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.encorebuzz.com/superstar" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.encorebuzz.com/superstar&lt;/a&gt; for all details of the contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to compete. Hopefully, Tom D. will compete too. (He has competed in the previous 2.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cover charge to come and watch, but there is a $5 contest entry fee for participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration (to compete) starts at 7 PM and the contest starts at 8 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will cut off contest entries at some point if there are too many people signed up. (They haven't had to do this yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past experience has shown that the place gets filled up early, so  even spectators    should arrive as early as possible for seating. I  can't guarantee I can    save seats for everybody. Also, the place does  not have its own parking lot, so you need to find street parking nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't RSVP if you aren't sure you can make it, because it is  not nice to be trying to hold seats for and keeping an eye out for  people who don't show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have posted this event to other meetup groups too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
