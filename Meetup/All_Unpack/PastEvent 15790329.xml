Dreams provide keys for healing, direct guidance for the future, and greater states of self-awareness.  The true depth of dreams is recognized when we consciously work with them.  In this fun interactive evening, we will share dreams using the Lightning Dreamwork Process* and creatively explore dreams in a variety of ways.  Using Core shamanic techniques we will learn to consciously re-enter our dreams for guidance and additional information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress comfortably, bring a drum or rattle if you have one, a journal and a dream to share.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  The Lightning Dreamwork process is a quick powerful technique developed by Robert Moss, a world-renowned author and shamanic dreamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michele Ferro&lt;/b&gt; is a certified dream teacher in The Robert Moss School of Active Dreaming and has over 15 years of advanced experience in Shamanism.  Michele leads an Active Dreaming Circle in Providence, RI.  She creates a safe compassionate space and inspires people to find joy and peace in their life by connecting the spiritual and physical realities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payment is $10 and can be made online or in person.
