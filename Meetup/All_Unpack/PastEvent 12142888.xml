I can JUST feel it!!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I hope you can make this gathering, we have another amazing guest speaker lined up!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monique Morimoto Flaherty, MS, CPCC is a fellow coach and she will be speaking a bit about &amp;quot;Letting go the need to be perfect!&amp;quot;  We shall have Monique speak for about 15 minutes or so, then we'll do our normal breakout commentary..then come back to group.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me...this concept has proven to be &lt;b&gt;monumental&lt;/b&gt; in my personal/professional growth.  Growing up I always participated in the things I knew I was good at b/c I was afraid to look bad or to be a detriment to any team.  But what I didn't realize is, by focusing on the things I was only good at, limited my living and trying new things.   &lt;br /&gt;So last year, was the first year I began to practice this aspect of life by creating an affirmation that abolished this way of thinking and it has truly opened some incredible doors for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you on this wonderful personal growth journey who haven't really explored this..I strongly encourage you to come!!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring: an open mind...your favorite notebook, cash for bar, food and the $5 group fee.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More INFO on Monique... &lt;br /&gt;www.soulworkscoaching.com &lt;br /&gt;~~Voted one of the Top Ten Executive Coaches by the readers of Women's Business Boston, July 2008  &lt;br /&gt;~Recipient of the 2007 International Coaching Award for Community Involvement and Development  &lt;br /&gt;~Contributing Author in The Professional Woman Network  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZFOqJ5do5I" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/moniqmori" target="_blank"&gt;http://twitter.com/mo...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the hostess where Cocktails &amp; Conversations </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Danielle Lucido</member_name><member_id>8800487</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271376550000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Personal Growth Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cocktails-Conversations</urlname><id>1372859</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>Cocktails &amp; Conversations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261679372000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jan C&amp;C-- "Letting Go of the Need to be Perfect"-Guest Speaker Monique Flaherty</name><id>12142888</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264118400000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cocktails-Conversations/events/12142888/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/8/global_12377544.jpeg</photo_url></item>
