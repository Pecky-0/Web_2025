 &lt;br /&gt;

No Limit Texas Hold Em Poker Tournament &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

$30 buyin, no rebuys, no house rake &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We do have a game-funded Bad Beat Jackpot, $5 from tournament buyins and $1 from cash game pots that are $10 or higher fund it.  Presently at $60.  Qualifier starts at quad 2's being beat, but each time we play drops, currently at Kings full losing.  Players must use both holecards to qualify for the BBJ.  Payout is 50% to loser, 25% to winner and 25% split between everyone who played that day. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Address is &lt;span&gt;2 Omelia Road, Broad Brook CT&lt;/span&gt; (part of East windsor) &lt;br /&gt;

phone is 860-597-3776 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Game is 100% non-smoking (not even outside, it'll just come back inside and the wife will kill me) &lt;br /&gt;

We have two kittens in case anyone has allergies &lt;br /&gt;

 House is on the corner of a four-way intersection, HUGE yard, large 3-bay barn/garage and a smaller shed on the property.  Park near my silver Camry, enter through the deck on the side of the house.  Please remove shoes and leave on shoe racks.  Bring slippers or thick socks if you wish. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

BYOB, or any food/snacks you want for yourself or to share, we'll make room in the fridge. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I can accommodate 10 players total, but have 5 players already locked up, although two of those are members of the group: &lt;br /&gt;

Larry Gregory &lt;br /&gt;

Ron Swiller &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

So I'm not sure how you'd set that up at Meetup, since some attendants aren't on Meetup. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I think that's everything, let me know and thanks so much! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
