<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We should celebrate the Oscars in style with a game night full of movie games.  We would love to have you over to play Cinemaplexity and Scene-It, as well as any other movie games you may have.  The Meetup will start at 5:00 p.m., and the Oscars will start at 8 p.m.  You are welcome to stay for part or all of the Oscars.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have plenty to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats, but they will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to a well-behaved one year old, who will obviously not be locked up for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is a little tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets. In the event of a snow emergency, this event will be canceled. Should the weather turn, please have our number with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Members who have been a &amp;quot;no-show&amp;quot; in the last three months will not be permitted to RSVP for this event. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1268172560000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265575522000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oscar Night Meetup</name><id>12544867</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267999200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/12544867/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/1/global_12986193.jpeg</photo_url></item>
