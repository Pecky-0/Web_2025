Brink some food to share with others, a water bottle, and energy! Invite your friends! We'll provide the music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main purpose of this meetup is to get to meet other salsaholics in an open area.  Sometimes it gets tough to talk to others in the clubs, so why not do it outdoors while getting your salsa fix in on none other than a Saturday?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The date is Saturday, August 19th, 1-5pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, we need your help on choosing a park! We're looking for a park with a nice area for dancing (a somewhat smooth concrete floor) that is t-accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please post any suggestions in the discussion board!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ana^3  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For map of location, visit: &lt;a href="http://www.harvardsquare.com/parking.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.harvardsqu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park is located on lower left corner&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana Masacote (manager)</member_name><member_id>2622923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>29</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.57999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1154625405000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salsa In The Park!</name><id>5059584</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156006800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/5059584/</event_url></item>
