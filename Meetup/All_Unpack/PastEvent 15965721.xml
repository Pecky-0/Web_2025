<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have a friend in town who likes to play and doesn't get to very often, so everyone is invited over for another come/leave when you want event.  There will be at least 2 of us ready to go all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not setting a dinner time for this.  My main course will be kept hot all day, just dig in when you want it.  Snacks and deserts will of course be eaten all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't seem to enable maybes for this event, so if you're a maybe, please post a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to bring (select all that apply ;)&lt;br /&gt;Games - We have plenty, but we don't have them all&lt;br /&gt;Food (non-snacks) - We can refrigerate or heat whatever you want to bring. I am going to cook a big batch of pasta and home made sauce.  I will try to convince my roommate to cook meetballs so both the vegetarians and the carnivores will be taken care of for once.&lt;br /&gt;Food (snacks) - If you bring it, it will probably get eaten.&lt;br /&gt;Drinks (non-alcoholic) - Sometimes everyone brings some; sometimes no one does. &amp;quot;You pay your dime you take your chances.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Drinks (alcoholic) - I'm not driving and we'll have plenty of room for those who want to crash, but we're not big drinkers ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;Chairs - We have a decent number of chairs, but if it's not too much trouble you may want to bring one. You can even bring them and leave them if you have any you want to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;Other - Bring anything you like as long as it doesn't get anyone in trouble with the law&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel/Parking:&lt;br /&gt;Parking - I live close to the beginning of the street, so at soon as you make the turn start looking for parking. Most of the parking in the area is resident only, but I will have parking permits by the front door for everyone to park on the street. We have a driveway but no car so I'm not shoveling it.  Enter at your own risk :)&lt;br /&gt;Train - we live 6-8 minute walk from the back exit of Alewife. Just walk away from the main road (the only one you can see from that exit) When you come to a fork in the trail take the middle one. Clay street is a strait shot from there. Turn left at Clay and we are on the left in a brown building.&lt;br /&gt;Bus - nearby is the 350, 77, 79, 83, 87, 88, 89&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you have any questions at all. Ben 617-997-3545&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have a gas stove/oven, a crockpot, a smallish microwave, and a fondue pot if you want to bring anything that needs heating up. Just give me a call to make arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Warmus</member_name><member_id>5401423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295917511000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294454619000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate good friends</name><id>15965721</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295719200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/15965721/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
