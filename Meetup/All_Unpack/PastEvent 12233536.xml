What a great way to get to know one another! There is a restaurant in Quincy that has great reviews, and is very accessible. Let's give it a shot, and see if this might be a regular event for our group! Check out the website, if you like (lapalomarestaurant.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaritas y nachos para todos!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I would expect that everyone pay their own bill. But I will call ahead to make the reservation, so PLEASE RSVP to make the reservation accurate. Since this is a dinner event, bring along family members or non-Spanish speaking friends if you want. My husband and daughter may be tagging along...they love Mexican!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell the receptionist you are with the Spanish speaking group under the name &amp;quot;Meaghen&amp;quot;. That way, everyone will be directed to the right table! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salud!&lt;br /&gt;Meaghen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263773653000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-955</urlname><id>1226919</id><group_lat>42.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>South Shore Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262734049000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at La Paloma!!!</name><id>12233536</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263600000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-955/events/12233536/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/f/global_7839023.jpeg</photo_url></item>
