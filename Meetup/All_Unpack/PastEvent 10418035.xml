In recent years Mark has become a thought leader on this subject, and has been in a couple dialogues with Ken Wilber as to how we can best manifest an Integral framework around our legal system.  &lt;b&gt;Whether you are a lawyer or non lawyer, laws and those who practice law effects lives no matter what we do. This presentation will apply the basic model of Integral Theory to the practice of law.&lt;/b&gt; Utilizing this approach, we will demonstrate itâ€™s usefulness in creating a more comprehensive practice and approach to legal problems. By creating a more comprehensive practice, the level of lawyer and client satisfaction will rise as a result. In addition, we will begin to explore the limited nature of the interpretative models currently relied on by our Courts; revealing in the process how an integral approach to interpretation is therefore a more whole and just approach to legal interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mark is currently an Assistant Professor of criminal justice at Plymouth State University in NH. He teaches primarily criminal procedure and ethics to undergraduate students. As a law student Mark and his partner Kimberly Houghton won the New England National Trial Law Competition. Before teaching, Mark practiced law as a NH Public Defender for three-and-a-half years representing indigent people accused of criminal acts. He also worked as Guardian Ad Litem representing the best interests of children in divorce cases. His principle mentor as an attorney in style and approach is trial attorney Gerry Spence (a teacher of his). After leaving the law Mark went out on a personal journey for a year and a half working in the Buddhist and Toltec traditions and upon return joined the Plymouth State University faculty. A conversation between Mark and Ken Wilber will soon be posted on Integral Naked.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much love,&lt;br /&gt;Ted &amp;amp; Nic&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ted</member_name><member_id>1467536</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole Trudel Churchill</member_name><member_id>3348175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255645836000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242391896000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Integral Law: An Exploration of its Meaning and Application, with Mark Fischler</name><id>10418035</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244157300000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/10418035/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/f/global_7098607.jpeg</photo_url></item>
