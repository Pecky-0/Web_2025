I wish we could have had the Meet - it would have been a huge lift from a gloomy day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meet is in a few weeks, May 6th.  As usual it will run from 1-4pm.  Once again, we're inviting Lisa Cutter to serve as our Dog Activity Director to run fun things for our dogs to do while we relax, chat, eat and watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, we will charge $10 for the Meet this time so that we can hire Lisa as well as buy the usual food and pay for the dog class ring rental!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you can come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maltese best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178644084000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176835650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May 6 Boston Maltese Meet, 1-4pm, Sudbury, MA</name><id>5680186</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178470800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/5680186/</event_url></item>
