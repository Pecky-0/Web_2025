William Dawes was the OTHER rider (you all know Paul Revere) that set out for Lexington on April 18, 1775. Dawes took an all land route so it is easier to follow his exact path (Revere rowed across the Charles River).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Government Center T stop between 9:00 &amp;amp; 9:20pm. Like Dawes, we will begin our adventure at 9:30pm at the site of Joseph Warren's house which is now buried under City Hall Plaza. We'll head down Tremont Street, onto Washington Street and into Roxbury and through Dudley Square, around Mission Hill and into Brookline Village. We'll follow Harvard Street through Brookline, into Allston and a slight departure from history as we take the footbridge over the Mass Pike. We then get back to Harvard Street through Lower Allston, over the JFK Bridge into Harvard Square and onto Mass. Ave. through Porter Square, Arlington (then Menotomy), and on to Lexington where we'll stop at the Hancock-Clarke House where John Hancock and Samuel Adams were staying and where Dawes met up with Revere. We'll then continue on toward Concord and end our run at Minuteman National Park where Dawes, Revere &amp;amp; Prescott (who had joined them at Lexington) were apprehended by the British. The route is just under 20 miles total and amazingly, we cover it in the same time Dawes did on his horse by running roughly 8:00/mile pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 'fun' run, not a race, so the pace is flexible depending on who is running. People are welcome to join in and peel off anywhere along the way on foot, bike or horse.&lt;br /&gt;We'll work out carpooling from the end depending on how many will be going all the way out to Minuteman because there is NOTHING out there at midnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find a map and a schedule at the TMIRCE message board:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/the-most-informal-running-club-ever?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;http://groups.google....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Who else will be at Government Center in their running gear at 9:30pm?!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael McHugh</member_name><member_id>1987659</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240347091000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233114346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The William Dawes Adventure Run</name><id>9617212</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240104600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/9617212/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
