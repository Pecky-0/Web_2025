Carrigain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday looks like an amazing weather day so lets get out there and hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Carrigain was named for Phillip Carrigain, NH Secretary of State (1805-10) and creator of one of the first maps of the state. On the summit there is an observation tower that affords one of the most spectacular views in all the Whites. To get to the summit we will take the Signal Ridge trail. The trail starts on the Sawyer River Road, 2 miles in from Rt 302.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must have traction devices for this hike. Due to limited daylight we will maintain a good steady pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** IMPORTANT NOTES *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is categorized as STRENUOUS and is not for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any changes or cancellations will be expressed to hikers that have RSVP'd &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; for this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please arrive early and be prepared to start at the designated time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions.
