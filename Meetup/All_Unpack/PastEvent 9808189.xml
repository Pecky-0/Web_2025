We want to give newcombers a no-pressure way of trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you must find a Certfied Belayer Buddy.  Then you are required to buy them beer (or other form of liquid refreshment) and munchies cuz they didn't have any fun while they were watching your undercarriage go up the wall.  The other option is to rent-a-belayer from Carabiners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2 - Second Time Climbers - If You're combing back, You MUST get certified - it's not fair to those who will have to belay for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3 - I can't think of a 3rd one yet but I know there’s something I’m forgetting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belayer Certification training is $29 ... $21 with student, military or teachers ID&lt;br /&gt;Tues BOGO (Buy One Get One Free)  $19 adult ... $14 student&lt;br /&gt;Rent-a-Belayer... $19 hr.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just Yodel !!!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236988512000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235440370000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Belayer Certification Training &amp; Climbing </name><id>9808189</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236722400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/9808189/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
