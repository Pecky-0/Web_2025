Chances are that there will be some tickets, but no one knows how many. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's up to you if you want to get there at 7 pm to put your name on the waiting list and see if you get a ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please update your RSVP accordingly&lt;/b&gt;. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.............................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is a Cabaret...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brown University is performing the musical &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Theatre/cabaret.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Cabaret&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; which is a blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liza Minelli made it famous with the film version, but it's been revamped and is way better onstage. Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6PlTBTq1qQ" target="_blank"&gt;clip &lt;/a&gt;with John Stamos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't know the story, it takes place in a seedy cabaret in pre-war Berlin. The story revolves around Sally Bowles, a dancer who is kicked out of the club, and falls in love with an American writer. The music has been redone, and it's amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Theatre/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="color: sienna"&gt;Brown Theatre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has general seating, so &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;please buy your ticket ahead of time through the Brown box office&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Adult tickets are $17, student tickets are $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 8 pm on Saturday, Feb. 28. Let's meet in the lobby of &lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Theatre/venues.htm#stuart" target="_blank"&gt;Stuart Theatre&lt;/a&gt; at 7:15 pm, so we can sit together. Free parking is available on the street and in campus lots on weekends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the play, we can go around the corner to &lt;a href="http://www.andreasri.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas &lt;/a&gt;on Thayer for Greek food. They're open until 2 am.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in lobby before show -- look for Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237073909000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228877803000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cabaret -- Brown Theatre</name><id>9312097</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235866500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/9312097/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_6574579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
