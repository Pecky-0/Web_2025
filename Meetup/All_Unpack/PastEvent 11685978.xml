I also have $3 vouchers each for small sodas and small popcorns (can be used towards a larger size). Exact change is very much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests are welcome, but please include them in your RSVP so that I know who/how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP as up-to-date as possible. And please call me if you're going to be late; if you need directions; or if you need to change your RSVP after I close RSVPs on the site (about an hour before we meet). I will email my cell number to all &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; RSVPs the day of the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll head to Fridays for food, drinks and conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256855976000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256222824000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paranormal Activity</name><id>11685978</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256682600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/11685978/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/7/global_11353831.jpeg</photo_url></item>
