&lt;p&gt;Come for a Winter cookout and campfire followed by indoor board games or just lively conversation. We will keep the menu simple due to the weather. Hot dogs and hamburgers, potato salad and chips, hot and cold drinks and S'mores for dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress warm and wear footwear suitable for snow. Bring shoes or slippers for indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a lawn chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will get the hot dogs. hambugers and rolls. A donation of $3 per person is suggested to offset the cost of the food. I will donate the hot and cold drinks and the potato salad. If you would like to bring something, munchies would be good, as would a dessert such as cookies that you can eat with your fingers. Please feel free to bring adult beverages if you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359907596000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357433135000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Cookout, Campfire and Board Games</name><id>98117912</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359837000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/98117912/</event_url></item>
