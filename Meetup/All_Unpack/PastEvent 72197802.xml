&lt;p&gt;Michelle suggested this Meetup. Thanks for activating, Michelle. I've procrastinated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll introduce ourselves and our situations, and see what follows. I'll bring a book I've used called "Organizing from the Inside Out" and say a few words about it as a conversation stimulator if we need one.Â I always hope for our members, including myself, to find buddies to help them get started and stay on track. I know I always learn something from the conversation. And usually have a few laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will last until we get kicked out or drift off. Usually our meetings last about 1.5 to 2 hours. They work best if we get there on time so everyone is in on the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've limited the RSVPs to 10 this time because the venue is small. There is a waiting list. You'll be emailed if someone cancels and then get a chance to RSVP. Members can bring a guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Michelle's original:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we should meet soon. People need the support of others. Summer is a great time to clean and do those jobs we dont want to do. THere is more time in the summer , the weather is beautiful (open those windows). We could meet at the library, a room in a building (church ect) a park. anywhere . Lets just do it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont know where you met in the past. I am new and just signed up.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Panera is in the RK shopping center that houses Hannaford.
