It is a gritty, contrasty, black and white, style of images. If you Google Film Noir you'll see a ton of movies that were filmed in this style - we want to spend the day creating images that reflect this style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone interested? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at the studio at 9:30 to discuss ideas and how to make the images. We'll need a few models, and we are looking for props like old dresses, hats, over coats, cigaret holders, anything that that would look good in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may need to chip in to pay a makeup artist/ hairstylist, but with models this is strictly a TFCD. If there is a MUA that wants to do TFCD- then sign them up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions should be directed to John B:  jbie@charter.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>11</waitlist_count><updated>1257779451000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253286911000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Film Noir Style Photo Shoot</name><id>11405759</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257606000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/11405759/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/4/global_10764420.jpeg</photo_url></item>
