Since detailed diagrams are presented, making a list of questions which arise while viewing is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people find it helpful to view all portions repeatedly, since these concepts are generally unknown and they understand better once they become familiar with the terminology and the history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Meetup adjourns at 9:00 PM. Please bring your own refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Get on I-93 from wherever you are. We are approx. half an hour north of Concord, NH. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get off on exit 22. At the end of the ramp go North on Rt. 127 (toward Gaza). In approx. 1.5 miles you will come to a stop sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn left, going North on Rt 132. Watch for mailbox number 298 on the right side of the road, approx. 1.5 mi. up. A tan building with semi-circular window is across the street, on the left side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go up the first driveway into the property, which has a Meetup sign at the end. Do NOT go up the second driveway which has a sign &amp;quot;ULCS Clinic&amp;quot;. No parking is allowed there, so if you get that far, turn around in that driveway and go back and up the first driveway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter through the front door, where you will see another Meetup sign. No need to knock. Just go on in and down the stairs and have a seat in the classroom. If you are arriving early for a private appointment, have a seat in the waiting room instead.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meetup sign at end of first driveway and on front door.
