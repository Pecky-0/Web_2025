Almy is one of the most vocal&lt;br /&gt;income tax supporters in state government. But she doesn't stop&lt;br /&gt;there. She likes lots of other taxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year her committee recommended, and she advocated, an&lt;br /&gt;estate tax and a capital gains tax. She's spent years searching&lt;br /&gt;for ways to raise taxes on Granite Staters. That she's&lt;br /&gt;organizing the summit is worrisome. That she deliberately kept&lt;br /&gt;it a secret because, she acknowledges, she didn't want the&lt;br /&gt;income tax information to get out, is troubling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almy claims that &amp;quot;If your impression of it is what the Union&lt;br /&gt;Leader editorial said, however, that is not going to be the&lt;br /&gt;subject matter.  We are looking for input on our current&lt;br /&gt;revenue structure as a whole, how it affects businesses'&lt;br /&gt;ability to grow and provide decent jobs for all segments of our&lt;br /&gt;citizenry, and whether businesses and NH economists and tax&lt;br /&gt;critics have suggestions for improvement.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN MEANWHILE CALL/WRITE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUSAN ALMY CONTACT INFO:&lt;br /&gt;Home Address:&lt;br /&gt;266 Poverty Lane Unit 4B&lt;br /&gt;Lebanon, NH 03766-2730&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (603)448-4769&lt;br /&gt;Email: susan.almy@comcast.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/committeedetails.aspx?code=H28" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.gencourt.s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TERIE NORELLI CONTACT INFO:&lt;br /&gt;Home Address:&lt;br /&gt;35 Middle Road&lt;br /&gt;Portsmouth, NH 03801-4802&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (603)436-2108&lt;br /&gt;Email: terie.norelli@leg.state.nh.us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/member.aspx?member=376154" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.gencourt.s...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This meeting is open to the public although we will not&lt;br /&gt;be allowed to ask questions or speak. We should at least plan&lt;br /&gt;to crowd the room to show our disdain for the mere&lt;br /&gt;consideration of ANY new taxes. Signs in the room will likely&lt;br /&gt;not be appropriate, but there is always the sidewalk for those&lt;br /&gt;who cannot fit inside.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256303803000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254961612000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NH State Tax Law</name><id>11576292</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256130000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/11576292/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/f/global_6800399.jpeg</photo_url></item>
