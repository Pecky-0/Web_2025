You have all heard of Enlightenment, and possibly have longed for it. But what is it, really, and how does one come into Enlightenment? Enlightenment means being filled with the Light of God in such a way that it has a deep and powerful impact on your whole being and on the way you live your life. So what is this Light and how can one find it? Come and learn the answers to these questions and find out how you can put your foot upon the Path to Enlightenment, in a real and meaningful way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;==========================================================&lt;br /&gt;This is part of a six-week class series called Meditation &amp;amp; Mysticism: Experiencing God Within Yourself. It is a powerful introductory course designed for those who are seeking an inner experience of God through meditation. Classes include teachings on the practices of the mystics and how they can be applied in the modern western world. Mysticism refers to &amp;quot;the practice of knowing the reality of God through direct experience.&amp;quot; It is certainly nothing new, as it has always been at the core of every religion and represents a more inner, experiential way of coming to know God and the spiritual world. We offer this series as an opportunity for you to discover whether the mystical path might be right for you. Time will be spent teaching the principles of meditation that will allow you to move deeper than the body, beyond thinking and emotions, and into the reality of God's peace and presence within. In each class we explore three areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Understanding the universe materially and spiritually, the Laws and Beings that govern it, and our roles as living, conscious humans in that cosmos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Spiritual exercises designed to help you develop skills needed for inner work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Hands-on experiences, through which you can learn to see, hear, and feel the spiritual world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome, no matter what your previous experience or religious background may be.&lt;br /&gt;The class is free, but RSVP is required. Late admittance may be permissible (after the first week of the class), but check with the organizer to be sure. Completion of this series can lead into more advanced classes for those who are interested.&lt;br /&gt;The class is offered on Tuesday evenings at 7:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
