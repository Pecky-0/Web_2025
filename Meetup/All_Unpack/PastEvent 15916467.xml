Our esteemed Fred Hapgood will lead the discussion with some thoughts that he will present to us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the non-obsessed members: &amp;quot;the hard problem&amp;quot; of consciousness refers to the problem of figuring out why we should sense/feel/experience anything at all, since any objective third person account of our brains only contains data-processing-like steps, not &amp;quot;feel like&amp;quot; steps. It's a deep unsolved problem that goes back to at least Descartes, but naturally we solve it every time we get together ;-). There is a vast literature on it (just Google and ye shall find) but it doesn't take an expert to discuss, just some real &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; thinking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet up in our usual roost: 5th floor conference room at 53 Bay State Road (BU campus)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Sean&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Enter side entrance, some up to 5th floor.
