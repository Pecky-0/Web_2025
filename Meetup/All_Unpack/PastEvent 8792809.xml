Delicious food, amazing music, and outstanding service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will dine family style, which means platters with a variety of tasty dishes will passed around the tables. The cost will be about $25 and includes; appetizers, soup, a fish and a seafood entree, a beef entree as well as a chicken and pork entree, soda, coffee, dessert, tip and tax. It may be possible to order from the standard menu as well. The menu details will be available on Friday. &lt;b&gt;Please let me know by 5:00 PM Friday September 26th if you want vegetarian fare.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thesunsetcafe.net/menus.html" target="_blank"&gt;Check out the Sunset Cafe menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendid=134080812&amp;amp;MyToken=7d236972-2517-46f4-a49e-b5bc4dd57dac" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the music of Receita de Samba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://portuguese.meetup.com/316/calendar/8792953/"&gt;The Portuguese Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt; will be joining us as well, so perhaps you'll pick up a few words. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before I list the Rules of Engagement please understand the NO-SHOW policy was established to ensure everyone who wants to join can and it has been fairly and strictly enforced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to assure you I do understand if you've RSVPd YES and you have a sudden change of plans because you're lost, you don't feel well, you have transportation issues, you don't have the money, or you just don't want to be around people. My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules for Engagement: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at 617 445-7549. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVPs are on a first come, first served basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO.
