Hopeville Pond is a widened three mile section of Pachaug River in
Griswold, Connecticut. It winds through woodland, farmland and areas
with light cottage development between a dam at the north end and a
section of the river connecting to Pachaug Pond at the south end.
Pachaug pond can be reached by paddling upstream on the river at the
south end and carrying around the dam." Description taken from AMC

Directions: Take Interstate 395 to exit 86 and take Route 201 South,
following signs for Hopeville Pond State Park. Stay on Route 201,
which forks to the right after about a half mile. (where Hopeville
Road goes off to the left); the park entrance is on the right one
mile past the fork. Go to Boat launch area: GPS N41 36 183 W071 55

locked), open it and drive in. Close gate behind you. There is a
small sign on the gate that says "only open for boat launch".
