It's been a while since we've met, so let's meet at my place to play a new game that I just got, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot.  The idea is to collect bunnies &amp;amp; carrots, while killing other people's bunnies with weapons like raisins and cheeseballs.  It's a lot of fun and very light-hearted;  if you're looking for a heavy strategic game like Settlers of Catan, this will not be for you.  But if you like laughing and being competitive while keeping a light tone, this is your game!  It's also quite condusive to talking and hopefully getting to know each other a bit better as well.  I've opened up room for 10; if you'd like to come but not play Killer Bunnies, that's fine too; I've got movies, other games, and we'll have munchies and do something for dinner.  So I hope many of you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's my place, so I'll be hard to miss.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian B.</member_name><member_id>4457375</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204582521000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Midwesterners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Midwesterners</urlname><id>545362</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ex-Midwesterners Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203991380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Kill Some Bunnies!</name><id>7408135</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204405200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Midwesterners/events/7408135/</event_url></item>
