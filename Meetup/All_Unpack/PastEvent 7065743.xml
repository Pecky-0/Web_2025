From their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of the 100th birthday of not one but two of the key creative figures of the Bugs Bunny universe we present this program of films that feature the brilliant Mel Blanc, the voice of Bugs Bunny and just about every other Looney Tunes character, and Michael Maltese, writer of some of the cleverest and most wickedly funny Looney Tunes including DUCK DODGERS and WHAT'S OPERA DOC?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this meetup I plan on collecting everyone afterwards. The Brattle's a small, low key venue, that should work fine. I'll be wearing my red meetup hat near the front of the theater. I'll also be wearing that hat while waiting for the film to start, so I'll be easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's always a good idea to buy tickets online, which you can do at &lt;a href="http://www.brattlefilm.org/brattlefilm/calendar.html#080216" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.brattlefil...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet afterwards - I'll be wearing my red meetup hat.
