So, in the spirit of light summer reading, here's our pick for June's meetup: &lt;b&gt;World War Z by Max Brooks&lt;/b&gt;. What does Z stand for, you ask? Why, Zombies, of course! This book is a fictional account of the aftermath of the World Wide Zombie War. I've read one of Brook's other books, The Zombie Survival Guide, and he's very good at blending an absurd premise with a documentary style of writing. So, hopefully, this book will follow along the same, entertaining path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be back up in Manchester in June at the Cotton, which I've been dying (no pun intended) to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the usual 12 person cap applies and remember to update your RSVP if it looks like you won't be able to attend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking foward to seeing everyone in June.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1277345339000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275356577000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let the summer reading begin!!!!</name><id>13651949</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277334000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/13651949/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
