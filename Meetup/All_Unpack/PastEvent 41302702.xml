&lt;p&gt;Neil found Milanos for Karaoke. Its your basic pizza place, but good pizza, chicken, seafood and prices and lots of singing and even dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a deceptively skinny little place, right at the merge of exit 6 &amp;amp; 7 in Nashua.&amp;nbsp; But the Karaoke is in a big function room in back where there's a nice dance floor and lots of tables!&amp;nbsp; He has a great sound system and every song!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a great pizza (it was 'greasy greek' style, but still really good) there and another guy, who had just had the fish, said they get the best FRESH fish delivered every week, especially the halibut that people even RESERVE at the holidays.&amp;nbsp; And there's a Bruins game, so $2 drafts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For parking, if you're coming from the highway, come exit 7. Then you can curb park right along Milanos.&amp;nbsp; You can't turn the corner onto Broad St, but you can reverse in the gas station, curb along the Broad St side. I think there is a parking lot just beyond that. Coming from downtown Nashua, just park along the cemetery. (they're very quiet - well its near Halloween ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
