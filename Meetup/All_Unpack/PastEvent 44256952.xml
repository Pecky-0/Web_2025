Riva will be hosting a totally Vegan &amp;amp; Gluten Free New Years Brunch at Rasoi. Rasoi is a delicious Indian restaurant located at 727 East Avenue in Pawtucket, RI 02860. The brunch will be served buffet style and the cost is $11.99 a person. The event will be held on Saturday, January 7th, 2012 at 12:30pm. Come see old friends and meet new friends! This is an open event, open to both members and non-members (as well as vegans and non-vegans alike). The celebration will also include some special holiday fun! Secret Santa! Anyone attending the event is encouraged to bring a wrapped &amp;#147;Secret Santa&amp;#148; gift valued at around $10.00. The gift can be something totally silly! Perhaps something you received as a holiday gift and would like to re gift? There is no need to purchase something (unless you would like to) this meant to be silly fun! In order to raise some additional funds for RIVA we are asking that those people who will be participating in &amp;#147;Secret Santa&amp;#148; to make a $2.00 donation to RIVA. Please RSVP for this event no later than January 1st, 2012 by calling 401-919-2058 or e-mailing RIVA@veganawareness.org You can also post on our Facebook event wall if you plan to attend and how many people will be attending. Rhode Island Vegan Awareness, the non-profit organization hosting the event, is dedicated to raising awareness about the benefits of a vegan diet and how it is one of the most powerful ways to reduce animal suffering and environmental devastation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326041624000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Vegetarian/Vegan Enthusiast</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood</urlname><id>1312890</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Vegetarian and Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323732624000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come Celebrate the New Year with Rhode Island Vegan Awareness!</name><id>44256952</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325957400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood/events/44256952/</event_url></item>
