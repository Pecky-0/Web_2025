It&amp;rsquo;s Not Just About The Taste! &lt;br /&gt;Transition Newburyport announces program series about Local Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning Sunday, March 13th at 4 PM at the First Parish Church of Newbury, 20 High Road, Newbury, MA &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Transition Newburyport announces the first of a series of programs about local food and its importance to our community. The programs will feature a speaker and a local food potluck dinner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;What can we as individuals and as a community do to strengthen and support our local food producers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Glenn Cook, owner of Cider Hill Farm in Amesbury, will be our first speaker and will provide an overview of the history and future of farming in our area. He will share what changes he has seen, and has had to make to adapt to these changes, in the 30+ years his family has owned the farm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Glenn, a member of the Northeast Harvest Steering Committee and of the Essex County Farm Bureau Board of Directors, President of the Essex County Fruit Growers Association, can provide a uniquely broad view of agricultural issues in our region. The mission of Northeast Harvest is &amp;ldquo;to help consumers discover, enjoy and support the farmers and local agriculture in Essex and Middlesex counties.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The program, which begins at 4 PM, at the First Parish Church of Newbury, 20 High Road, Newbury, will be followed at 5:30 PM by a zero-waste potluck dinner highlighting local food&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You are invited to bring a potluck dish using as many locally grown ingredients as possible from your garden, CSA, Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market, farmstand or local food artisan. Label your dish so we know what&amp;rsquo;s in it and who to thank. Also bring your beverage of choice: if it&amp;rsquo;s local and in a pitcher to share, even better. We will provide pitchers of refreshing local water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We are aiming for a zero-waste event, so please bring your own &amp;ldquo;mess kits&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; non-disposable plate, cup, utensils and cloth napkin. Leftover vegetable waste can be composted in the New Eden compost bins. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So come along, bring the family, your potluck dish, beverage of choice, &amp;ldquo;mess kit&amp;rdquo; and musical instruments. We&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to a fun time for all. &lt;br /&gt;This program is co-sponsored by Transition Newburyport, the New Eden Collaborative and the First Parish Church of Newbury.
