This month's event will be a meetup to see &amp;quot;American Gangster&amp;quot; with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe at AMC Loews Plainville on Wed. November 7th.  We will meet in the lobby around 7:30 for the 7:50 show.  I will be wearing a Red Sox pullover so you all can identify me.  Afterwards we can go for a quick bite for those who want to in order to discuss the film.  Hope you can make it and see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194653441000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191454630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hartford Area Film Discussion Group November Meetup</name><id>6482476</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194480000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/6482476/</event_url></item>
