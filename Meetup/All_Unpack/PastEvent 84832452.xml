&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greenfield, in the section called The Meadows, there is a nice trail that Stacy, Lucy, Apache, and I found which starts at the end of a street and goes to the Green River where there is a spectacular view of the mountains to the north east.  It is a nice well worn path through the woods.  It has a stop, which Lucy is investigating as seen in the picture above, that is a high ledge just at the edge of the Green River.  You cannot get down to the river at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am scheduling this now to beat the hunting season.  There are no signs posting No Trespassing so I have to assume that hunters can use this area during hunting season.  I also want to take advantage of the colorful fall season fast approaching.  The picture, taken today on Sept 30th, shows the leaves beginning to change.  We were able to hear and see different birds on our trek today.  It is an easy path and estimated length of time is less than an  hour.  Come see this beautiful spot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful of ticks as they are out in this area if you go off the path.  Protect yourself from mosquitos as well.  Meet at the end of Lunt Drive which is a roundabout.  The path starts there.  This is a residential area and dogs must be on leash until we get into the woods.  Please be respectful of other people's property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am limiting the size of this meetup since the parking area is small and I do not want to upset the people who live there.  Carpooling to reduce the number of vehicles will help allow more people to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions are from exit 26 on route 91 and head towards Route 2 WEST.  At the end of exit 26, there is a rotary.  Immediately look for the signs for Route 2 WEST to get off the rotary.  If coming from the North, take the 1st exit off the rotary. If coming from the South, it will be your 3rd exit off the rotary.  You will immediately come to an intersection with a traffic light, get into the right lane.  There is a MacDonalds, a Friendly's, and an Irving Gas Station.  Take the first right at these lights which is Colrain Road.  Continue on this road passing a 99 restaurant, Country Hyundai, Greenfield Community College, until you come to a Y.  Stay right at this Y which is now Plain Road.  Continue on this road for just under 2 miles.  Plain Road will turn into Green River Road after about 1.6 miles.  Lunt Drive will be on the right and is the 2nd street on the right after you get onto Plain Road.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michelle </member_name><member_id>34071322</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349711531000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349039482000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trek Through The Woods</name><id>84832452</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>5400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349530200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/84832452/</event_url></item>
