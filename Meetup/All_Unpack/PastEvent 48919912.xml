 &lt;br /&gt;

I am hoping some folks might be interested in joining me for the Fanfarlo show on Monday, March 5th. I love these guys! I would describe their sound as Arcade Fire meets Talking Heads. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Let's meet at 7:00PM in front of Sunset Grill (130 Brighton Ave). We can grab a table together and have a beverage before heading over to the show. I'll send an email a day or so before the show to reconfirm and provide my cell number to attendees. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Tickets are $15 in advance at the Box Office, or $20 through Ticketmaster. I believe the show sold out the last time they were in town. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 I hope to meet some of you on the 5th!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lee</member_name><member_id>6829924</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331085074000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327084958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fanfarlo @ Brighton Music Hall 3/5/12</name><id>48919912</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330992000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/48919912/</event_url></item>
