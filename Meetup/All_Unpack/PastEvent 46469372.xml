Heartbeat Friday is a First of it's kind in Connecticut! Permaculture based dance event collaboratively exploring sustainable health, agriculture and community. As we come together to share, dance and unwind we are surrounded in an environment that is conducive to perso&lt;span&gt;nal growth, awareness and healing. It is time we got together and discussed these topics that have been so frequently on our minds!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

*****Attention***** &lt;br /&gt;

This is a free event. save the money you would have used on a cover charge and buy some herbs, superfoods, organic food, smoothy, healing session and or anything else that will benefit your mind and body. Ohh yeh and there is a nice sauna here that can warm your winter bones up! Also a massage room, oxygen bar and an organic juice bar/cafe. I dont know what else you could ask for? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;*****Music***** &lt;br /&gt;

For now I have been playing fluuting grooves, hilight tribe, beats antique, shpongle and all sorts of good organic dance tunes. Please let me know if you have any musical talent to offer the event! We have a few drums here but would love to see real instruments pop out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;****Notes***** &lt;br /&gt;

This is a booze and drug free event. Take one evening and feel yourself in your original state, free of other spirits. With the right dance, medicines, foods and vibrations you can reach highs without the alcohol and drugs. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;*****Black Light***** &lt;br /&gt;

What do you know about black lights. We've got some string art, lycra installation and room for more. Come glowing and art showing!!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
