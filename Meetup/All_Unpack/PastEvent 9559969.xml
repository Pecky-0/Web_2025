Since it's something I have to watch for work but don't get for free, I figured why not enjoy the view of a hot waitress during my company's second biggest event of the year... The Royal Rumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bro-hood building mini-event. Attendence is NOT required but obviously encouraged to those in the area. Plus it gives some quality Hired-Gun targets to practice on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooters in Milford - 8 PM, Sunday the 25th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Please by Sunday morning so I know how big a table to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319645515000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232417648000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Small Social Gathering - Royal Rumble at Hooters, Milford</name><id>9559969</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232931600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/9559969/</event_url></item>
