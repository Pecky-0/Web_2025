During this rehearsal, we will practice the mechanics of performing in front of a live audience. We will go over the appropriate way to introduce our games, request suggestions, begin and end scenes, and transition to new games. We'll talk about performance etiquette and what to expect when performing in front of our audiences. A quick recap on some of the ideas covered during our Art of Improv discussion will work towards further unifying the group's attitude towards the improv frame of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulk of our rehearsal will, nonetheless, work on refining our facility with the variety of games we intend to perform. We will execute our usual repertoire of warmups and do the drillwork necessary to elevate our yes-anding and listening skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you next week!&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244076272000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239073028000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meeting 6: Pulling It Together</name><id>10132561</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239836400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/10132561/</event_url></item>
