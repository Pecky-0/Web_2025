Someone you're &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt; attracted to? Someone that totally "gets" you and accepts you just the way you are (without trying to fix, change, or turn you into someone you're not)? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then you're going to love this. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 You see, 2013 is just starting, and this is the perfect chance start fresh and go for what you really want. Would you like to get better results than you got last year? If so, then you need to give yourself the gift of learning better tools and strategies for attracting and keeping your ideal partner. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 In this unique event, you'll learn a proven system for attracting incredible new relationship prospects into your life anytime you want. This is the same system I use myself, and it's proven to be highly successful (not to mention easy and fun). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 HOW TO GET INVOLVED &lt;br /&gt;

 *************************************************  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Where is it?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;The seminar is conveniently located at the Watertown Center For Healing Arts. Please plan on arriving by 6:45pm so you have time to settle in and meet the other members. We start promptly at 7:00pm and go until 9:00pm (with a break in the middle).  There are plenty of bus lines that go to the center, and there is also lots of parking both on the street and in a big parking lot near the center.  The bottom of this page has details:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Why is it free?&lt;/strong&gt; Since it's the new year and I want to help as many people as possible, I decided to make this one free.  These seminars normally cost $20, but this one is on the house.  If you've been on the fence about coming to an event, now is your chance to see what we're all about with no risk on your part.  Come join us, and see what we're all about.  I'd love to meet you :) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Room rental contribution:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;There is just a 5 dollar contribution to help cover the cost of the room rental.  I don't mind giving the seminar for free, but I don't want to lose money on it either :)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;How big is the class?&lt;/strong&gt; Because we are going to be moving around, and doing some fun exercises, I have to limit this event to 50 people due to the size limitations of the room.  Be sure to put in your RSVP now in order to lock in your spot. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Please remember to bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great attitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a willingness to learn fun, new things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Go ahead and put in your RSVP right now in order to secure your spot.  I'm looking forward to seeing you there. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Warmly,   &lt;br /&gt;

 Jason &lt;br /&gt;
