Ain't nothin' but a party, and y'all are invited. Put that beat in your feet, fill that hole in your soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past seven years, The Chicken Slacks have developed a reputation as one of the funnest and funkiest club and private party acts in town. A skin-tight rhythm section (dubbed the &amp;quot;Engine Room&amp;quot;), gritty horns (&amp;quot;The Chicken Slacks Brass Attack&amp;quot;), and a stirring star vocalist (&amp;quot;Diamond D&amp;quot;) combine to create a powerful stage presence and big sound.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chicken Slacks play every Thursday night at The Cantab in Central Square, Cambridge, but this is a great chance to see them on a weekend and cut loose on the dance floor ... without worrying about Thinking at work the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is late notice but I really wanted to let everyone know about this great opportunity to see The Chicken Slacks and do some dancing.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to email me if you any questions about the show.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a Beer Advocate knit cap</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233018398000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-live-music</urlname><id>444171</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Live Music</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231125049000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chicken Slacks @ Johnny D's Uptown Restaurant &amp; Music Club</name><id>9445781</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231641900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-live-music/events/9445781/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/7/5/global_6848933.jpeg</photo_url></item>
