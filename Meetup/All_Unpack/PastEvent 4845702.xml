Come join us for a night of film and geek talk (what is google up to these days, vista, the apple phone and more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything with Warner Bros. Pictures worked out and I am holding a bunch of passes to see Firewall on the 6th of February (Monday).  After the film I was thinking that it would be great to head out for a bite to eat in Chinatown right behind the theater. This way we can get to know everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send exact meeting details as they become available.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brunswick</member_name><member_id>1794538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1139443557000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Technology Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>web-8</urlname><id>215777</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Computing Review Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1138851674000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night!
