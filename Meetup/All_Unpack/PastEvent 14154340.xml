We will start the hike at 9:25.  I'd suggest bringing &lt;u&gt;bug spray&lt;/u&gt;, a camera, binoculars, water and your &lt;u&gt;picnic lunch&lt;/u&gt; for after the walk.  There are restrooms at the visitor center.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be guiding the group on a gentle walk through a lovely wooded area.  We will take the yellow trail followed by red trail 2 to Battery Point.  The entire walk should be a little less than 4 miles total.  &lt;br /&gt;Here's a link for a colored trail map if you'd like to print it out in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usaaloft.com/audubon/images/MACMapColor.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.usaaloft.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will end our outing in a hay field where I'd love to do some bird watching with anyone who is interested. (I've spotted blue birds, phoebes, goldfinches, tree swallows and a baltimore oriole to name a few). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are interested, we can end our hike with a picnic lunch behind the Audubon Center and enjoy watching the birds at the nearby feeders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address of the Massabesic Audubon Center is 26 Audubon Way in Auburn, NH.  You should probably use mapquest or google maps to map out your route beforehand if you're not using a GPS- There are numerous options for driving here depending on where you're coming from.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link for the  Massabesic Audubon Center website: &lt;a href="http://www.newhampshireaudubon.org/center_masa.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newhampshi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting some of you and seeing others again. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in front of the visitor center across from the parking lot.
