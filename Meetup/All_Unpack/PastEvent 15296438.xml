I will be at the movie theater at 5:30.  We should try to head in for seats by 6.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love a good western, and they are far and few between these days.   Matt Damon as a cowboy...hmmm...wonder how that will work.   Course I confess to having a major crush on him...so I will watch him no matter what part he plays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group, come look for us after the movie. The group will gather outside the room where the movie has just been shown, to discuss the film, allow for restroom breaks and get a head count of all who are interested in heading to the Rockbottom for munchies, beverages and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picture is on the website, check it out so you can recognize me. I will be wearing a meetup pin and will also have a meetup sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the movie is playing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalators. If you get there before me, please grab a table. If it is playing downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: December 25, 2010 &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Paramount Pictures &lt;br /&gt;Director: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, Hailee Steinfeld &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Drama, Western &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross's (Hailee Steinfeld) father has been shot in cold blood by the coward Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), and she is determined to bring him to justice. Enlisting the help of a trigger-happy, drunken U.S. Marshal, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), she sets out with him -- over his objections -- to hunt down Chaney. Her father's blood demands that she pursue the criminal into Indian territory and find him before a Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) catches him and brings him back to Texas for the murder of another man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If movie is upstairs, I will be at a table near the windows at the top of the escalator.
