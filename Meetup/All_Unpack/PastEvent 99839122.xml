&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurants and events in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Kitchen Bar - on Hope Street in the Summit neighborhood of the East Side, across from Blaze.!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the story on this one is that owner Sammy Katsaras who had a pizza place next door for years jumped at the chance when the space next to it became available and created Kitchen Bar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchen Bar has become an instant favorite for neighbors living in the Summit neighborhood. The interior is elegantly done and definitely provides a cozy, contemporary feel. The bar area is large and complete with a bank of high top table seating across from it with regular seating in the main dining room. We'll have the whole bar and high top area reserved for just for us! If you haven't been yet, then here's your chance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where's the Summit neighborhood on the east side? Its the shopping area north of Thayer St (Brown University area) and south of Lippit Park (think summer farmer's market) on Hope Street. If you know where Seven Stars Bakery and the Rochambeau Library are on the East Side, you've got the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite places, its easy, comfortable and elegant all rolled into one, AND we had a great time last time! So let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Meetup. Ever. Except Hurricane Sandy and NYE 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
