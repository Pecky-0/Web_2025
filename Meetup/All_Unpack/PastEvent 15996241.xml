David Leon played John Lennon in the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the intimately distinctive setting of the Downtown Cabaret Theatre in Bridgeport, CT, &amp;quot;She Loves You&amp;quot; will be a unique Beatles experience different than all the other Beatles tribute bands of today. Ed Sullivan acts as the host of the show, guiding the audience through the various stages of life and musical success of the Beatles during the revolutionary 60's era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Via classic video footage from the original &amp;quot;Ed Sullivan Variety Show,&amp;quot; the audience will be taken back in time and guided through the 1960's &amp;quot;decade of love&amp;quot; set to a &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; musical performance of the world's greatest band, &amp;quot;The Beatles.&amp;quot; Let's take a trip back in time. Join The &amp;quot;Beatles&amp;quot; as they perform &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; on stage. Yea...Yea...Yea...And you know that can't be bad!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a fun way to spend the night...with a nostalgic walk back in time and good friends. We will get a table ...can bring our own food. Bring appetizers, or we can order out and have food delivered. This is a BYOB event...how's that for accommodation!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what you will need to do to purchase your ticket is call the box office directly (203-576-1636)...tell them you are with Terri Bruno's Meetup Group and want to be seated at her table. Once you have made your reservation, you MUST email me to let me know in order to ensure you will be seated with the group. BTW, tix are $39.50 and there is a $3.00 fee for making the reservation over the phone. Total is $42.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show will sell out quickly, so please act fast if you want to join us. Would love to have a great group together to celebrate The Beatles!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for  Terri or the Meetup Sign...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298181994000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>She Loves you...Yeah...Yeah...Yeah!!!!!!!!!!</why><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294688547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SHE LOVES YOU @ The Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport!</name><id>15996241</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298163600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/15996241/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/1/global_20731073.jpeg</photo_url></item>
