I was traveling the past days and just got back. On Friday, I'd like to do the Millipede trail in the Grater Road area, only this time in reverse (makes a whole new trail ;-) I'd say it's an very nice intermediate trail, with lots of turns, a few rocky parts here and there but mostly a smooth up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the parking lot (as shown on the map under Where?) can only be reached from the North. Also, the sign for Grater Road is somewhat hard to see at the intersection. You should also write down my cell phone # in case you're late or get lost: 848-448-6663.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on the trail,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christoph&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217859233000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mountain Bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mountainbikes-102</urlname><id>485750</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>New England MTB Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217512867000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Millipede trail in reverse (Grater Road area)</name><id>8447865</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217626200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mountainbikes-102/events/8447865/</event_url></item>
