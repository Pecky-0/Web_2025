I am the organizer for this meet up. The purpose of this meet is to create a space and time in our lives in order to meditate and feel the regeneration and life moving through us. I am a non- denominational mystical Christian priest. I have been meditating and teaching others to meditate for many years. Meditation is a tool to deeply connect with your Inner Self that the mystics would call the God Self. This meet up focuses on learning skills to concentrate and relax so a connection can be made with the 'still small voice' within. Quieting the mind can be difficult, but is very doable with some desire, consistency and effort.  A Mystic is one who gains knowledge from their own experience.  Meditation is one of the fundamental practices and tools of the mystic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace,  Rev Mary Francis at 617-990-7411&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.77</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1150002126000</created><lat>42.3199996948</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>1322</id><urlkey>meditation</urlkey><name>Meditation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1544</id><urlkey>peace</urlkey><name>Peace</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4417</id><urlkey>consciousness</urlkey><name>Consciousness</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10290</id><urlkey>spirituality</urlkey><name>Spirituality</name></topics_item></topics><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name><id>262460</id><members>257</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>3226320</member_id><name>Rev Mary Francis</name></organizer><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/c/b/600_13719115.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/c/b/highres_13719115.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>13719115</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/c/b/thumb_13719115.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Framingham</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/</link><lon>-71.4300003052</lon></item>
