<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Thanks again to all those who came and played together.  There were lots of old friends and even some new ones.  Many of you have expressed how nice it is to have a smaller meetup then many of the others in the area.  It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun.  We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and place in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this has not been strictly enforced at the meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donations will be accepted to help support this growing pug meetup!  These donations go toward paying the monthly dues to keep this website going so we can all see when the next meetup is taking place.  The money also helps pay for the drinks that are provided every month.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 2674662</member_name><member_id>2674662</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170360145000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1167505587000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Area Pug January Meetup</name><id>5353771</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1169920800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/5353771/</event_url></item>
