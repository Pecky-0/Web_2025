Because of Halloween, some people will be in costume - I'll be a pirate!  So come in costume or not either way - last year, I think only about 10 or 20% of people had costumes.  Here's the info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult night at Skateland in Bradford is Thursdays 7:30pm to 10:30pm. Admission is $7.00. If you don't have your own skates/blades, you can rent them for $3. Their website is &lt;a href="http://www.skateland.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skateland....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet there at 8pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the other rinks have restarted their adult nights now that summer is over. Beverly does Saturday night and Tyngsboro does Sunday night. But Bradford's owner (Marc) keeps the floor in spectacular condition and he does a nice job with the music so it's the best adult night in the area. There's usually a pretty good size crowd at Bradford.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John H</member_name><member_id>10366597</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288461987000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288185231000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bradford Adult Night Skate/Blade</name><id>15245656</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288310400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/15245656/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/8/global_1713624.jpeg</photo_url></item>
