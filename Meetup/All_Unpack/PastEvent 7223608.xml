Galehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will meet at the parking lot for the Beaver Brook Picnic area located on Route 3. &lt;br /&gt;the road to Galehead is Gale River Rd (FR25) and is at the intersection with Trudeau Rd. The intersection is called Five Corners. Less than a mile further on Rte 3 is a parking area for Beaver Brook Picnic Area on the south side of the rd. It is plowed and there is plenty of parking. There are also toilets and a trail sign there. &lt;br /&gt;    You will take the right most trail (Beaver Loop) south and basically stay south until you hit the road.. About a half mile in it comes very close to the road. There may even be a sign to the trails. If the trail turns sharp left you do not follow it back. The road should be just to your right.&lt;br /&gt;    Once on the road stay right at the fork and the trailhead will be on your left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have had record breaking snowfall here in New England. All hikers must prepare for full winter conditions. Pack extra warm clothing. We will be hiking in the treetops and brushing into the snowy branches. Traction and snowshoes are mandatory. Its still winter.  The only thing thats changed is that the days are getting longer. Thawing, melting, and refreezing will make the trails hard to predict&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the &lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/283/pages/disclaimer/"&gt;Disclaimer and things you must know. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane's cell phone is 603-477-5116&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a light greet escort sedan or grey Mazda van.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Milton</member_name><member_id>4294409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205849737000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><why>We always have a good time and we love to meetup.
