So we'll attend on opening night, when it's not quite so crowded. Let's gather at Nico Ristorante (417 Hanover St., www.NicoBoston.com) from 6:00-7:00, have a drink and get (re-)acquainted before we head for the feast. The restaurant is on the lower right-hand side of Hanover Street, just past Lucia and across from the fire station. Please check in with me when you get there. We'll enter the feast at the corner of Hanover and Fleet Streets at about 7:00. For those who haven't been before, North End Summer feasts feature Italian food (calamari, arancini, pizza, etc.), souvenir vendors, food samples, live music, games, religious symbols and great people watching. We'll start out together but you can branch off to pursue your interests at any time. For our after-party, we'll meet in the Feast's Beer Garden for a brew between 9:00-10:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further guidelines. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250551361000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249506654000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fisherman's Feast</name><id>11044560</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250204400000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/11044560/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/a/global_7834474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
