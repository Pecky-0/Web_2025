<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For those of you who have seen and heard John's band before, you know how great they are.  They feature all original music, with great songs, vocals, and some amazing solos on guitar, fiddle, mandolin, and pedal steel guitar.  Vincent's is a great place to hear this band - small, but intimiate, you'll have the opportunity to watch them up close and talk with the band members in between sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to hear anything but raves about this band.  You are guaranteed to have a great time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cover charge, but the band &amp;quot;passes the bucket&amp;quot; in between sets.  A $5 bill will get you an evening's worth of great music and fun.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222381358000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221425549000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The John Cate Band Live at Vincent's</name><id>8756802</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221958800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/8756802/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/c/global_5509084.jpeg</photo_url></item>
