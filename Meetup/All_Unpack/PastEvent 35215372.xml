New Yorkers don't visit the Statue of Liberty, San Franciscans only see the Golden Gate when commuting, and we New Englanders only travel to see foliage when we're driving our relatives from Lichtenstein for a tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A client of mine (a 500-acre hilltop resort in the Lakes Region of NH) is making their deck, with its stunning views of Lakes&amp;nbsp;Winnipesaukee and Winnisquam framed by the White Mountains,&amp;nbsp;available to us in between wedding events. We can shoot, stay for brunch, then head down to the lakes and surrounds for more shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/5/0/event_59334352.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;Because this spot is in high demand in the Fall for weddings, we're heading up on a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan on leaving the Seacoast Artists Association Gallery at 225 Water Street by 8:30AM to arrive at the resort around 10AM. We'll have the deck at our disposal (other guests excepted) for grand vistas of the lakes and mountains beyond. When we're tired of snapping we can grab brunch at the resort and, bellies full of eggs and heads full of Mimosas, head into town and to the lakes for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;101 to I-93 is the fastest route, but some (me me me!) may want to take the more picturesque Route 11 which adds a half hour in exchange for riding up the southwest side of Lake Winnipesaukee from Alton to Gilford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving by the lake will offer ideas for spots to revisit after the deck shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunrise Shoot&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

For those interested, a group of us will be meeting by 6:30AM at the southeastern end of Winnisquam Lake to shoot at sunrise. A&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://g.co/maps/7gejf"&gt;map with the location is located here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in front of the SAA Gallery, parking in the rear. If you're heading up alone, find us on the deck after 10AM.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>4289009</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319154465000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Photography Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastPhotographers</urlname><id>1528260</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast Photographers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317158410000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Foliage in the Lakes Region</name><id>35215372</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318768200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastPhotographers/events/35215372/</event_url></item>
