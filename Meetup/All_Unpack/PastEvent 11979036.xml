Herb Pearce is leading a workshop on this very important subject.  Here is a description of the event from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Meet others going thru loss, divorce, death of a loved one, including pets, sudden change, ending of a relationship or job. Learn ways to manage and cope more successfully with loss.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the workshop we might mingle at Herb’s or go to Starbuck’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264205142000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259562027000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dealing With Loss</name><id>11979036</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263600000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/11979036/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/e/0/global_3173088.jpeg</photo_url></item>
