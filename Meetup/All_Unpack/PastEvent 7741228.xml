I've seen this Minnesota band in concert 3 times previously and the show has always been great. They put on one of the more interesting shows you will see which includes live artists who will finish a painting that will be auctioned at the end of the set. You won't be disappointed to pay the $10 to get in.  If you can't make it to the show you should still check out this band - they are also trying to lead the revolution of &amp;quot;green bands&amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.cloudcult.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/cloudcult" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me a call if you decide to go to the show - 701-331-0920. We can all hang out at the show and maybe grab at drink after.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do you have to do on a Wednesday?&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Close to the Central T stop on the Redline</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Moeri</member_name><member_id>4913745</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208567061000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>This is one of my favorite bands to see live - they put on one of the more interesting shows you will see which includes live artists who will finish a painting that will be auctioned at the end of the set.</why><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208227421000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cloud Cult - Wednesday - Middle East Downstairs</name><id>7741228</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208394000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/7741228/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/d/global_2089277.jpeg</photo_url></item>
