The exposed brick, arched windows, 30ft high vaulted ceilings, and original wood beams in the front bar area make it one of the most impressive restaurant spaces in Connecticut, while the back dining room's combination of white-washed brick, warm fireplace, and handmade Amish farm tables make for a remarkable experience. The philosophy at the Firebox is simple; a belief that the best food travels the shortest distance from farm to table, that locally grown ingredients combined with classic technique and innovative thinking make for an enjoyable experience. Starting in July the Firebox will be part of a weekly farmer's market held on the grounds of the restaurant, showcasing the amazing farm products of Connecticut. As a chef, Jason Collin has made a solid commitment to utilize local products whenever possible, recognizing the marvelous natural wealth that the state has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RESERVATION  UNDER  SANDY</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy AKA Jeanine</member_name><member_id>5547282</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227308791000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226630125000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DINNER FOR 2008</name><id>9159592</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227135600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/9159592/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/0/global_2943360.jpeg</photo_url></item>
