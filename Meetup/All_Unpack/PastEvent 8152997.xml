He is real.  And He encompasses us with His protection, power, and love.  He has the power to heal you.  Nothing is impossible to Him, because He paid the price by His total sacrifice and surrender to the will of God, through His crucifixion and death on the cross.  If you want to know Jesus, you merely have to ask.  He wants nothing more than to free you from the burdens of your suffering, so that you, too can be one with your Creator.  Join us in this seminar, and began to grow a life-transforming releationship with Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Center of Light is located on the Orange line - Stonybrook T-stop.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221435718000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213638815000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Master Jesus:  God's Greatest Gift - a workshop with Father Peter Bowes</name><id>8152997</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221262200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/8152997/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/d/global_4477485.jpeg</photo_url></item>
