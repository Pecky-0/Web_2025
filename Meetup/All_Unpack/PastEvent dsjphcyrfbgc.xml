To grow old, become ill, and die is as much a part of our human nature as anything else. In fact, to truly live, we must be able to acknowledge and embrace all of this. This talk/discussion will delve into the meaning of life and death, and to move beyond these preconceived notions. Also, how is this connected with the experience of being unconditional recipients of boundless compassion and realizing the Pure Land? Inspired by a Tricycle Magazine article, The Path of Foolish Beings, written by the Shin teacher, Dr. Mark Unno. Presented by Daishin Senpai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer complimentary meditation lessons for those new to buddhism. Just arrive 15 min. before 10 a.m. and ask the person at the front desk for the mini lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
