Please rsvp, ok?  And, if you don't rsvp and want to show up last minute, please DO.  The more the merrier!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Maine Coffee Roasters in Falmouth for our (well, my..) first meetup; I hope it will be convenient for all.  It's close to 295 and the turnpike and there's lots of parking.  It's in the shopping plaza that has Staples as the anchor store.  And, if anyone wants to continue the meeting into lunch, O'Naturals and Ricetta's are in the same mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't want to charge anything, but I'll accept an optional donation of $1 to help cover my organizing fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound good?  I hope so!  I can't wait to meet you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my best,&lt;br /&gt;Kate&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>i'll wear a teal colored fleece hat</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate O'Neill</member_name><member_id>10631919</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258991044000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>MegaMagnets</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PLOAConnection</urlname><id>1426391</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Laws of Attraction Connection</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257368305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Law of Attraction Connection</name><id>11795748</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258817400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PLOAConnection/events/11795748/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/d/6/global_11327590.jpeg</photo_url></item>
