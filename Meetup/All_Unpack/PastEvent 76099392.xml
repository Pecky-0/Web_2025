The Waterfire viewing will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hour. Afterward, folks can head to the outdoor salsa event with live music a few blocks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More event detail can be found at the following link: &lt;a href="http://www.waterfire/"&gt;www.waterfire.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who plan to park at Providence Place - parking cost about $10 for 5-8 hours and does not have to be validated. However, you do have to prepay your parking stub before you get to your car and exit the lot. There are parking vending machines to pay your stub in the mall. And be warned that exiting can take a long time - sometimes half an hour or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation is your own responsibility, however if you need or want to carpool please post that on the comment page.   Our members are good about offering carpools.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Outside Uno Restaurant on Francis Street</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Warren</member_name><member_id>5756338</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Henry</member_name><member_id>7346155</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345418911000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343952445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterfire 2012</name><id>76099392</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345331700000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/76099392/</event_url></item>
