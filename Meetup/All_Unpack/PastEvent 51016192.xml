I know many of you are busy with Maine this week, so I'll wait until next week to promote it more. We chose a location that's a straight shot up I-89 so we could get as many NH folks up to the rally as possible. We need turnout, turnout, and turnout to show everybody how big a deal this is. We'll be driving media coverage this coming week and next. This is a big-tent event. Come hear Robin Koerner (Blue Republicans) and Chris Lawless talk about Ron Paul, and stay for the other groups too - we're building the future coalition here and focusing on accomplishing at least part of our agenda in the near term. Sign-waving will happen one hour before and after the event on the State House lawn. For today, please give our page (click-through, not this post) a 'Like' and RSVP to the event, to help build momentum. &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheRallyForRealChange" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.c...&lt;/a&gt; Oh, and the Vermont Primary is on March 6th. Open Primary, more delegates than NH.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329591008000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328373269000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Rally for Real Change (Vermont State House)</name><id>51016192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329584400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/51016192/</event_url></item>
