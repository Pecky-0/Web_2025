<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It was Columbus Day weekend so it just makes sense that we would choose Native American cuisine for this months cooking club. This one may take some thought and research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it though and you will realize that Native Americans have influenced our eating choices since the settlers first gave them disease-infected blankets and they handed us the dice.&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/shock.gif' border='0' alt='shock' /&gt; Native American’s cultivated crops but also gathered what grows naturally in American. They hunted small animals and fowl for meat (duck, fish, rabbit, and venison). Pine nuts are a staple of New Mexican indigenous peoples. Mushrooms, peppers, berries, flours, cactus these are all ingredients to consider. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be inspired by what nature offers and let your creativity go wild. You know the drill…&lt;br /&gt;Plan to assemble or cook on site unless your dish takes more than an hour to prepare. Bring any special equipment but I have standard kitchen tools and supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will use the back yard weather permitting, hope springs eternal.&lt;br /&gt;See you there! Thanks for being flexible on the date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;May the sun bring you new energy by day, may the moon softly restore you by night, may the rain wash away your worries, may the breeze blow new strength into your being. May you walk gently through the world and know its beauty all the days of your life.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apache blessing&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224720323000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221264540000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our very own Schemitzum revisited</name><id>8747021</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224284400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/8747021/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/1/global_5492977.jpeg</photo_url></item>
