I am looking to hold a meeting on Thursday, December 3rd at 7 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied for the Senior Center Lounge for our meeting (and all future meetings with luck) but have not heard back from them yet.  This announcement is just a heads up as to when we will next be meeting.  I will send a follow up message when the venue is set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to discuss the news about a viral/DNA marker that was found in Chronic Fatigue sufferers that was publicized two weeks ago and the possible ramification for Fibromyalgia afflictees.  It is a possibility that we have such a marker as well.  I think this is very significant information and I want to cover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as always bring your stories and support and any new information on treatments and techniques that you want to share with the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for an update on location for our next meeting and you can always e-mail me if you want to talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260057908000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256851807000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reading Fibromyalgia Support Group Meetup</name><id>11744643</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259884800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/11744643/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
