It was another great meeting, this time focusing on the NLP concept of Timelines, specifically the walking of them. In keeping with the spirit of NLP, rather than simply talking about it, we all walked our timelines from the present into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For June: We're going to continue on with the theme of 'changing the world with NLP'.  The sub-theme for June is 'changing belief systems' (you've got to believe you can change the world before you go out and do it).  We will discuss and then practice at least one NLP technique for changing beliefs (there are several).  As you can imagine, being able to change your mind (and keep the change, heh heh) is a _very_ useful skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June's NLP meetup does not depend on having attended any of the previous NLP meetups.  It also does not presuppose that you know anything about NLP.  Everyone is welcome, from beginners to experts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you.&lt;br /&gt;Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;Andover-Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
