Take a break from shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've purchased a Groupon for 2 hours of bowling for 6 people at NorthBowl in North Attleboro.  Last time we got thru 3 games&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.walnuthillbowl.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will cost $4.00 each for 2 hours of bowling with shoe rental and soft drinks.  Great deal !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet 12 noon grab something from the snack bar for lunch if interested while we bowl&lt;/p&gt;
