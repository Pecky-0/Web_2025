He asked that I cross-list this event so that he can get a big group together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day after day he bribed me by saying those who attend will eat dinner at the Bamboo Forest before the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I agreed, but mostly because I'm a huge Violent Femmes fan. Unfortunately, I will be out of town. But every time I look at that ugly moon, it will remind me of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let yourself go wild, like a blister in the sun! Meet Steve at the East Hartford Commuter Lot at 5:30 to carpool, so you don't have to be standin' on a corner, waitin' for a bus. You will have dinner upon arrival at the casino, followed by what will most likely be a great show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I'm immensely jealous already.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Shows at the Wolf Den are first come, first serve...no tickets, no cost.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he still needs a head count a couple of days prior to the event in order to make a reservation at Bamboo Forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Steve with any questions (hhhjkkk@yahoo.com; 860-655-8167).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf Den Schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mohegansun.com/entertainment/wolf_den.jsp?page=1#performerTop" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mohegansun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bamboo Forest at Mohegan Sun (menu link at the right of page): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mohegansun.com/dining/bamboo_forest.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mohegansun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1161034727000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1158189815000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Violent Femmes with Bamboo</name><id>5129191</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1160861400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/5129191/</event_url></item>
