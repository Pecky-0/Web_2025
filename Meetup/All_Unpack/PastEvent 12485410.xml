I am supposed to be getting six to ten inches of snow in my neck of the woods. I think I am not going to be able to make this event. Feel free to group up in the lobby, and head upstairs at 6:30 pm to wait in line for the doors to open up. You can tell the people handing out the tickets that you are with the Meetup group and want to hand tickets out to fello Nerd Fun people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to have to skip this one. It's going to be tough enough getting home in the traffic from Braintree, then shovelling my family then myself out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-T.J. Maher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the Museum of Science website&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mos.org/events_activities/lectures&amp;amp;d=4189" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mos.org/ev...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;: Cahners Theater&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You may not know Doug Roble's name, but you've probably seen his work. As creative director of software at the Academy Award®-winning visual effects studio Digital Domain, Roble developed the technologies used to create the visual effects in 2012 and many of Hollywood's most popular films. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Join us to hear about the technologies that have earned Roble two Academy Awards: a 3-D tracking software that helps artists determine where to fit graphics into images that have been filmed, and a fluid simulation system used to create the watery wonders of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and The Day After Tomorrow. Hear how Roble's software was integral to the success of these and many other blockbusters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Seating is limited. Seating passes are available to the general public in the Museum lobby beginning at 5:45 p.m. on the evening of the program; first come, first served. Museum members may reserve a limited number of seating passes in advance by calling between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday the week of the program only: 617-589-3169&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Museum of Science is going to put aside 20 Will Call tickets for T.J. Maher to pick up for our group. T.J. should be standing in the front lobby by 5:50 pm if you want to grab a ticket, or if you are a Museum of Science member, you can reserve your own tickets if you wish. Although the doors will not open until 6:45 pm for the general seating, by 6:30 pm they will allow a few of us to go upstairs and reserve seats for our group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alumni Highlight, Ohio State University: Doug Roble M.S.’87 and Ph.D. ’92, computer science and engineering&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://engineering.osu.edu/nie/article.php?e=803&amp;amp;s=5&amp;amp;a=2" target="_blank"&gt;http://engineering.os...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;When a 14-year-old Doug Roble saw “Star Wars” in 1977, he knew creating movie magic was what he wanted to do with the rest of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;What he never could have imagined, however, happened more than three decades after that childhood dream. Early this year, the computer science and engineering alumnus accepted his second award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, this time for developing a software tool that allows graphic artists in the movie industry to create surging water effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;His fluid simulator software was featured in 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,' 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; 'For a geek like me, this is the ultimate job,' says Roble, who is creative director of software for Digital Domain in Venice, Calif. 'You have impressive software engineers, mathematicians and creative people sitting next to fantastic artists, and they can take the tools you create anddo fabulous things with them'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This summer, Roble was honored once again by being invited to be a member of the visual effects branch of the academy, which requires members to have eight years of working in the industry and experience working in a supervisory role in the making of films, Roble explains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; 'It’s a very exclusive club, and it’s great fun participating in academy stuff with people I’ve heard about all my life. It’s the ultimate if you’re into movies, and I am very much into movies!' Roble says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;After receiving his doctorate from Ohio State, Roble was immediately hired by Digital Domain as a software engineer. He expanded on his dissertation work to develop the TRACK system for camera position calculation and scene reconstruction. It essentially helps artists analyze filmed images tobetter determine where to add graphics&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Digital Domain, according to Wikipedia:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Domain" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Digital Domain is a visual effects and animation company based in Venice, Los Angeles, California. The company is known for creating state-of-the-art digital imagery for feature films, television advertising, interactive visual media and the video game industry. Digital Domain also provides technical software solutions for the visual effects and animation industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] As of March 2009, Digital Domain has won seven Academy Awards: three for Best Visual Effects (Titanic, What Dreams May Come, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button); and four for Scientific and Technical Achievement for its proprietary technology—i.e., for Track (proprietary tracking software), for Nuke (proprietary compositing software), for Storm (proprietary volumetric renderer), and for its proprietary fluid simulation system.[11]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The company has also been nominated for three other Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects (Apollo 13, True Lies, I, Robot). In addition, its excellence in digital imagery and animation has earned Digital Domain multiple British Academy (BAFTA) Awards, and Prix Ars Electronica and Prix Pixel INA awards.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to be able to reserve your own ticket&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a member of The Museum of Science! &lt;a href="https://store.mos.org/index.php?action=memb_buy;c=1" target="_blank"&gt;https://store.mos.org...&lt;/a&gt; For $75.00 you and a friend or loved one, with a Basic 2 membership, can visit the museum an unlimited amount of times and their everchanging list of special exhibits.
