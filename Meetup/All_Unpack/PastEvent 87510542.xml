&lt;p&gt;A little more about the show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sinister con man Roat and two ex-convicts are about to meet their match. They have traced the location of a mysterious doll to the Greenwich Village apartment of Sam Hendrix and his blind wife Susy. Sam had apparently been persuaded by a strange woman to transport the doll across the Canadian border, not knowing that sewn inside were several grams of heroin. When the women is murdered the situation becomes more urgent. The con man and his accomplices through a clever deception convince Susy that the police have implicated Sam in the woman's murder, and the doll which she believes is the key to Sam's innocence is evidence. She refuses to reveal its location, and with the help of a young neighbor, figures out she is the victim of a bizarre charade. But when Roat kills his associates, a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues between the two. Susy knows the only way to play fair is by her rules, so when darkness falls she turns off all the lights leaving them both to maneuver in the dark until the game ends.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351954032000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350560691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Theater Night: Wait Until Dark</name><id>87510542</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351899000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/87510542/</event_url></item>
