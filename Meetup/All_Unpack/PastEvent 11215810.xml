In the words of the famous English playwriter William Congrev &amp;quot;Heaven hath no rage like a love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Time and again, She has left her foot prints on the pages of history.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She can be bold (Indira Gandhi), beautiful (Helen of Troy), brains (Mary Curie) and bi-ceps (Laila Ali :) )&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life is easy for men as all they are needed for is moving heavy objects and scaring away the cockroaches :) But a woman, She plays many roles in her life time and each role comes with its own unique blend of compassion, courgae, compromise and strength.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a tribute to this wonderful creation of the almighty, we invite all our desi-sisterns for an evening of fun, frolic, pampering and lots of chitting and chatting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You may call it a &amp;quot;Ladies Night&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Girls Night&amp;quot; or whatever. We call it &amp;quot;An evening by the women, for the women, of the women.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Men, you are not invited but then we know that you don't listen anyways. So if you wish to come, come at your own risk :) And ofcourse, we do not intend to take your chivarly away. &lt;br /&gt;So if you come, you will have to pick the check :)&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Venue is Cuchi Cuchi (Isn't that cute? ) at Central Square, Cambridge MA. Hope to see you all wonderful ladies there...:)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>lets get at Cuchi Cuchi after work, around 6ish</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amrita</member_name><member_id>9997290</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252670570000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251389279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Girls night out !!</name><id>11215810</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251928800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/11215810/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/1/global_10414385.jpeg</photo_url></item>
