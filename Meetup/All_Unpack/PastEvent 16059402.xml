Each attendee will be asked to speak about recent, local news, in Arabic of course.  The purpose of the discussion is to increase our volcabulary, comprehension and practice grammar.  Native speakers are encouraged to attend, correct us when necessary, and encourage our efforts. Appropriate topics include anything we may hear on local news that may may be familiar to the group.  For example, there was a blizzard last week. Lots of snow.  Funny news earns extra credit. I hope you will attend, but space is limited so RSVP soon. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Robin, who will be there to great you.  </how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296263910000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Arabic Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonArabic</urlname><id>1143990</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Area Arabic Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295116156000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and discussion in Arabic</name><id>16059402</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296259200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonArabic/events/16059402/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/d/global_12044205.jpeg</photo_url></item>
