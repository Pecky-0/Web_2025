It is highly recommended that you purchase your ticket beforehand on-line (the surcharge is only $1). Here's the link to buy your ticket: &lt;a href="https://tickets.landmarktheatres.com/Landmark.aspx?TheatreID=231" target="_blank"&gt;https://tickets.landm...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE SURE TO SELECT THE CORRECT DATE, MOVIE, and TIME- The site is good it only took me a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kendall has 3 Kiosks that look like ATM machines to the right of where you usually purchase the tickets. Slide your credit card in and you'll get your ticket and you won't have to wait in the long line and risk not getting a seat. I was at Kendall for a show last Sunday and it was MOBBED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I imagine many of us eagerly await a new release from the Coen Brothers. Not only is the wait over, but some consider this their best film to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mesmerizing thriller from writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?), based on the acclaimed novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning American master Cormac McCarthy. The drama begins when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a pickup truck surrounded by a sentry of dead men. A load of heroin and two million dollars in cash are still in the back. When Moss takes the money, he sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that not even the law?in the person of aging, disillusioned Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones)?can contain. As Moss tries to evade his pursuers?in particular a mysterious mastermind who flips coins for human lives (Javier Bardem)?the film simultaneously strips down the American crime drama and broadens its concerns to encompass themes as ancient as the Bible and as bloodily contemporary as this morning's headline. Co-starring Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald  Kendall Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to a complete review: &lt;a href="http://kylesmithonline.com/?p=603" target="_blank"&gt;http://kylesmithonlin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film, Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row and then its off to a local restaurant to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to this one - hope you can make it,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195642811000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193501591000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Coen Brothers- No Country For Old Men</name><id>6626813</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195420500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6626813/</event_url></item>
