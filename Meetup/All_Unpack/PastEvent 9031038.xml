A diverse landscape of rocky hills, meadows, wetlands, oak and hickory forests, quiet ponds, vernal pools, panoramic vistas and intriguing geological features distinguish this woodland. This range of habitat sustains a variety of wildlife including mammals such as coyote, fisher, red fox, and white tail deer. Reptiles and amphibians are also resident. Birds such as scarlet tanager, eastern bluebird, hawks and many neo-tropical migrants nest, find cover and food here. A wide variety of common and rare trees, shrubs, wildflowers and insects too numerous to mention make their home in the Fells and add to the biological diversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we will have lunch at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J J Grimsby &amp;amp; Co&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(781) 665-1123 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Lynn Fells Pkwy&lt;br /&gt;Melrose, MA 02176&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229798573000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224970690000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Middlesex Fells east</name><id>9031038</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227972600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9031038/</event_url></item>
