<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of doing a longer trip to warmer water with a short hop across from Niantic CT to the end of Long Island, NY with the Hamptons and Shelter Island. The water is warmer down there. We can do a combination of waterskiing and sight-seeing in the Hamptons and along the way.&amp;nbsp; If the ocean is calm, we could get away from the lake and river crowds that will likely be out this weekend. This is less than 2 hours away using the boat trailer to get to ramps close to any of this destination. If the seas are high, then stay in the bays around Newport, RI or South Western CT which are plenty big to keep out of other boater's way. I expect your share of gas and other expenses to be about $30.00.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>P</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter D</member_name><member_id>10327252</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310822300000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>It is finally summer</why><group><who>Waterskiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonWaterSkiEnthusiasts</urlname><id>1517227</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston WaterSki Enthusiasts</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304784452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salt Water WaterSkiing just a little south of our border.</name><id>17578873</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310817600000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWaterSkiEnthusiasts/events/17578873/</event_url></item>
