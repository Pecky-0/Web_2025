&lt;p&gt;As always, please bring a dish that can serve four people and be ready for great company, good food and a meaningful experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also know that people attend who are not in Meetup, so there are always more than those who RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>come to the upper porch</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340547310000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339860048000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>tasting medicinal teas</name><id>69439142</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340470800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/69439142/</event_url></item>
