I have two very sweet, funny rescues (since Aug/Jan - both young dogs) that are very bonded to each other, do well with other dogs. But, sometimes the &amp;quot;frenzy&amp;quot; of so many unleashed new dogs (at meet-ups) can visibly frustrate/ stress them.&lt;br /&gt;Wondering if anyone is interested in a slower introduction by going for a leashed pack walk? (that could happen on a perhaps on a monthly/whatever  basis if people are interested?)&lt;br /&gt;Willing to travel.............if this doesn't fly with the group - feel free to contact me directly if interested. I live in Hanover, MA and have some great locations for this. Thanks!
