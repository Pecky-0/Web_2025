<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! &lt;br /&gt;

For those who didn't hear, I'll be moving to Virgina for a new job at the end of this week, so it's my last week in CT. While I'm excited about the new job, I am also sad to be leaving so many terrific people behind. Thanks to the NHC, I've met many awesome people, some dear friends, and even my beautiful bride-to-be. :-) I'd like to spend my last night in town with the people who've brought so much to my life. I know this is short notice, and I apologize for that. So if you can't make it, that's ok, and I wish all of you the very best of luck with everything. But if you can, then I'll see you there! &lt;br /&gt;

-Neil &lt;br /&gt;
