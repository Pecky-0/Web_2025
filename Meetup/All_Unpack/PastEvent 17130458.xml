I am hoping parking is not too bad since April is the beginning of on-season for the Cliff Walk. Anyone in Providence who needs a ride, let me know. We can maybe carpool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cliff Walk along the eastern shore of Newport, RI is world famous as a public access walk that combines the natural beauty of the Newport shoreline with the architectural history of Newport's gilded age. Wildflowers, birds, geology ... all add to this delightful walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk runs 3.5 miles (7 miles round trip ~ 2.5 to 3 hr walk) and about half of the walk is in easy walking condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you walk further south you have to scramble from rock to rock and proper shoes are a must. Even with good shoes, fine sand on some of the rock surfaces can be very slippery. Half of the trail is paved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main things to watch for is Poison Ivy which grows well in rainy summer weather along some areas of the path. Just in case, be cautious and alert while on the walk. You may want to wear pants as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available at Newport's Easton's Beach (First Beach) and at parking meters on Memorial Boulevard. Cliff Terrace and Seaview are no-parking zones. The meters are a maximum 3 hr limit, which should be plenty of time for the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to bring water, and a snack if you get hungry during the walk. I'm bringing my camera :) Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Will send an email out if weather conditions have to cancel/reschedule this event. Also, attendees with RSVP Yes will receive an email with contact information in case you get lost or will be late.***&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Parking is available at Newport's Easton's Beach (First Beach) and at parking meters on Memorial Boulevard.
