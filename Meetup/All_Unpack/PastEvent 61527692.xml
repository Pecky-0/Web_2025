Conceived by Wagner as a prologue to the Ring cycle, Das Rheingold sets forth the dramatic issues that play out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in the three subsequent operas (shown later in the week).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gold from the depths of the Rhine River is stolen by the dwarf Alberich, who uses it to forge a ring that will give him unlimited power. The theft sets in motion a course of events that will eventually alter the order of the universe. Bryn Terfel as Wotan, lord of the gods, heads the cast. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcast is 2 hours and 50 minutes and I don't know if that includes intermissions. Hopefully there will be time to grab a drink afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to get advance tickets through Fandango.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me in the cinema after the screening</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Daniel</member_name><member_id>3074431</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336606864000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335023366000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Ring Cycle I, Das Rheingold: Opera at the Movies</name><id>61527692</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336602600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/61527692/</event_url></item>
