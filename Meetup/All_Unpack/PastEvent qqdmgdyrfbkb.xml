&lt;p&gt;Wallyball is the game of volleyball played in a racquetball court.  It is a fun, fast-paced game that provides the players with a great night of exercise and a whole lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can play volleyball, you can play wallyball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;every Thursday evening&lt;/span&gt; at Seacoast Sports Club on Greenleaf Avenue in Portsmouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wallyball is free for Seacoast Sports Club members and $&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;7 for non-members&lt;/span&gt; payable at the desk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $7 fee entitles you to full use of the locker rooms, saunas, steam rooms, etc. for the evening, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive 6:15 pm. Play generally will last until 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSVP EARLY in the week!!&lt;/strong&gt; Courts have to be reserved and games will be cancelled if a minimum # of players has not signed up.  As opposed to most other meetups, no-shows cause a real problem for this group. So please, if you sign up to play - show up. And if your plans change, BE SURE to change your RSVP Yes to NO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALWAYS CHECK THE MEETUP SITE&lt;/strong&gt; to see if the game is still on before heading out.&lt;/p&gt;
