We can shoot some pool and enjoy some drinks. The food and appetizers at this establishment are good. We can hang out for a few hours or for as long as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever can make it, please sign up. Unfortunately, during June this place is booked solid Friday through Sunday of each weekend due to APA Tournaments. If this date does not work, We will figure out a different time and/or place. Thanks to everyone for being involved with the group and &amp;quot;I think that we owe a big round of applause to our newest, bestest buddy, and big toe&amp;quot; Abdul!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sam</member_name><member_id>4195296</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279377757000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>5K-Runners-Meetup</urlname><id>1354697</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>5K Runners Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274241738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Abdul Appreciation Night</name><id>13527870</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279319400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/5K-Runners-Meetup/events/13527870/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/e/global_15142734.jpeg</photo_url></item>
