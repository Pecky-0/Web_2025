Up to 2 Guests per Member. Up to 14 attendees total. Ages 18+ (Anyone under 21 must be accompanied by an adult family member.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizers:&lt;/b&gt; Chandra (AO) and Susan (2009 AM)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadlines:&lt;/b&gt; The Final Deadline is 1pm on Friday June 12th. If people change their RSVPs to NO at the last minute then this event may be canceled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting is open to both those who own a kayak and anyone who would like to rent one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;People with their own Kayaks:&lt;/b&gt; If you have your own kayak, you need to bring your own PFD, paddle and a whistle for rescue. This is for your own safety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rentals:&lt;/b&gt; Paddles, PFDs and whistles are included.  I have confirmed with the owner that you do not need to reserve a kayak.  Kayaks are recreational and very user-friendly for beginners.  We are near the shoreline, so there is little wind and I have been assured by the owner that it is very safe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a snack/lunch and beverage. We can decide on where to stop to eat. No alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt; There is NO kayak instruction or lessons for this meetup from the organizers.  You should be familiar with kayaking and able to paddle on your own for 3 hours. SSFMG and its organizers are not responsible for any injuries to participants or damage to kayaks and/or kayak equipment. Personal flotation devices (PFDs) are required for all participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather Alternative:&lt;/b&gt; None. This event will be canceled if it is raining or too foggy. We will do our best to cancel at least 6 hours in advance but we cannot control Mother Nature so we will do our best to notify everyone at least 3 hours prior to the event. Please &lt;u&gt;do not change your RSVP&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;based on weather forecasts. We check weather forecasts the night before and use those to determine if the event is canceled. Check Friday night or Saturday morning to determine event status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpool: There is no carpool for this event. Members should meet at Nantucket Kayaks at &lt;u&gt;9:45&lt;/u&gt; am.  If you would like to carpool you may note where from in your RSVP comment and someone else may choose to contact you if they are also interested in carpooling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nantasketkayaks.com/location.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nantasketk...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Chandra has a red kayak and a silver SUV.
