Critics praised Stockett's skillful depiction of the ironies and hypocrisies that defined an era, without resorting to depressing or controversial clich&amp;#8730;©s. Rather, Stockett focuses on the fascinating and complex relationships between vastly different members of a household. Additionally, reviewers loved (and loathed) Stockett's three-dimensional characters—and cheered and hissed their favorites to the end. Several critics questioned Stockett's decision to use a heavy dialect solely for the black characters. Overall, however, The Help is a compassionate, original story, as well as an excellent choice for book groups. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will be easy to find us</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295572792000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>thatotherbookgroup</urlname><id>1149392</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>That Other Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287536029000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Help by Kathryn Stockett</name><id>15165644</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292544000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/thatotherbookgroup/events/15165644/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/3/0/global_18902352.jpeg</photo_url></item>
