Please join Jack Steadman of Smarter Travel Media and BostonPHP as we explore the ins-and-outs of running &amp;quot;consumer-grade&amp;quot; websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smarter Travel Media LLC operates two high-traffic PHP sites, SmarterTravel.com and BookingBuddy.com, which together serve millions of page views per week. SmarterTravel.com is a content site serving up travel deals and advice, while BookingBuddy.com provides a travel search tool for products like airfare, hotels, car rentals, and cruises. We'll take a look at the common platform that runs both sites, different as they may be, and many of the design decisions that were made to maximize performance as traffic scales upward. Many of the concepts will be familiar, but we'll touch on some of the details of Smarter Travel's implementation and some challenges faced along the way.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210372895000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207221483000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston PHP May Meeting</name><id>7664606</id><headcount>70</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210199400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/7664606/</event_url></item>
