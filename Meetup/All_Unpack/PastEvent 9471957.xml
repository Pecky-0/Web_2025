Friend. Lover. Unifier. Politician. Fighter. Icon. Inspiration. Hero. His life changed history, and his courage changed lives. In 1977, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in America. His victory was not just a victory for gay rights; he forged coalitions across the political spectrum. From senior citizens to union workers, Harvey Milk changed the very nature of what it means to be a fighter for human rights and became, before his untimely death in 1978, a hero for all Americans. Co-starring James Franco, Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna and Josh Brolin. Directed by Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, My Own Private Idaho) from an original screenplay by Dustin Lance Black.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7792036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232153890000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231374318000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Movie and Tapas-Waltham</name><id>9471957</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231542000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/9471957/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/2/2/global_6796642.jpeg</photo_url></item>
