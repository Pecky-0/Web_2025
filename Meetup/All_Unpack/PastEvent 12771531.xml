And she even beat JOE ! ! Even though Larry skunked them both.&lt;br /&gt;Micki couldn't find the yodeling pickle to sing to Joe for that  ^  ^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we had Laurie who was new but did already know how to play cribbage and enjoyed losing to both Dave and Micki  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all the usual wonderful people who always come and enjoy and always have F*U*N.  And kudos to Karen for taking over Gabe who lost to Micki also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emad celebrated his birthday early and got skunked by Micki - OH NO, anything but that...&lt;br /&gt;And Teresa who was her always gracious self and came up to the plate again filling in where needed (thank you always) !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big Thank You for the Coffee and especially scrumptious Chocolate Chip Cookies from the Cafe.  Unbelievably delicious!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the back room with our cribbage boards out !</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Micki E</member_name><member_id>4468648</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269990655000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cribbage Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WalthamCribbage</urlname><id>378600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Waltham Cribbage!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267642757000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waltham Cribbage - Have Fun Between the IDES and the IRISH !!</name><id>12771531</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268776800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WalthamCribbage/events/12771531/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/5/global_12747413.jpeg</photo_url></item>
