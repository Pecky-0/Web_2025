I have heard many positive things about it from meetup members, including Tom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cats of Mirikitani by Linda Hattendorf (2006, 76 min.). ?Make art, not war? is Jimmy Mirikitani's motto. This eighty-five-year-old Japanese American artist was born in Sacramento and raised in Hiroshima, but by 2001, lives on the streets of New York with the twin towers of the World Trade Center anchoring the horizon behind him. What begins as a simple vérité portrait of one homeless man becomes a rare document of daily life in New York in the months leading up to September 11. This is the story of losing ?home? on many levels. ?A profoundly gripping film, with a cumulative impact that may well wipe you out? (New York Magazine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater after the show. Then, we'll head off to a local cafe for lunch and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188311189000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185830362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Cats of Mirikitani -- A "Profoundly Gripping" Documentary at the MFA</name><id>6100130</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188137700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6100130/</event_url></item>
