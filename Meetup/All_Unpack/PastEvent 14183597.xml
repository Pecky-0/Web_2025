The Seacoast Photographers Group has been given the approval to lead a group through downtown Exeter.  Since we have had to postpone our Photo Safari until next month, we wanted to give everyone the opportunity to get in on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seacoast Photographers Group is another group here on Meetup.  I believe you need to register for the event, but I don't know if you have to become a member of that group to register.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're interested and plan to attend, please RSVP here and then go to the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastPhotographers/"&gt;Seacoast Photographers Group&lt;/a&gt; and see what it's all about.  There is a limit of 50 attendees for the walk.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Penny Savage</member_name><member_id>10532962</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Renae Dutile</member_name><member_id>12131424</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280064212000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ManchesterAUG</urlname><id>1532602</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester Adobe User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279830720000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PhotoWalk Tour ... </name><id>14183597</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279978200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ManchesterAUG/events/14183597/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/7/global_15579559.jpeg</photo_url></item>
