The two-mile-long lake and Weir Hill (&amp;quot;wire hill&amp;quot;) are the dominant natural features in the northeast part of town and easily its most scenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to bring &lt;br /&gt;Wear hiking boots, as a small portion of the trail will be steep. &lt;br /&gt;Water and a snack are also a good idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Hike &lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;THERE ARE NO RESTROOMS ON SITE&lt;/u&gt;, so leave enough time to stop before the hike! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will leave promptly at 9:40. The hike will be about 3 to 3.5 miles. We will follow the Edgewood Farm Trail to reach the meandering shore of Lake Cochichewick, which dominates the east and south edges of this reservation. We will then follow the lake shoreline to Stevens Pond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last stretch of the hike, we will take Stevens Trail up the spine of Weir Hill to where a scenic overlook opens on the left. Enjoy a broad panorama of the Merrimack Valley spreading below. On days of good visibility, you can see Mount Wachusett rising in the distance beyond Worcester, and northwest of Wachusett, New Hampshire's Mount Monadnock. (I must admit that the view is a little better when the leaves on the trees are gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Hike &lt;br /&gt;I thought we might go out for lunch in the area. Fudruckers or Panera Bread are good options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trails/Landscape &lt;br /&gt;Four miles of trails, easy to moderate hiking, strenuous in places. &lt;br /&gt;Generations of agricultural use, a history of fire, and cutting and mowing regimes have created a patchwork landscape on Weir Hill that supports ten different types of plant communities, from a 60-acre oak-hickory forest to hillside seeps, intermittent streams, and wet meadows. Several threatened state-listed and watch-listed species can be found on Weir Hill, including the white bog orchid (Habenaria dilitata), violet bush clover (Lespedeza violacea), butternut trees (Juglans nigra), although we have not yet seen any of these. &lt;br /&gt;If you want to learn more about Weir Hill, including its history, or to print out a trail map, here's the link: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/places-to-visit/northeast-ma/weir-hill.html#t1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetrustee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions &lt;br /&gt;If you type any address between 54 and 90 Stevens Street in North Andover in to your GPS, this should work. When I used street view, I could see the trail head at &lt;u&gt;62 Stevens Street&lt;/u&gt;. Park on the side of the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From I-93 Exit 41, take Rt. 125 North 7.3 mi.
