It's fast becoming THE place to shop for the work of the South End's well-known artist's community.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOWA hosts a wide variety of vendors and artists who sell everything from hand-crafted accessories, original art, indie designer clothing or just a fresh loaf of bread.  You'll also find painters, sculptors, photographers, clothing and jewelry designers, milliners, handbag designers, house wares, florists, bakers, local farmer's produce and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It promises to be a unique photo-taking opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the morning when the market first opens and then find a place for lunch for those of you who want to stick around.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location close to Rte 93 with free parking just up the street from the market at 500 Harrison Ave.  It's also accessible via the T (Orange Line to the Mass Ave busline -- about 10 minutes from the station then a short walk down Harrison Ave.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP your fingers crossed for one of those glorious sunny fall days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there...
