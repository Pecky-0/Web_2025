Here are the details of the November meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a reminder: we start the meeting at 6:30 for those new to NLP, those who want a review, and those who want to come early to socialize/network.  At 7pm we will jump into the main event for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main event: Logical Level Alignment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as we say &amp;quot;the stars are aligned&amp;quot; when everything seems to be going our way, when WE are aligned internally and externally, our goals become much more attainable.  Robert Dilts, one of the early NLP pioneers, came up with this powerful pattern which aligns us on 6 levels: Environment, behavior, capabilities, beliefs/values, identity, and spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to work on specific issues you are having that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;We meet on the first floor of Sturtevant Hall, 197 Herrick Road, which is near the library on the central quad of Andover Newton. &lt;br /&gt;Andover Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
