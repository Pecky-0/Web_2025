The properties will be on view from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Ticket prices are $20 in advance ($25 the day of the tour). Members of the Manchester Historic Association receive a $5 discount. Children 12 and under are admitted free. All proceeds will benefit the efforts of the Association to collect, preserve and share Manchester’s history. To purchase tickets, call the Association at (603) 622-7531, or visit the Millyard Museum at 200 Bedford Street, open Wednesday through Saturday, 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On view will be five distinctive homes: the Frank Pierce Carpenter House at 1800 Elm Street; the Charles H. Manning House at 1838 Elm Street; the Samantha Plantin House at 363 Concord Street; the John Andrews House at 113 Bay Street; and the Campbell-Stark House at 585 Belmont Street. The homes on the tour represent a variety of distinctive Victorian-era architectural styles, and each property has stories to tell about the people who lived in it. The event will also include guided tours of the Manchester Masonic Temple at 1505 Elm Street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Participants will be provided with historical information about the properties on the tour. They will learn about leaders of Victorian Manchester, including the successful businessman Frank Carpenter, who gave the city it’s beautiful public library building; and Charles Manning, an engineer and inventor who worked for the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. They will also learn about Samantha Plantin, an African American woman who found opportunity in this bustling industrial city. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The Historic Architecture of Manchester Tour is made possible through the generosity of the property owners, and through numerous volunteers. The event is sponsored by two Manchester businesses that are actively engaged in historic preservation work: Bill’s Roofing and R. Therrien &amp;amp; Son (interior and exterior painting).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Manchester Historic Association</member_name><member_id>10139829</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1339270077000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>History fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-History-Network</urlname><id>1505455</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester History Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250173362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Historic Architecture of Manchester Tour: Hidden Treasures in Full View </name><id>11103070</id><headcount>150</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254675600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-History-Network/events/11103070/</event_url></item>
