Mist (2,220) and ending at NH 25 in Glencliff (just west of Mt.Mooseilauke). This is the last easy hiking that thru-hikers experience before reaching the White Mountains and Southern Maine. The terrain consists of rolling hills and several moderate ascents and descents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is likely that we will encounter some snow, ice, or mud along the route, so gaiters, waterproof footwear, and additional traction are recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trip will begin on Sunday morning, May 3 at 9:00 AM at the trailhead on NH 25 in Glenncliff, NH. We will run shuttles to the AT parking lot on Atwell Rd and start our hike. The trip ends after we reach NH 25 and run the reverse shuttle to Atwell Rd. to pick up our other car(s). Please be prompt. Once we run our shuttle, weâ€™ll be gone for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://mt3.google.com/mt/v=app.87&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;x=1229&amp;amp;y=1489&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;s=" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to NH 25 in Glencliff from Boston:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I93 North 109 miles. Take exit 26 for US-3/Hwy 3A/RT-25 toward Rumney/Plymouth 0.4 miles. Merge onto RT-3A 3.9 miles. At the traffic circle, take the 1st exit onto RT-25/Rumney Route 25 Continue to follow RT-25 20.2 miles. The AT crosses NH 25 about 0.5 mile north of Glencliff. There is a large dirt parking area at the trail crossing. It will be on the left coming from Glencliff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a limit of 12 on this trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is moderate hike, but in the best interests of all, I reserve the right to decline RSVPs if I do think you will be a good fit. On the other hand, everyone should realize this is a group hike and we will work together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance: 8 miles&lt;br /&gt;Elevation: 2,000 ft&lt;br /&gt;Trails: Appalachian Trail, New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your rsvp's up to date.
