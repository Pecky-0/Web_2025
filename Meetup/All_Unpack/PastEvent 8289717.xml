In the Summer when it's cool and contrast is high you can see car headlights from far away, the cooler night air feel great and there are fewer cars on the road. Weather as of this writing is expected to be in the low 70's and partly cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ride will start in Concord and head up to Kimball's in Westford for a little ice cream and hanging out, then head up 119 to Jaffery NH for a pit stop and then an about face returning to Concord. Ride time (not including to and from Concord) about 2.5 hours (90 Miles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members departing from the Boston area to meet at the Marriott Hotel at 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speeds will be in the 40-50 range, best for Scooters in the 250cc and up range.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Scooters</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217812198000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215403207000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Big Iron: Night Ride</name><id>8289717</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217638800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/8289717/</event_url></item>
