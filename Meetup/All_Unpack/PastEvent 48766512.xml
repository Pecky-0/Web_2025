 &lt;br /&gt;

 We read and discuss most any genre of non-fiction including, biography, memoir, history, science, politics, nature, the arts, cooking, travel, current affairs, interpersonal relations... you name it. Our goal is to learn about all sorts of new ideas, things, trends, and cultures - and to make new friends in the process. The only ground rules are that everyone is at all times respectful of the ideas and opinions of others, and that everyone be conscious of allowing others time to speak.  &lt;em&gt;Be nice. Be brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;This Month's Selection:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Account: &lt;em&gt;Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's&lt;/em&gt; Relacion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annotated Translation by Martin Favata &amp;amp; Jose Fernandez&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Jan 1993, 121pp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ISBN: 1-55885-060-0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/a/4/event_122412452.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;This is the memoir of a Spanish explorer from the 16th century named Alvar Nunez 'Cabeza de Vaca'. (His name means &lt;em&gt;cow's head&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was part of a Spanish voyage of conquest that went terribly awry on the coast of what is now Florida. Cabeza de Vaca survived while most of his shipmates perished in one way or another. He then began a years-long journey across North America, describing the people and places he encountered along the way. At various times he became a leader, a slave, a shaman, and simply a starving man in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His account (and this translation) is remarkably clear and easy to read by modern standards. And it's fairly short at 121 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Account&lt;/strong&gt; edited and translated by José Fernández and Martin Favata, is an improved translation of Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca’s chronicle of his amazing journey across a large portion of what is now the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is one of the earliest chronicles&lt;/strong&gt; of Spanish penetration into North America. His journey (1528-1536) of hardship and misfortune is one of the most remarkable in the history of the New World and contains many first descriptions of the lands and their inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1528&lt;/strong&gt;, a mission set out from Spain to colonize Florida. But the expedition went horribly wrong: Delayed by a hurricane, knocked off course by a colossal error of navigation, and ultimately doomed by a disastrous decision to separate the men from their ships, the mission quickly became a desperate journey of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of the three hundred men&lt;/strong&gt; who had embarked on the journey, only four survived—three Spaniards and an African slave. This tiny band endured a horrific march through Florida, a harrowing raft passage across the Louisiana coast, and years of enslavement in the American Southwest. They journeyed for almost ten years in search of the Pacific Ocean that would guide them home, and they were forever changed by their experience. The men lived with a variety of nomadic Indians and learned several indigenous languages. They saw lands, peoples, plants, and animals that no outsider had ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First published&lt;/strong&gt; in Zamora, Spain, in 1542, the book is of inestimable value for students of history and literature, ethnographers, anthropologists and the general reader. It is also one of the most remarkable literary documents for the style, clarity and sense of drama in the narrator’s extraordinary effort to comprehend a totally new and marvelous world.&lt;/p&gt;
