Meet in the table area at 6:45. &lt;br /&gt;Trivia Buff includes 4 &amp;quot;semesters,&amp;quot; each with 4 questions that you allocate a number of points to. There is also a 'name-that-tune' portion as well as additional bonus questions. Categories range from movies to sports to science. &lt;br /&gt;There can be up to 6 people on a team. Depending on how many people show up we will make multiple teams. &lt;br /&gt;Bayside Lounge has a full bar and reasonable drink prices. They now have food available, also at reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are on a roll and have won the last 3 times we've played; join our winning team! Hope to see you there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for me in the table area</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281145833000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279215975000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia at the Bayside Lounge in Fairhaven </name><id>14112621</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281048300000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/14112621/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
