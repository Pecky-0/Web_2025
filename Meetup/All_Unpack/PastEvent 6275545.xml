The rally runs from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM and will feature a speech by Dr. Paul, as well as live music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately following the rally, the campaign will distribute literature and canvassing packets and teams will proceed to canvass the cities of Manchester and Nashua. Dr. Paul and more than thirty members of his family will be in attendance and we expect to have a lot of fun spreading the message of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Please bring an umbrella or poncho in case of rain.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191250888000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188574183000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul NH Family Walk</name><id>6275545</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191072600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6275545/</event_url></item>
