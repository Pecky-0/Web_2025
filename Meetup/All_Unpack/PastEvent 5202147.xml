Approx. 3 miles total.  This trail has a lot of hills and valleys, so be prepared for a leg workout!  There are many great views of the lake along the way.  You'll also see an old foundation, the old &amp;quot;rope swing&amp;quot;, and a couple &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; beaches!  The trail begins at the end of Great Quarter Rd in Newtown and we will be taking it to a natural waterfall.  There is a perfect picnic spot at the waterfall, so feel free to pack a sandwich or something to much on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************************Just some last minute details***********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Quarter Rd is located right off of Route 34 near the junction of 111 and 34.  Take Great Quarter Rd until it is a dead end. I'll be there early in a dark grey Honda, I'll try to put some sort of &amp;quot;sign&amp;quot; on it to eliminate confusion ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel that you are going to arrive after 1:00, please call my cell phone (listed below) so that I know to wait for you.  Also call if you have ANY questions or concerns.  See you out there!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda (203) 209-7779&lt;br /&gt;backup cell phone (203) 515-3428&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1162317730000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1161027350000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Waterfall Hike at Lake Zoar</name><id>5202147</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1162144800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5202147/</event_url></item>
