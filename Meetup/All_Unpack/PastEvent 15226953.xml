Do you have an abundance of grape jam but no pickles or  preserved tomatoes? Too much sour dough starter but no vegetable seeds? Too many sauce pans but no fresh herbs? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then join us for our first community trading event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Basics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swap will start at 1:00 and continue until 3:00.&lt;br /&gt;This will be a true bartering event with no cash exchanges. &lt;br /&gt;Please bring items that you believe others would value.&lt;br /&gt;Please label any food items with your name, ingredients and date.&lt;br /&gt;Clothing and household items are welcome but you must take home what you don't trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of this meetup will depend on a good number of participants. So spread the&lt;br /&gt;word to your friends in the area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please do NOT park in numbered spaces.
