Everyone is invited to a party at my house in Wakefield.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone can drop in any time after 5-ish.  If you want to come earlier, that's fine too!  I'll cook a turkey to pick at, and we could all bring some favorite covered dish and/or beverages.  Maybe we could watch classic holiday movies or just hang out and laugh.  If you wear a really ugly holiday sweater you might win a prize!  Any good ideas?  Post them on the message board!  None of us have to be alone when we can share this day with a jolly group of friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;debbie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>:Debbie</member_name><member_id>3498559</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198793329000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197826157000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christmas Open House</name><id>6921749</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198620000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6921749/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/4/global_2851572.jpeg</photo_url></item>
