<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>So far, we have primarily focused on the technical approach to trading. This month we will look at the fundamental approach followed by the CANSLIM method. It would be helpful if each member can select ONE stock symbol to be discussed during the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and to the right (the Peace Dale Room). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so  if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy working the laptop &amp; projector set up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raymond Dreczko</member_name><member_id>4521820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209161392000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>IBD Enthusiasts and Traders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ibd-739</urlname><id>559772</id><group_lat>41.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205968341000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum April Meeting</name><id>7565758</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208988000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ibd-739/events/7565758/</event_url></item>
