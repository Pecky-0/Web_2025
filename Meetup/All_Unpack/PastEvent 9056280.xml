We'll meet just inside the entrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For information on directions and parking, please check the venue website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 28 years the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (SMFA) has hosted the annual December Sale, an art sale and fundraiser for student scholarships. Featuring work by hundreds of established and emerging artists each year—including internationally known SMFA alumni and faculty, current students, and affiliated artists—the Sale has become the largest public art sale in New England, grossing over $1.1 million in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the event has become an important program of the School, its name has never fully represented what we are about: fostering the education of artists through creative investigation, risk-taking, and individual vision. Nor has its name conveyed the dynamic interchange the Sale has encouraged and promoted between the School's community of artists and the public at large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reflect this and to expand our presence in the New England arts community, we are pleased to announce a new name and new dates for our annual event: InsideOut: The Museum School Art Sale, November 19–23, 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new name supports the Museum School's efforts to distinguish itself within the New England arts community and beyond. We hope the new name will pique the interest of individuals who are unfamiliar with the School as well as our dedicated supporters. InsideOut will continue to offer the largest and most diverse range of the fine arts under one roof - and will include a full representation of media taught here, from painting, drawing, and sculpture to video and performance art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are a budding or experienced art collector, aspire to participate in the development of a young artist's career, or are simply curious about the School, we welcome you to explore InsideOut.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a purple flower pin.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cristin</member_name><member_id>603739</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228597050000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225311702000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Inside Out: The Museum School Art Sale</name><id>9056280</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227373200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/9056280/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/b/global_6091979.jpeg</photo_url></item>
