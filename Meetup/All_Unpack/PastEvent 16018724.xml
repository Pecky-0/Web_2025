I first started the Couch to 5K in 2009 and stopped running due to an unrelated injury.  After starting up again in 2010, finishing in almost a dozen 5k's, a 10K and starting my training for a 1/2 marathon, I was accepted to join Mass Eye and Ear's fund raising team for the 2011 Boston Marathon.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't think you can run, THINK AGAIN!  If I can get where I am, then anyone can follow this program at their own pace to run, jog or &amp;quot;wog&amp;quot; a 5K.  :)  We have so many graduates already and I'd love to see more.  Please invite your friends to join us!    Having a group to train with is part of the success.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who missed out, last summer we met twice a week at the track to train for 5K events. We had walkers join us and cheer us on and more experienced runners who gave us inspiration.  After months of meeting at the track, I met some great people and made some wonderful friendships.  The support and encouragement of doing this with a group is so amazing!   Time at the track became something I looked forward to and really miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking get in some time to walk, want to train with us, or are runner of your own, please join us every and any Monday and Wednesday night at BHS.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get everyone ready for a 5K, event we will be posting training events using the &amp;quot;Couch to 5K&amp;quot; training schedule. When more options are available, I will find some 5K events to post on the calendar for our &amp;quot;final exam&amp;quot;. :)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(we will be meeting twice a week for those who are training, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Friday or Saturday to keep with the schedule)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolrunnin...&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1 we are starting from scratch. Remember to bring your sneakers and some water!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couch to 5K, Week 1 Plan:   &lt;br /&gt;(train 3x during the week)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brisk five-minute warm up walk. &lt;br /&gt;Then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes. (8 times)   &lt;br /&gt;Don't worry, I'll bring the stop watch with the whistle so everyone knows when to start and stop the jogging.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday, April 25th   &lt;br /&gt;6:30pm   &lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School   &lt;br /&gt;Track   &lt;br /&gt;Meet at the entrance by the bleachers   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer: Julie   &lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: none   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by NOON on Monday, April 25th   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.
