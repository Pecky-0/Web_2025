&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been having a great group of new members coming to our bi-weekly Portsmouth and Dover social meetups. But those venues can be too small and cramp for everyone to get to meet and talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to allow all our members, old and new, to meet and get&amp;nbsp;acquainted&amp;nbsp;or to reconnect, we are having our annual fall party Saturday October 1 at the Puterbaugh freehold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we are going to revive the chowder competition that we had a few years back. Please feel free to bring a chowder dish to enter into the competition. Clam, seafood, corn, whatever. It's all good! Or bring a another dish to share, if you are not into chowder or you want something to eat outside of the chowder food group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates open at 4:00 PM. Vote counting happens promptly at 6:30 (but the party will go on until ???)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a bonfire [bring your own chair, if possible] and outdoor games [cornhole, etc]. Musical&amp;nbsp;instruments&amp;nbsp;welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a family friendly event. Kids&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;dogs are welcome and encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing time is whenever the last ember dies out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all there.&lt;/p&gt;
