I always laugh, ooh ahh and even learn something. The following youtube gives you an idea what it's about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gV6ThtY25Q" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are always several climbing pieces and I have to say I can't wait to see the tightroper in what looks like southern utah. Crazzeee! :o) I'm going on the 18th and 19th and just bought my tickets (there are different films on those nights) and so I thought I'd see if anyone else wants to go!  If you are interested, please purchase your own ticket at the following URL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.regenttheatre.com/events/banff2007.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.regentthea...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll try to get there around 6:30 but let's shoot for no later than 6:45 so we can get good seats. The show starts at 7. I hope to see you all there if not before! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:o)&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At 6:30 I will be inside with signs on our seats to reserve them as the theatre will not reserve any seats. We are also connecting with Boston Adventure Hiking and the Random Hikers so there are alot of us. :o)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2680784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337369830000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200156391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Banff Film Festival  - Day 1</name><id>7096540</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203377400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/7096540/</event_url></item>
