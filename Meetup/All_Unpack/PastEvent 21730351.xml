Out group - Please RSVP on only one of the groups.&amp;nbsp; Because we
haven't gone there in a while and it is so very good I decided
to&amp;nbsp;invite the&amp;nbsp;Ethnic Dining Group also. Let's make this a
great big party!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Havelis developed in India in ancient times as royal houses
where Royal guests would stay and be entertained. Laxman Sharma
(owner/chef) has continued this tradition of serving the King and
Queen at Haveli India in Middletown Connecticut. As, Laxman states
: his new King and Queen are the guests, who come to Haveli India
to be dined and pampered by his always polite and attentive staff.
Here you will find food fit for a King or a Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has dined here can attest to the wonderfully tasteful
and aromatic dishes...all served at your request. From the time you
are seated, you will be spoiled by the superb foods and impeccable
service. You will be seated in an atmosphere of serenity and will
mingle with friends, enjoying this unique dining experience and
great conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
