The fun starts right after the dam with warm up rapids and then leads to a streach of more challenging class 3 drops such as DEVILS ODDS and LANDSLIDE. Along the way we take time to play and work the river in a SURFING HOLE or 2. Each rapid gets more exciting as the trip builds toward the last and most difficult rapids of the day, DRAGONS TOOTH and the TERMINATOR. These rapids require precise manuevering by the guide and strong paddleing by each rafter through these class 4 rapids climax an awesome day of white water action...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$104 prepaid for saturday  $99 prepaid for friday and sunday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;river trip includes safety instruction, guide, transportation to and from river and a great lunch..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO IS INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF ACTION ?&lt;br /&gt;July 1, 6 or 7&lt;br /&gt;July 8&lt;br /&gt;July 15&lt;br /&gt;July 27, 28 or 29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 4&lt;br /&gt;august 5&lt;br /&gt;august 12&lt;br /&gt;august 18&lt;br /&gt;august 19&lt;br /&gt;august 24 or 25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few in sept and less in oct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crabapple Whitewater will handle the payment,&lt;br /&gt;all i would do is have you reserve under Meetup.com name for reservations..&lt;br /&gt;indicate you desire and month/date/ then later&lt;br /&gt;im going to choose one and just set up the info in the future with a complete event listing.. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182207725000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181784295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Deerfield River Monroe Bridge section Class 4 rapids Rafting Trip</name><id>5889270</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1182034800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5889270/</event_url></item>
