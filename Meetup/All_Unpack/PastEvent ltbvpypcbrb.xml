We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us.  This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to get there:&lt;br /&gt;We practice at the pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville.  Walk through the outdoor basketball courts to the rear of the building to find the pool entrance.  Take the stairs down to the ground floor and head through the locker rooms to get to the pool.  Practice will begin poolside at 7 pm.  Wear athletic clothing.  Although we won't do any swimming, you will get somewhat wet.  Parking is free in the school parking lot.  The T station at Porter Square is a 5 minute walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice will last about 2 hours.  We provide paddles and all the necessary equipment--just bring yourself!  No paddling experience is required.  We have an excellent coaching staff who will teach you everything you will need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Send questions to:  Dave Parker at dfitzparker@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.livingroot.org/" target="_blank"&gt;www.livingroot.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the tall guy with a paddle or a clipboard or a cat.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Parker</member_name><member_id>7135817</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294967555000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddle-boston</urlname><id>1135553</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Living Root Dragon Boat - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289167326000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indoor Dragon Boat Training with Living Root</name><id>ltbvpypcbrb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294963200000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddle-boston/events/15989107/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/3/global_6285315.jpeg</photo_url></item>
