Why not just sit in a cafe and write together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to bring a work in progress and spend an hour or two writing with others around doing the same. We also may exchange ideas, ask each other for suggestions and serve as a motivation to accomplish your self set goals, but most of the time we will be writing. You would be surprised how much you get done under the slight pressure of having others around writing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BackBay Borders on Boylston St. Boston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.borders.co.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.borders.co...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The cafe is upstairs, we will try to confiscate a table to sit around. I'm Meghan (MPM) and I will be writing on a white macbook. There are power outlets and free internet. Send me a message if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>MPM</member_name><member_id>9992733</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256335557000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255607540000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Writing in Company</name><id>11632513</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256162400000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/11632513/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/e/global_146222.jpeg</photo_url></item>
