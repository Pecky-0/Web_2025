&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of the Union&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Capra. Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Angela Lansbury, Van Johnson, Adolphe Menjou, Lewis Stone, Raymond Walburn, Margaret Hamilton, Carl (Alfalfa) Switzer, Charles Lane, Tor Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contemporary as ever, this literate comedy-drama (adapted from the Howard Lindsay-Russel Crouse play) casts Tracy as an industrialist who struggles to keep his integrity as he's swallowed into the political machinery of running for President. Hepburn is his wife and conscience, Lansbury a power-hungry millionairess backing the campaign, Van Johnson the sardonic campaign manager. Great entertainment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Best Video &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;Our 5200 square foot facility is home to over 60,000 movie titles on DVD and VHS. Additionally, we work closely with several huge warehouse suppliers who can deliver to us any one of over 100,000 more titles daily. Choose from newly released, recently released, or our collection of rare and out-of-print classic and cult films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Best Video is not just a place where you can pick up a great film. It’s a place that offers live music and spoken word events, Sunday kids matinees, and a coffee &amp;amp; wine bar where you can hang out. It is also a place that hires local people, patronizes local vendors and suppliers, and keeps its revenues and salaries in the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time when community small business institutions are being bulldozed by soulless corporate chains and distant online behemoths we believe there is still a place for a local-rooted business with heart and soul that thrives on catering to your needs on a face-to-face, personal basis.&lt;/p&gt;
