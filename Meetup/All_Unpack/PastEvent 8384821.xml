<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Sean Merritt and Daniel Green will lead a discussion of Scala at the JAVA meetup on Monday, August 18th @ 6.30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Scala is a hybrid Functional and Object Oriented programming language that runs in the JVM. It is the creation of Martin Odersky, who was a major contributor to Java Generics and also was the original author of the current Java Compiler. Like Java, Scala is statically typed but has a more flexible and friendly Type System. While some may dispute the productivity advantages of such a language, our experience is that we get more done faster and have fun doing it. This talk is an entry level introduction, that seeks to expose some of the more striking features of the language.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetings are personal, engaging and everybody is sharing in the topic at hand. Come and share your experience with your peers. Presentations/discussions are held at MIT's EHS Office, 265 Massachusetts Ave, upstairs from the MIT Museum; drinks/food are at bar near by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Thank you to the many members that RSVP (one way or another). This helps your humble organizer to manage the crowd at the venue.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The entrance is a gray door to the right of the main Museum entrance.
