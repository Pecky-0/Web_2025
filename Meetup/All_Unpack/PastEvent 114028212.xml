 Boston vs. NYC Food Trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Boston, we think we have the best food trucks around. And to prove it, we’re hosting the 2nd Food Truck Throwdown on Saturday, May 4th on the Rose Kennedy Greenway. Boston trucks will compete against our rival guest trucks from New York City, for bragging rights as to which is the best food truck city! We’ve partnered with NECN, New England Cable News, and are proud to have Jenny Johnson, host of TVDiner as our celebrity guest host for the afternoon. Judges will taste and vote on their favorite dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you really LOVE food trucks, sign up for the Food Truck Throwdown exclusive VIP Pass Experience. From 5-7 pm you'll get a sampling of 5 dishes from 5 different trucks of your choice. Our VIP Express Lane will give you direct access to y&lt;/span&gt;our favorite food. Plus you'll get the opportunity to meet the Chefs and Owners behind the trucks! Limited number of tickets available and will sell out quickly.
