&lt;p&gt;This will end up being the 3rd year it didn't make any sense to &lt;a style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; for this on a Saturday evening because there wasn't enough snow to go snow shoeing.  Yet now that there might finally be some significant snow fall on Friday (2-8-2013) the evening snowshoe event for Saturday (2-9-2013) was all ready full for reservations even before there was any snow on the ground to be worth snowshoeing on and the same for 2-16-2013.  Go figure.  So does anyone have any interest in doing this during the day on Saturday (2-9-2013) when there will likely be some actual snow on the ground to snowshoe on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day &lt;a style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;admission&lt;/a&gt; for renting snowshoes on a first come first served basis is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I will be working I will not be able to attend (Dave Bigelow).  Does anyone have any interest in hosting this or people can just do it as a group by accessing the information on line at the link without a host.  If you want to host let me know and I can set that up for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any adult guest you want to bring should &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/98448272/"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; on the meetup site as a member so they will be covered by the liability waiver. A minor would need a written waiver signed by a parent or guardian&lt;/p&gt;
