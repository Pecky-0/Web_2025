&lt;p&gt;We offered this as a New Years' day event and it was by far the most popular but alas, F1 was closed; but I promised to reschedule.  Some of the attendees for the Hobbit movie and dinner heard mention of F1 and wanted to go, so this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the site... &lt;a href="http://www.f1boston.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.f1boston.com/&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span&gt;781-848-2300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost is approximately $85 - $95 and this includes a $10 day-license and either a &lt;span&gt;3-Race Pack for $75.00 or a&lt;/span&gt; 4-Race Pack $85.00.  Races are in the range of 15 to 18 laps.  This is a pretty good amount of track time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no fee for the event but... to book as a group we need a minimum of eight people and preferably closer to 15.  As is often the case, people sign up and some don't show or cancel which can wreak havoc on group deals.  As soon as we have ten people signed up I will call the track and make the reservation.  Once the reservation is made we will each need to call the track and book our space - I will provide a phone number and contact name.  That saves Meetup fees, PayPal fees, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bring a friend, book early, it should be fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
