Coming back up on 169 in RI. So I thought, where is the farthest place we can go that's in our back yard? Worcester! Let's GO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure we will see if it looks interesting or scary or sick or all three and eventually head toward the Amherst area, did someone say popovers? hmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see everyone on the pike at 9AM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283084448000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282418140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>We're going to Worcester!</name><id>14495599</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283000400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/14495599/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/d/global_13850893.jpeg</photo_url></item>
