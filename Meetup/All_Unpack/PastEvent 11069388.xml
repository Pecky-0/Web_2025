We like to take the opportunity once a year to share what Humanism is and what it means to us as individuals and as a group.  This year's theme is &amp;quot;Paths to Humanism&amp;quot;.  You are welcome to arrive and mingle around 6:30 PM.  We will begin the formal meeting at 7 PM with an overview of the past years events and speakers.  We will then split into smaller groups, each headed by two members of our Steering and Outreach Committees.  The committee members will head off discussions at each table by relating their individual &amp;quot;path to Humanism,&amp;quot; and then invite individuals to share their experiences.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256143280000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249822959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paths to Humanism</name><id>11069388</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252450800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/11069388/</event_url></item>
