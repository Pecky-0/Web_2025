<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Timeless is a local Classics band that play danceable tunes. They are great to watch but their music really gets people on their feet dancing. I've seen this band and since I got up and danced, they know how to play their music. If your only going to the band, there is no need to sign up on the other meetup for dinner.  If you are going for dinner, then sign up there only (the entertainment is a given).  The band is scheduled to start 9:30pm. &lt;a href="http://www.timelessct.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Their web site - Timelessct.com .&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be holding a sign that says - Party Express/Annette/Meetup</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annette</member_name><member_id>2905200</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve C</member_name><member_id>6197158</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367846179000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
