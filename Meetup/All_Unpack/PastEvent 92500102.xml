It will be an anything goes evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have some of our games out, but if you have a new or favorite game, please feel free to bring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have plenty to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You should know that we are a household with a charming black cat, but he will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to a 3.5 year old and 1.5 year old, who should both be in bed, but they may pop their heads in or require us to step out at points during the night. (We make no guarantees about the attendance of our 17 year old.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it can be tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
