Last Sunday we had 6 people, it was great. Please reply if you want to play tomorrow at 8:30. Thanks, Marc. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301921117000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273953296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis Sunday 8:30 am at Dugger Park</name><id>16230133</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301833800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/16230133/</event_url></item>
