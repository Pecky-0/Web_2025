This time, I'd like to focus on Exit 12 in Merrimack.  Rush hour traffic bottlenecks at Exit 11, so it really is the perfect place to hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of banners, let try yard signs, 2x4 signs, maybe even 4x8.  That should free us up enough to do lots of waving too.  If you have any signs, bring them with you.  I'll bring extras too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make 4:00 but can make later, feel free to join us anytime.  We'll be out there until the sun goes down, about 5:45 - 6:00.  For parking, going north, take a right off Exit 12, then take another right onto DW Highway.  Axel's Ice Cream parking lot is on the right side.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194206983000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193808822000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Overpass Sign Wave</name><id>6648217</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194033600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6648217/</event_url></item>
