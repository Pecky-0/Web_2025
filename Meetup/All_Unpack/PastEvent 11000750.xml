Tuesdays/Wednesdays we actually do some work :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weekends are busy with trips to walmart, home depots, lunch buffets, friends get together, drive-outs or lazing on the couch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That leaves Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect evening to set some pace for making friends, meeting new people and then take the fun to the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What better way of breaking some ice and solving word hunger than over a glass of beer. (Ask Mr Obama if you dont believe me :) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So folks, thursday, Aug 6th, lets kick of a weekly happy hour session. It could follow up with dinner, drive or whatever else people want to do after a few round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venue: Cambridge Brewing Company, Cambridge, MA&lt;br /&gt;Time: 6:30 - 7:00 PM.  (This is just a general guideline and this is the time when I will be there. Ofcourse you are free to pop in late, earlier, whatever works)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For T-takers like me, the venue is very close to Kendall/MIT station on red line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see y'all there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249773040000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249047511000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour - The Desi Way</name><id>11000750</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249599600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/11000750/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/a/global_9800170.jpeg</photo_url></item>
