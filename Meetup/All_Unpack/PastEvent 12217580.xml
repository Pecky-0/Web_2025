<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>On the first Tuesday of each month, join Hostelling International for Cultural Café, an exploration of the food and culture of the Boston area. It's also a delicious fundraiser for our Cultural Kitchen program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annapurna Restaurant in Porter Square Cambridge is our March restaurant, for Tuesday March 2nd.  Annapurna specializes in Mountain Food from South Asia - Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.  The exact menu has not been set, but the Afghani specialties in particular are delicious.  The warm Himalayan-style spicing of the dishes is perfect for a late winter's night!  The owner will say a few words about his Nepal culture and food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP by February 25th for this affordable and fun event.  You may do so online at &lt;a href="http://culturalcafemarch.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://culturalcafema...&lt;/a&gt; or by signing up with Karin directly by e-mailing kturer@usahostels.org or calling 617-718-7990 ext 23.  REMEMBER, YOU MUST PRE-PAY IN ORDER TO SECURE YOUR SPACE AT THE MEETUP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;***more about Cultural Kitchen and Cultural Café***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an afterschool activity, Cultural Kitchen teaches Boston and Somerville youth about culture and diversity using cooking as the primary vehicle - just like travelers at our hostels learn about one another while cooking together in the hostel kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cultural Café gives us a chance to experience something similar to what the students experience in our program.  The setting is informal as we gather to build community, share a delicious meal, learn a bit about Himalayan culture, and support a great cause.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at the large reserved table (it is not a big restaurant)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1267747862000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Culturalcafe</urlname><id>1554280</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Cultural Café - Dine Out for a Cause</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262629134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March meetup at Annapurna Restaurant</name><id>12217580</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267574400000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Culturalcafe/events/12217580/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/7/global_12590823.jpeg</photo_url></item>
