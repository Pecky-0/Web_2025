<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I did the 20 mile Walk for Hunger last weekend at Geoff and Joy's suggestion, and when I looked it up on the map I found we did the first few miles already, down Beacon St.  That's why this one is 'Part 2' when there wasn't actually a Part 1.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start off at Cleveland Circle, walk around the Reservoir (Greg just did this recently, but I couldn't make it), then walk up Beacon St into Newton, down Walnut St, then up Centre St back to Newton Centre.  There's a D line stop right at Newton Centre to get you back into Boston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner afterwards for those who want to.  If I'm up to it I might walk back to Cleveland Circle after dinner.  It's only 2 T stops away and I feel that should be walkable to save the waiting and the $1.70. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=42.328981,-71.178617&amp;amp;spn=0.043022,0.077248&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;msid=117398343489237033278.0004699830f81d403504e" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll hang around for the Yes's, but if you're a Maybe make sure you get there on time or contact me so we'll wait. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See my pic, and will email my cell # to RSVPs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243170183000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242003238000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brighton to Newton - following the Walk for Hunger trail</name><id>10381948</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242858600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/10381948/</event_url></item>
