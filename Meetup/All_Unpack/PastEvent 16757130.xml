&lt;p&gt;Emily has won a happy hour from Black Bear Saloon and would like to share it with the group prior to Karaoke.&amp;nbsp; $2 Beer and Well drinks will be available from 7-9 to &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;up to 16 people that join Emily&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singing is not mandatory to attend, but I know some are looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Black Bears website, the actualy Karaoke starts at 9, so you have pleanty of time to gain some courage (liquid or otherwise)&amp;nbsp;by meeting up&amp;nbsp;at 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the $2 happy hour ends, you can enjoy Black Bears normal Karaoke night specials... which acording to thier website... "Every Wednesday night we are giving away $50 CASH to the best singer of the night, so be sure to get down here and show us what those pipes are made of! We have $3 Pints 7-close and $4.99 APPETIZERS until 10pm! On top of all that, you'll receive 1/2 off your food bill just for signing up for karaoke!!!"&amp;nbsp; (NOTE: websites have been wrong before, so I recommend confirming those parts of the deal when you get there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for Emily, whom can be reached at 203-812-9243.&amp;nbsp; She will add details as necissary as the day approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Emily.
