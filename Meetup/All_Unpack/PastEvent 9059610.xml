For those of you who can't get enough of the lingering foliage and delicious fall air, join us for another invigorating, early-morning adventure in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at Devil's Den, which is a nature preserve in Weston, CT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN:  The group will attempt to stay on level terrain for this hike, and avoid steep inclines.  We would like to spend around 4 hours in the woods, including breaks, and eat out for lunch afterward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at 8:00 a.m. (we will converge at the commuter parking lot on Route 34 in Orange; take Route 15, exit 58). We will leave from there at 8:15, arriving at Devil's Den by 9:00.  For those of you who plan to meet us in Weston, please let the group know in advance, so that we can be sure to make contact before we head into the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: At least one bottle of WATER, and a snack.  A rain jacket or poncho, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads. LAYERS. A hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dtravelroad/orange.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Map of Commuter Parking Lot in Orange (Take Route 15, exit 58)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;saddr=CT-34+%26+Abbey+Ct,+Orange,+CT+06477&amp;amp;daddr=33+Pent+Rd,+Weston,+CT+06883+(Nature+Conservancy+Devil%27s+Den)&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=%3BFUY5dQIdPhCg-yEyWkZzGGNQXg&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;sll=41.245289,-73.173065&amp;amp;sspn=0.270016,0.617981&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.235995,-73.21701&amp;amp;spn=0.270054,0.617981&amp;amp;z=11" target="_blank"&gt;Directions from Commuter Lot to Pent Road / Devil's Den &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to drive yourself, the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/connecticut/preserves/art17963.html" target="_blank"&gt;Park Website&lt;/a&gt; offers directions, or please see &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=+pent+road,+weston,+ct&amp;amp;sll=41.236318,-73.393285&amp;amp;sspn=0.007971,0.019312&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.236156,-73.394337&amp;amp;spn=0.007971,0.019312&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;g=pent+road,+weston,+ct&amp;amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank"&gt;Google Maps (Pent Road dead-ends at the Devil's Den preserve's main parking area).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is limited parking at the entrance.
