This season was very exciting&amp;nbsp;with many highs and lows. Our new practice boat was damaged by a fallen tree. We sent it out for repairs and was returned to us 6 weeks later. We are putting together this fund raiser to help with the costs and keep membership fees down. We'd like to invite all of our members, friends and family to this spaghetti dinner. Tickets are $10 ea. or 2 for $15. You may purchase tickets at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great opportunity to meet some of the dragonboat members and hear some of their great racing stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean State Dragon Boat Club&lt;/p&gt;
