We'll meet at the parking lot on Curzon Mill Rd., Newburyport at 10am. Depending on the weather we will take the longer trails and be out for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. I usually try to keep the pace a little more than "not too intense", about 2- 2 1/2 mph. This time of the year some trails will be wet so wear appropriate footwear. Here's more info from there web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former Moseley family estate on the Merrimack River, this park features 19th century gardens and plantings, rolling meadows, towering pines, and one of the largest naturally-occurring stands of mountain laurel in Massachusetts. Most breathtaking are the ornamental trees and masses of azaleas and rhododendrons that bloom in May and June. An exquisite place for walking, biking, horseback riding and informal picnics. Special Use Permits may be obtained for wedding ceremonies and similar programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural events are a regular feature during the summer. During the winter a portion of the park is off limits due to roosting bald eagles, but the remainder provides excellent cross country skiing and winter walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parking Fee at Maudslay State Park is $2.00. Annual Passes are available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ted</member_name><member_id>8103242</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367282425000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366937473000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A walk at Maudslay State Park is long overdue.</name><id>116235852</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367157600000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/116235852/</event_url></item>
