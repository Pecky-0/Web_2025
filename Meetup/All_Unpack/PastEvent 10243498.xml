Though they reaped glories for the trade industries, their innate value has been short-lived as they are often abandoned after use. Today, sustainability and affordability concerns have created new life for the shipping crate in the realm of architecture. The incredibly sturdy, though quite simple, rectangular shape is now housing for family, an inspirational art studio, a retail store and so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are many successful examples of crate architecture, can shipping crates really become a new building type or are they another trend that will soon ride away with the tide? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BSA's Emerging Professionals Network and PUMA host &amp;quot;The New Wave: Crate Architecture,&amp;quot; a panel discussion on May 4 at 6:00 pm at the PUMA mobile store that will be in Boston from April 26 to May 16 as part of the Volvo Ocean Race. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP to rsvp@architects.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about the Volvo Ocean Race and other events/activities while in Boston, please go to:&lt;a href="http://www.volvooceanraceatfanpierboston.com/port-stopover" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.volvoocean...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puma City Photo Credit: Danny Bright&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda Solinsky</member_name><member_id>5258600</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241730006000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Design Build Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonarchitects</urlname><id>696342</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Architecture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240421604000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The New Wave: Crate Architecture</name><id>10243498</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241474400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonarchitects/events/10243498/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/9/global_8289177.jpeg</photo_url></item>
