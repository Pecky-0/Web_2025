I'm not sure if you have heard - Alvin is missing in Livingston Park in Manchester.  A group of people have been assisting in capturing him, as he is very skittish.  I spent one evening this week, sitting and waiting.  He was around but was not caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night the owners of the dog received nonstop crank phone calls from a man who claimed to have caught Alvin and cut his head off.  What we do know is the posters were tampered with, where Alvin's head was removed from the posters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not deter me from assisting in the dog rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure what the next step will be - to continue waiting for Alvin with the trap, or to ask the SPCA for their net.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm trying to drum up support for either.  The trap will not be set without being monitored, even in the early morning hours.  The net will not be set without monitoring as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone interested in assisting?  If so, I can relay volunteers willing to work shifts to find Alvin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Emory Boarod&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay....we need to pull together and get volunteers to help in the search and rescue effort of Alvin.  This is an &lt;b&gt;Amber Alert !!&lt;/b&gt;    Please ...if you have any time to help..... contact Emory Board (Ann Marie) and sign up for a time slot at Livingston Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emory Board will oversee our efforts and help coordinate with Alvin's owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how many days this will take but any time you have to help would be much appreciated.   Morning,   afternoon,  evening,  night shift.   Please Help reunite Alvin with his mommy and daddy !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emory Board via email&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly   via phone 603-289-8021&lt;br /&gt;Holly's email:   hollyflah@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a photo of Alvin -  Please share this photo with everyone you know !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/a/e/d/event_17983757.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please Contact Emory Board to coordinate efforts</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284610315000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284555911000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Alvin is missing in Livingston Park - Please Help Bring Him Home !</name><id>14777850</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284606000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/14777850/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/4/global_17983764.jpeg</photo_url></item>
