One of my first employee purchases was a collection of short stories by John Sayles: &lt;em&gt;The Anarchists Convention&lt;/em&gt;. Then I saw his movie &lt;em&gt;The Return of the Secaucus Seven&lt;/em&gt;, and that was when I become a lifelong fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, May 3, 2011, John Sayles will be at Porter Square Books to talk about his latest book, &lt;em&gt;A Moment in the Sun&lt;/em&gt;. Come join me and get your copy signed, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be at Porter Square Books at 6:30 p.m. Look for my bright red backpack. I'll probably have my meetup sign, too, but look for the bright red backpack. I might not have enough hands to carry the book, the meetup sign, and a pen to get my book signed. (And there's always the chance that I won't want to look like a geek in the presence of John Sayles!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can go out afterward if people would like to do that. Christopher's is one option; it's across the street from the Porter Square Shopping Center, where Porter Square Books is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porter Square is a stop on the Red Line of the T. I suggest taking public transportation for this event. &lt;strong&gt;If you do drive, park on the street. If we leave the shopping center after the book-signing and your car is still parked in the lot, you will very likely be towed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Sayles's last name is misspelled on the Porter Square Books website, so if you go to their site, look for this event under their "Upcoming events" link with his name spelled as Salyes (incorrect) instead of Sayles (correct).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for my bright red backpack.
