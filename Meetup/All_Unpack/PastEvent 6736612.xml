<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We had a very successful help2learn chinese meetup, 6 people showed up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone enjoyed each other, even one of us couldn't speak any Chinese at all.  The rule was anything spoken in Chinese need to be repeated in English, so no one was left out ! Of course, once we get the conversation going, everything else will fall in place eventually ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you next meetup !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Edwin &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Edwin E Ouyang</member_name><member_id>4127989</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196394737000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mandarin Chinese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>help2learnchinese</urlname><id>490150</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Help2LearnChinese Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195002607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Help2LearnChinese November 4th Tuesday Meetup</name><id>6736612</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196208000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/help2learnchinese/events/6736612/</event_url></item>
