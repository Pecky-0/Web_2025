I will nail down the complete list of bars as we get closer to the event, but I was thinking staying in the back back/kenmore area to relive some of the moments of just a few days before at Marathon Monday!  I will keep the distance at about 0.5 miles in between bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post more info and FAQ as we get closer as well as the full list of bars.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/21/09 full list of bars, If you cannot make it to the first bar or two, no worries!  Just send me a text and I can give you our location and eta to next bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O'Leary's&lt;br /&gt;1010 Beacon St&lt;br /&gt;Brookline, MA 02446&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (617) 734-0049 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Tua Nua&lt;br /&gt;835 Beacon St&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02215-3303&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (617) 262-2121 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cornwall's&lt;br /&gt;654 Beacon Street&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt;(617) 262-3749&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossroads Irish Pub  &lt;br /&gt;495 Beacon St&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02215&lt;br /&gt;(617) 262-7371&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiskey's &lt;br /&gt;885 Boylston St, Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt; (617) 262-5551&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MJ O’Connor’s &lt;br /&gt;27 Columbus Ave, Boston &lt;br /&gt; (617) 482-2255&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beantown Pub&lt;br /&gt;100 Tremont St Boston, MA 02108 &lt;br /&gt;(617) 426-0111&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAQ to be posted soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAQ:&lt;br /&gt;How long is Pub Run?&lt;br /&gt;It varies but we spend about 30 minutes at each bar and about 15 minutes to get everyone from one bar to the next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far is it between bars?&lt;br /&gt;About .5 miles, the longest is about .75 miles between bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should I bring?&lt;br /&gt;Your ID, $$, T-pass, maybe a camera.  I would recommend a small backpack or one of those cinch backpacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should I wear?&lt;br /&gt;Running gear, including running shoes.  Dressing in layers is highly recommended.  If you have them, bring reflective materials/ blinking lights as it will be dark for the last few runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will happen if it rains?&lt;br /&gt;We'll get wet when running (yes pub run is rain or shine!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should I do to get ready for Pub Run?&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to eat and hydrate well in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it be fun?&lt;br /&gt;Well gosh, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy running and see you on Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in running gear drinking a beer</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>23</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240856589000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237265900000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PUB RUN!</name><id>9971192</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240682400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/9971192/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
