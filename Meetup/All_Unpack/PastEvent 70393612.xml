<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Our June 23rd hunt has been moved to July 7th. The further we get into the hunting season, the more likely we are to find more mushrooms. There are two entrances to Breakheart Reservation. We well meet at the Saugus entrance off the Lynn Fells Parkway. This week is full of rain, which makes for favorable condition for mushrooms. See you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jean Saunders</member_name><member_id>13202391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341832788000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fungi's &amp; gils</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mushroom-Lovers-USA</urlname><id>1497456</id><group_lat>42.4700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>Mushroom Lovers USA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340458390000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mushroom Hunt at Breakheart Reservation in Saugus</name><id>70393612</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341671400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mushroom-Lovers-USA/events/70393612/</event_url></item>
