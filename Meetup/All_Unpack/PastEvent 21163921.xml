&lt;p&gt;If we get a group of 10 or more the cost drops to $30&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had many people email me asking about a meetup surf lesson for beginner surfers, so here it is. This event is geared towards people who have not tried surfing before, or consider themselves beginners/learners and would like to improve their skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost will include wetsuit/board rental, and 1-hour surf instruction. I was told that as long as there is not another lesson scheduled immediately after us, that they normally let people practice on their own for a while after the lesson to try out their new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please plan on showing up a little bit early to be fitted with a wetsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to close RSVPs for this on Thursday afternoon so that I can let the shop know how many people will be attending. So please only RSVP is you know you can make it, and update your RSVP accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will also be SUP rentals available for rental. If you would like to use a SUP, please put "SUP" in your RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>11388242</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307922493000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Surfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>surfing-69</urlname><id>737305</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Surfing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307375293000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>beginner surfing lesson</name><id>21163921</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307800800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/surfing-69/events/21163921/</event_url></item>
