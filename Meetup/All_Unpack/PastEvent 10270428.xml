We can stay on the pavement, or take one of the many trails out into the woods. There is a small beach area on the largest pond, a stream that passes under a covered bridge, and a water wheel by the farthest pond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chatfield Hollow is located on Route 80, just west of the Route 81/80 traffic circle. There are parking lots on the right and left sides of the entrance, and we will meet just past there, at the ranger's booth.&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are welcome, but must be on a leash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest bringing a bottle of water, a hat (the bugs are out), and even bug spray. The warm weather is supposed to continue through the week, so we should have a great evening!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the ranger's booth at the entrance to the park.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241650101000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240766644000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Evening Stroll</name><id>10270428</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241128800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/10270428/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/5/global_8102245.jpeg</photo_url></item>
