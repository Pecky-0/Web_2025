I also have small popcorn and small soda vouchers for $3 each, if you'd like to save a bit o' green on snacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on Friday!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call my cell if you get lost, have a last-minute RSVP (either way) or are running late: 508/308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;Let's head to &lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809942490/info" target="_blank"&gt;The Reader&lt;/a&gt;, a Kate Winslet drama/romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;When he falls ill on his way home from school, 15 year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. The two begin an unexpected and passionate affair only for Hanna to suddenly and inexplicably disappear. Eight years later, Michael, now a young law student observing Nazi war trials, meets his former lover again, under very different circumstances. Hanna is on trial for a hideous crime, and as she refuses to defend herself, Michael gradually realizes his boyhood love may be guarding a secret she considers to be more shameful than murder.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's plan on the 7:00ish show. I'll update a few days before with exact times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome. Just be sure to include them in your RSVP so that I know how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we'll head to Friday's after the movie, if anyone's game for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please call me with any last-minute RSVPs (after 5:00 on the 20th) or directions if you get lost. 508-308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238196477000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236880261000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reader</name><id>9940442</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237590900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/9940442/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
