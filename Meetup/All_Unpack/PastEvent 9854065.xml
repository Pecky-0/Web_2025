The new trail details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trails: Start on White Dot, link to Cascade Link, link to Pumpelly to&lt;br /&gt;the summit.&lt;br /&gt;RT Distance: about 7 miles&lt;br /&gt;RT Time: About 4 to 5 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trail information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.qcc.mass.edu/brink/trav-rec/mt_monad/mmcascade.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.qcc.mass.e...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like Jaffrey is getting a good amount of snow yesterday and&lt;br /&gt;today, so snowshoes might be necessary.  Will update as the date gets&lt;br /&gt;closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its thousands of acres of protected highlands, 3,165-ft. Mt. Monadnock was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1987. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 40 miles of maintained foot trails, many of which lead to the bare rock summit through unique alpine vegetation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsurpassed 100-mile views to points in all six New England states are the reward for a climb. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A magnet for hikers, Monadnock is said to be the second most frequently climbed mountain in the world, after Japan's Mt. Fuji.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the &lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/283/pages/disclaimer/"&gt;NEHAAG disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hiker profile is complete so we can verify that your qualified to join us on this moderately rated mountain hike. Although not a 4000 ft hike, this is quite a workout with lots of boulder climbing. Proper clothing and footwear is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling is always advised and a great way to get to know your fellow members.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236694428000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235946640000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Monadnock via White Dot, Cascade, Pumpelly</name><id>9854065</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236520800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9854065/</event_url></item>
