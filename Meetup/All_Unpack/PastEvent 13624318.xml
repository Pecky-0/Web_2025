Discover the what, when, where and why. &lt;br /&gt;This will be a very large joint event. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, how are you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who else likes to meet new people? &lt;br /&gt;Who else wants wants to build their network? &lt;br /&gt;Who else enjoys a hot breakfast and a hot coffee or tea? &lt;br /&gt;Who else likes discover cute new cafes and places to hang out? &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in the summer we will buy a coffee and walk to the nearby park. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where we will be meeting? &lt;br /&gt;Discovering what everybody else is saying about the Bakery: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/athans-bakery-brookline" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This celebration will fill up quickly. The group size will be small (b/c the cafe has very limited amounts of seats and to make it more intimate). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a variety of groups here. Each with only 5 people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge group: &lt;a href="http://www.BostonVolunteer.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.BostonVolu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You love networking: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Discover-The-Boston-coffee-Meetup-Who-else/calendar/hffqnynmbgb/?from=list&amp;amp;offset=0"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You love tennis: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/tennis-lovers/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will fill up immediately. RSVP now (change later if necessary). &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading, you're already half way there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon! &lt;br /&gt;Josh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Free Wi-Fi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S. B/c there is HUGE demand (two days after posting the event we have ten people on the waiting list!) I opened it up to 3 more people. I can't open it up for more b/c of the very limited amount of seating. If there is still a spot open please RSVP through one of the other groups &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.BostonVolunteer.org/"&gt;http://www.BostonVolu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Discover-The-Boston-coffee-Meetup-Who-else/calendar/hffqnynmbgb/?from=list&amp;amp;offset=0"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/tennis-lovers/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.
