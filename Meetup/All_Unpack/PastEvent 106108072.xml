Enter Bartleby, a quiet, initially efficient, anti-social little man, who proceeds to work well as a copyist, but refuses to help out with any other office tasks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy, Bartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, 'I would prefer not to.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bartleby's &lt;/em&gt;famous defiance has been considered a precursor to absurdist literature, anticipating the themes we would later encounter in the work of Franz Kafka (&lt;em&gt;The Trial,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A Hunger Artist).&lt;/em&gt; It is said that Herman Melville wrote &lt;em&gt;Bartleby&lt;/em&gt; as an emotional response to the fact that &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt; was not selling as well as he had expected. Sadly, &lt;em&gt;Bartleby&lt;/em&gt; was not especially popular upon publication either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Gaitskill's infamous short story, &lt;em&gt;Secretary&lt;/em&gt; takes place at a very different kind of lawyer's office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When he asked me to come into his office at the end of the day, I thought he was going to fire me. The idea was a relief, but a numbing one. I sat down and he fixed me with a look that was speculative but benign, for him. He leaned back in his chair in a comfortable way, one hand dangling sideways from his wrist. To my surprise, he began talking to me about my problems, as he saw them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will leave the rest of it up to you to read.&lt;/p&gt;
