Luckily our January meetup will be held in our large indoor play room so the dogs can have a good time, won't get too messy &amp;amp; we won't freeze!  Let me know if you would like me to pull out some agility equipment for them to play on too - we have a ring to jump through, weaving poles and a gate to jump!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held at Best Friends Pet Care off of Rt-97 less than a mile from I-95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200541404000</updated><rating><average>3.20000004768</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197745425000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs January Meetup</name><id>6917592</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200160800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/6917592/</event_url></item>
