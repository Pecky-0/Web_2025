Writing with the same cheeky tone that has made his blog one of the most popular food sites on the Internet, Lebovitz presents an eclectic collection of vignettes illustrating his experiences living as an expatriate in Paris. After reading accounts of perpetually out-of-service public toilets and hospitals that require patients to BYOB (bring your own bandages), one begins to question what, exactly, Lebovitz finds so intoxicating about the City of Lights. It certainly isn't something in the water, but it just might be in le chocolat chaud. With this book, for the first time Lebovitz expands beyond his standard repertoire of desserts and includes a smattering of savory recipes. These range from such classic French dishes as a warm goat cheese salad to nostalgic American favorites like oven-roasted pork ribs with ketchup marinade. This is not to say Lebovitz's legions of sweet-toothed fans will be disappointed—many of the 50 recipes are made with plenty of butter and sugar; a flawless rendition of dulce de leche brownies is sure to become the home baker's equivalent of that très chic little black dress, returned to again and again.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hard to miss us...just ask the waiters for the book club :)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285860105000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281986746000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Readers:  "The Sweet Life in Paris", by David Lebovitz</name><id>14440551</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285799400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/14440551/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/c/e/global_1450046.jpeg</photo_url></item>
