<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This isn't a hike and we'll have to leave the kids behind but for anyone heading to the outdoors, map and compass skills are essential to navigating safely. REI Outdoor School Instructors are offering this class so we may learn how to use a compass and read a map to help us find our way in the wilderness. The Instructor will teach us all the parts of a compass and how to choose a style that works for each of us. They'll talk about magnetic north, true north, and magnetic variation (declination), and help us make sense of it all. Then weâ€™ll learn how to take a bearing, both in the field and projected onto a map, so we can learn how to triangulate our positions and plan a route. Speaking of maps, what do all those squiggly lines mean? They'll also discuss topographic maps and how to read them to understand our terrain. Then, on Saturday, Jan 24th. join them for an optional Map &amp;amp; Compass outing to put your new knowledge into practice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Advance class sign-up is highly recommended. Just call the Hingham REI at (781) 740-9430 to reserve a spot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: ** 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost: Member: $20, Non-Member: $40&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;br /&gt;Your compass, however, compasses will be available for participants to use. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REI OUTDOOR SCHOOL PROVIDES:&lt;br /&gt;Compass units and sample maps.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253214723000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>trail seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NE-Trail-Dogs</urlname><id>1347727</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>New England Trail Dogs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231419522000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>REI Map and Compass Basics (Class)</name><id>9475826</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232494200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NE-Trail-Dogs/events/9475826/</event_url></item>
