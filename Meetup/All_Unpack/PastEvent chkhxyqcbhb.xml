&lt;p&gt;Thursday night game night at Margaret's. I had so much fun last week that I think we'll just have to make this an every other week event for a while.&amp;nbsp;I'll have Soda, left over liquor from the previous events but other than that, it's BYOB.&amp;nbsp;I'll be cooking again come fall (probably)&amp;nbsp;but for now let's just plan to order something in. Last week it ended up being $7.00 pp for&amp;nbsp;Chinese&amp;nbsp;which I thought was a good value, just to give new comers an idea of costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an equal opportunity game playing group - We play Euro and party games as well as card games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring the $1.00&amp;nbsp;for Nina our awesome organizer to help pay for the cost of the meetup group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking logistics: Please park in the CVS or Funeral home parking lots or along the sideof the road without blocking people from getting in or out of their designated parking spots. Please do not park in the front or side of my house - Cranky neighbor issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergy alert: I have a long haired shedding machine (dog) named Princess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hosting and&amp;nbsp;playing games with all of you.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>163 S Main St. Colchester CT. 06415</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret </member_name><member_id>5111537</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325869579000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321999478000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game night at Margariiiiittttaaaasss</name><id>chkhxyqcbhb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325808000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/42099452/</event_url></item>
