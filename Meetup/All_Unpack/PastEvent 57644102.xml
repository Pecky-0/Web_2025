 &lt;br /&gt;

Those in Boston's vegetarian community from the early '90s through 2004 will remember the legendary Country Life Vegan Restaurant in Boston's financial district. &amp;nbsp;It was the "home" for the monthly&amp;nbsp;Boston Vegetarian Society&amp;nbsp;speaker events and vegan buffets until their closing in 2004. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;Boston Vegetarian Society (BVS)&amp;nbsp;are thrilled to bring to you, in a small way, Country Life: The Next Generation! &amp;nbsp;The Ashton kids who grew up working in the restaurant are now adults. &amp;nbsp;Craig Ashton, Jr. and his wife Shayna have joined with BVS in planning a vegan cooking class, teaching some favorite Country Life recipes we can make at home. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The location will be at the beautiful Peace Abbey in Sherborn (see below) where theBoston Vegetarian Society&amp;nbsp;holds their annual BVS special outing each June (or at another time during the summer). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The class will include demonstration of recipes by the versatile and talented cook Shayna Ashton, followed by hands-on learning sessions. &amp;nbsp;Then we will all sit down and enjoy a multi-course meal that we have prepared ourselves. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

SUNDAY, APRIL 1, 2012 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

2:45 p.m. - Arrive, check in, greet classmates &lt;br /&gt;

3:00 p.m. - Class begins, and will go till 6:30ish, including dinner &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Note: &lt;br /&gt;

This will be the first time the&amp;nbsp;Boston Vegetarian Society has&amp;nbsp;offered a class in this location, so please be flexible as the BVS organizers feel their way though the logistics of using this space! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;MENU * No animal ingredients *&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Seaside Chowder &lt;br /&gt;

No to clam chowder, yes to this creamy, flavorful vegetable chowder! &amp;nbsp;This recipe introduces a magic ingredient - raw cashew cream, a versatile ingredient which can be used to replace dairy cream in soups, desserts, and cheesy fillings. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Appetizer Surprise &lt;br /&gt;

Learn to make a quick and easy appetizer - a surprise because we're deciding which appetizer to teach! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Faux Caesar Salad &lt;br /&gt;

Learn to make tasty croutons and a delicious green goddess dressing to bathe the Romaine hearts, and top with toasted ground sesame seeds. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Did you know? &amp;nbsp;Sesame seeds are a rich source of many essential minerals including calcium, iron, manganese, zinc, magnesium, selenium, copper, and are high in B Complex vitamins such as niacin and folic acid. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Hawaiian Barbecue &lt;br /&gt;

One of Country Life's all-time favorite dishes, we'll learn to make the sweet-tangy barbecue sauce and tender home-made seitan ("wheat meat") that made this dish a legend. &amp;nbsp;Simmered with bell peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes, and pineapple and served over brown rice. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Vegan Cheesecake with Raspberry Coulis &lt;br /&gt;

Learn to make a cheesecake that ditches dairy and gives all the smooth creaminess you could want in a dessert. &amp;nbsp;We'll make a raspberry coulis &amp;nbsp;to top it off. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Beverage&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;nbsp;Freshly pressed strawberry lemonade with dinner &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Menu is subject to change. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;COST&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;

Recession era price: $29 &amp;nbsp;- includes instruction (demo and hands-on), recipes, and full dinner... and we'll have fun! &lt;br /&gt;
