I heard this is a good band so let's check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Yacht Club, Perched on the west bank of the Connecticut River, has been a proud land mark of Middletown for over almost ninety years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the Old Yacht Club is home to Harbor Park Restaurant, located in Middletown's riverfront Harbor Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our guests can enjoy our beautiful water views - or dine by one of our heartwarming fireplaces. We assure you that whether you are making a reservation for an intimate dinner for two or planning the wedding day of your dreams our attentive and experienced staff will make your special occasion a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.savagebrothersband.com/nightclub/nchome.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Savage Brothers Band &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367846250000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
