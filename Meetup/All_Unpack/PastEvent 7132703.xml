It is a little quieter and seems to be a perfect place for a casual meetup place.  We should be able to grab a bite to eat, a drink or two and actually hear what each other has to say without yelling.   The January meetup was very relaxed and friendly we had the whole room to ourselves.  I would love to see all you new members join us.  The food and drinks are affordable and there's plenty of room for us.   We would like to alternate nights of the week (to accommodate those with custody days).  Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>When you come in we will be in the room to the far left.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>10</count></rating><why>Get out and start off the new year by socializing with friends old and new.</why><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200532277000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group February Meetup</name><id>7132703</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203638400000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/7132703/</event_url></item>
