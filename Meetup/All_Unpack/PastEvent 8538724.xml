I think that this is something that might really resonate with all of us girls...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;FireHeart Workshop &amp;quot;Unlock Abundance&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As taught by Carol DeFrancisco&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday, August 23, 2008 (9:00am - 4:30pm)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at 38 Cameron Gallery in Cambridge, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;Learn more and Register online at:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://fireheartnation.wordpress.com/events/august-23-2008/" target="_blank"&gt;www.FireHeartNation.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://fireheartnation.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/invite_flyer.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Download the Event Flyer Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been working with Carol DeFrancisco as a personal mentor for about 8 years now and she is absolutely amazing. This is her very first workshop in Boston and I don't know when she'll be coming back, so it's definitely worth it to see her on Aug 23.  Her workshops mainly consist of &lt;b&gt;practical techniques&lt;/b&gt; to manage stress, increase skills necessary to communicate at a very authentic level, and improve relationships.  This one also focuses on helping to determine what we really want to create more of in our lives and how to be able to daily shift into a &lt;b&gt;heart-centered place&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has personally trained with Don Miguel Ruiz, the famed author of &amp;quot;The 4 Agreements&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mastery of Love&amp;quot;.  Carol is truly a world leader in transformational process!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our personal, financial and business worlds can be changed through&lt;b&gt; heart-driven performance&lt;/b&gt;. Tap the heartâ€™s innermost power and wisdom to create the world you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will receive:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;+ Simple techniques for shifting into your heart&lt;br /&gt;+ Skills for getting clear about what you desire to create&lt;br /&gt;+ Methods to unlock heart energy that delivers your dream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have any specific questions - really hope to see you there.  There are helpful rebates too (bring 1 person get $50 rebate; bring 2 people get $100 rebate; &lt;b&gt;bring 3 people and attend for free!&lt;/b&gt;).  Do forward this to anyone you think may be interested.  There are always folks in our personal circles of friends and family who would benefit from this technology - please invite them and encourage them to experience this workshop with you.  Life and new adventures are so much more fun when you get to share them with others!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Bernadette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;FireHeart Workshop &amp;quot;Unlock Abundance&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As taught by Carol DeFrancisco&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday, August 23, 2008 (9:00am - 4:30pm)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at 38 Cameron Gallery in Cambridge, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;Learn more and Register online at:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://fireheartnation.wordpress.com/events/august-23-2008/" target="_blank"&gt;www.FireHeartNation.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://fireheartnation.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/invite_flyer.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Download the Event Flyer Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Free Parking!
