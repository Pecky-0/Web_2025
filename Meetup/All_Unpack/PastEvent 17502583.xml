&lt;p&gt;Next month's book is The Secret Daughter by Shilpi Somaya Gowda. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;From Publishers Weekly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gowda's debut novel opens in a small Indian village with a young woman giving birth to a baby girl. The father intends to kill the baby (the fate of her sister born before her) but the mother, Kavita, has her spirited away to a Mumbai orphanage. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, Somer, a doctor who can't bear children, is persuaded by her Indian husband, Krishnan, to adopt a child from India. Somer reluctantly agrees and they go to India where they coincidentally adopt Kavita's daughter, Asha. Somer is overwhelmed by the unfamiliar country and concerned that the child will only bond with her husband because Asha and Krishnan will look alike, they will have their ancestry in common. Kavita, still mourning her baby girl, gives birth to a son. Asha grows up in California, feeling isolated from her heritage until at college she finds a way to visit her birth country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I hope to see you next month. &amp;nbsp;Also, the book for the meeting at the end of June will be announced shortly!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachel Greene</member_name><member_id>11862196</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307797278000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304286079000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May/June book club</name><id>17502583</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307304000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/17502583/</event_url></item>
