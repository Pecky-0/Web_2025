&lt;p&gt;“This powerful book accomplishes its poems with fine translations that reverberate its themes, and with moving responses to the verse of a late colleague. Bewilderment is the best work of a master whose major theme has always been human Loneliness.” -Richard Wilbur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Ferry is the Sophie Chantal Hart Professor Emeritus of English at Wellesley College and also teaches as Suffolk University. In 2011, he received the prestigious Ruth Lilley Poetry Prize for his lifetime accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348193049000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348167982000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>David Ferry reads from "Bewilderment"</name><id>83316912</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348182000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/83316912/</event_url></item>
