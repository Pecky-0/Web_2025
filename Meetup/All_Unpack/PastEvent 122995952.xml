&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are your Options.  I plan to follow part of a Marked Route, then Bike a Nice Section, that was not part of the Route.  There will be plenty of Water Views &amp;amp; the terrain is relatively flat.  After 15-16 Miles, we break at the Point Judith Lighthouse.  The slower Riders can head straight to the Lighthouse.  It is about 10-11 Miles to the Lighthouse.   We all can meet there for our Break.  Then we head back.  I am figuring 25-27 Miles, 22 Miles  for those who went straight to the Lighthouse.  Then you have the option to do the other section of the Wakefield Bike Path, which adds another 6 + Miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Faster Riders,there is a Marked Route thru Narragansett.  Feel free to go as fast as you want &amp;amp; break where ever.  This  Route is around 35 Miles or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Route is somewhere around 45-50 Miles.  It is a Marked Route, along the Back-Roads of South County.  Believe it or not, but it is all Downhill.  If you do not believe me, go  ask Andrea, we both rode it, this past Sunday.  Maybe I misspoke. It is all downhill, after you climb the Hill.  LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: 95 South / Exit 9, Route 4 South / Route 1 South / Route 138 West / go 4 Miles Left at Light on Route 108 / at the Light go  Right on Curtis Corner Rd. ( NOTE : Sign may say Saugatucket Rd ) / School is down on the Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
