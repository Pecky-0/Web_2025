The movie begins close to 8 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening's film is Bottle Rocket, which is a comedy. Plot: Upon his release from a mental hospital following a nervous breakdown, the directionless Anthony joins his friend Dignan, who seems far less sane than the him. Dignan has hatched a hare-brained scheme for an as-yet-unspecified crime spree that somehow involves his former boss, the (supposedly) legendary Mr. Henry. With the help of their pathetic neighbor and pal Bob, Anthony and Dignan pull a job and hit the road, where Anthony finds love with motel maid Inez. When our boys finally hook up with Mr. Henry, the ensuing escapade turns out to be far from what anyone expected. Directed by Wes Anderson featuring brothers Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson as well as Andrew Wilson and James Caan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get on the guest list by emailing moviemondays@libertyhotel.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.libertyhotel.com/pdf/MOVIE.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Event Flyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.libertyhotel.com/pdf/The_Yard_Menu.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Courtyard Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.libertyhotel.com/pdf/LibertyLoungeSpecialtyCocktails.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Cocktail Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to create your route by public transit.
