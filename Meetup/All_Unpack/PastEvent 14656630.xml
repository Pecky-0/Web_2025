If it isn't our career, or relationships, we wrestle with our bodies, hair or clothing styles of the moment. Some may be at a stage to dig deeper within -and find more meaning to life and determine why we are on this earthly plane at this time and place. However, we rarely can &amp;quot;reinvent&amp;quot; alone.&lt;br /&gt;Lifestyle coaching, probably the most talked about developmental intervention for the 21st century encourages and facilitates a change in how you think  so that you can begin to peel back the layers and realize your true potential, and see the world through more positive eyes, and believe you could become the person you would rather be and become it. &lt;br /&gt;With a philosophy that most things are possible, I coach women get to where they want to be, however challenging for them. If it unlocks even one small door to change I have done my part - the rest is up to you. I have been tagged as a &amp;quot;pollinator&amp;quot;,  always connecting those I meet with needs  to others  that can step in and offer assistance. &lt;br /&gt;Join me as I share a few key tidbits about reinvention, and highligt the upcoming &amp;quot;Re-Invention Convention&amp;quot; conference coming up in October: a powerful suite of informative workshops with some of the best professional life style coaches aimed at inspiring change for women. The focus is Career, Body and Health and Spirit. It is all about YOU! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.meetup.com/Shoreline-AWBL/photos/1071010/?success=uploaded" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patti Urban</member_name><member_id>12821348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285601978000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Association-of-Women-Business-leaders</urlname><id>1543671</id><group_lat>41.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>AWBL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283620393000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reinvention Convention  Details from the Speaker</name><id>14656630</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285331400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Association-of-Women-Business-leaders/events/14656630/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/e/global_17444606.jpeg</photo_url></item>
