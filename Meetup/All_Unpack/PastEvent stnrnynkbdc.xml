<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's time for another trip.  How about checking out Chicago at the best time of the year-summer.   I was thinking of leaving on Thursday, July 1 and return on Thursday, July 8.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some events that are happening in the city at the time include:  Taste of Chicago, Summer Dance, free concerts at Grant Park, take a river and walking tour with the Chicago Architure Foundation, July 4th fireworks, stroll in Bucktown/Wicker Park (an artist colony and foodie neighborhood).  It looks like a lively city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been to Chicago so it will be an adventure for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  my travel dates can be flexible.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jan E</member_name><member_id>4130628</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279843703000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274712131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Windy City- summer time in Chicago</name><id>stnrnynkbdc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279839600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/13577362/</event_url></item>
