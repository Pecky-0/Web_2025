Based on two critically acclaimed graphic novels by Iranian émigré Marjane Satrapi, the film, like the books, is a tale of revolution, war and teenage rebellion, told with nearly perfect amounts of humor, rue and horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the eyes of precocious and outspoken 9-year-old Marjane, we see a people's hopes dashed as fundamentalists take power?forcing the veil on women and imprisoning thousands. Clever and fearless, she outsmarts the &amp;quot;social guardians&amp;quot; and discovers punk, ABBA and Iron Maiden. Feeling vulnerable and alone in a strange land after being sent to school in Austria, she has to combat being equated with the religious fundamentalism and extremism she fled her country to escape. Featuring the voices of Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux and Simon Abkarian. Directed by Marjane Satrapi (based on her acclaimed memoir) and Vincent Paronnaud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Persepolis&lt;/b&gt; simply doesn?t look like any other animated film you?ve ever seen before, and that?s all to the good.  Ultimately, Satrapi?s story is the best of all possible worlds: an intimate tale set against a broad historical canvas, told in an engaging artistic manner. Because of this, there is simply no reason why Persepolis couldn?t click with audiences of all tastes and ages. It is that universal, and that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more reviews: &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/persepolis/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rottentoma...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will stand at the front of the Theater with a Meetup Sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200356214000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>7</count></rating><why>Scintillating discussion at area restaurant to follow</why><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198950284000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Persepolis</name><id>6988771</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200183300000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6988771/</event_url></item>
