Please RSVP. One of our members' dogs was mauled by a pit bull early this am. The owner is unemployed and her husband is on disability. Louie is a black maltipoo presently in dire condition at IVG vet emergency center in Natick. they won't start surgery until we have raised $4000. He will probably die if surgery isnt started soon. He is in an oxygen tent there. We've already raised $2200. If you can give anything, even $5.00 please call IVG at 508 720 3700. Tell them you are donating to Louie Smith's fund. They take credit cards and are very trustworthy and reputable. Please email me at laptopmaltese@aol.com for more info and a picture. Please help. The pit bull owners refuse to help and changed their phone number when asked. If this were your dog, I would write this same letter to everyone in this group. If each one of us just gave $5 Louie's surgery could start tonight. Thanks, Kim 508 380 6829&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355705234000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Small Dog Breed Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-136</urlname><id>727218</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Massachusetts Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1354587926000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mass. sSmall Breed Dog , Dec 16/pitbull mauls member's dog donations requested</name><id>93965232</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355684400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-136/events/93965232/</event_url></item>
