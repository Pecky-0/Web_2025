It seemed like there were folks who wanted to participate and on the waiting list... So Patrick is running another date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and join us for a special treat, please be our guest as we introduce you to our animals and facility. Join us for a walk in the woods with Denahee, one of our youngest wolves. Enjoy some quiet time in the woods and feel free to take pictures, capturing memories to cherish forever. After we emerge from the woods, join us for some refreshments and story sharing to end the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the fee is only what the venue charges and it needs to be sent in to them at the address in the description. Please make a note of the date and time on either a check or money order made out to &amp;quot;Wolftalk Educational Programs&amp;quot;  there is a strict limit of 20 people that can attend this so please dont rsvp if you cant definitively come as this always books up. payments must be received by the venue at least a week prior or your name will be removed from the rsvp yes list to make way for someone on the waiting list&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meet at the front gate.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick C.
