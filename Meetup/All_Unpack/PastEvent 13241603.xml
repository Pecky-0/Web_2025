This week we will deviate from the usual structure just slightly.  If you choose, please bring in a page or so of something that would give someone a taste of what you are working on and your style.  It does not have to be polished in any way.  We will not share these among the whole group but rather work in pairs.  Exchange the pages, read and then discuss with someone else in the group and get to know what they are working on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this we will return to our usual free productive time for people to just WRITE!  I hope this will be fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************&lt;br /&gt;Original description below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a work in progress and spend an hour or two writing with other writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the opportunity to discuss new ideas, encourage each other to meet self set goals, share websites and resources... Or just focus on your writing and see how much you can get done with a little dedicated time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BackBay Borders on Boylston St. Boston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.borders.co..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.borders.co...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The cafe is upstairs, we will try to confiscate a table to sit around. I'm Meghan (MPM) 617-595-1855. There are power outlets and free internet. Send me a message if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>MPM</member_name><member_id>9992733</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272579913000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271805021000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Writing: bring a page or so to share</name><id>13241603</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272406500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/13241603/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/e/global_146222.jpeg</photo_url></item>
