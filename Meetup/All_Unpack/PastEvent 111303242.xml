The Cranston section is flatter.  If anyone wants, they can do the Coventry section too.  Part of in was closed back in October, not sure if they opened it. I start in the middle, so no one will feel pressured riding more than they are comfortable with.  Feel free to ride at your own pace.  Those who are new to the Club, we usually split into a couple of groups, so everyone can ride at a pace they are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am starting at 1 pm, so that it should have warmed-up by then.  They are calling for temps in the low 50's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Route 295 South to exit #2, Route 2 South. Take a Right at the Light with the Dunkin Doughnuts and the Parking Lot is , 1/4 mile down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or Route 95 South to exit 12B, the exit splits stay LEFT Route 113 West. 1/2 Mile you will see the Dunkin Doughnuts, keep going straight thru the Light. The Parking Lot is 1/4 mile Down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming 95 North, get on Route 295 North and take I believe the first exit. It is either Route 2 South or Route 113 West.  All I know is that there is no Exit 12 on Route 95 heading North and you need to take Route 295 North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know how to Follow directions or Read a Map, LOL, Enter 700 East Ave Warwick R I in your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
