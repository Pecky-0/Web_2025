Let's meet at 10:30 at their ticket counter, to get there on time leave Boston by 7:30 AM.  I have three seats free in my car, happy to drive up anyone.  Carpooling is encouraged, a convenient spot to meet is the commuter lot at exit 47 on 93 in Methuen, just north of 495 interchange.  If you meet there at 8:30 you would be in Gunstock on time.  Back in Boston by 6:30 PM if we leave Gunstock at 3:30.  I'm going to do the Back Country Ridge, so anyone wanting back country can come with me, others can ski the groomed trails.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lets figure out how to carpool</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259072363000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235586441000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gunstock</name><id>9821833</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235835000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/9821833/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
