The evening will constitute an early celebration of the birthday (November 9, 1934) of Carl Sagan, who is generally considered the world&amp;rsquo;s leading spokeperson of his time (prior to his premature death on December 20, 1996) for our evolving mainstream understanding of the known universe&amp;mdash;and most especially of the place in it of life, and particularly of humanity, summarized in words such as these, which captured the imaginations of an entire generation: &amp;ldquo;The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.&amp;rdquo; Many of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading astronomers and cosmologists were first persuaded to take up the study of these fields by Sagan&amp;rsquo;s powerful message. If you have never seen Sagan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Cosmos,&amp;rdquo; or if you saw it long ago and would like to recreate your first reactions, join us for an inspiring evening, including a discussion of the philosophical, religious, and other social implications of the TV series.
