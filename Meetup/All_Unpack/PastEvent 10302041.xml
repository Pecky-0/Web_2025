Congressman Frank needs to hear how many people are taking a stand and demanding accountability and transparency in government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to flood his lines (all day) with calls in support of H.R.1207!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU can reach Congressman Frank by calling the Capital Switch-Board and asking to be directed to his office at: (202) 224-3121&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or, YOU can call his main office at (617) 332-3920.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make a few calls today... It takes less than 5-minutes!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241363316000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241093142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May Day - Phone Bomb Congressman Barney Frank !</name><id>10302041</id><headcount>100</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241179200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/10302041/</event_url></item>
