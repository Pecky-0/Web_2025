It is on National Forest Lands in the White Mountains National Park. To get to the parking lot, turn left for the Waterville Valley downhill center, but bear off to the right onto Tripoli Road then left onto Depot Camp. Here is the map of the &lt;a href="http://www.waterville.com/wvassets/files/79/village.map.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a map of the &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/1330889/greely_ponds.pdf"&gt;trail&lt;/a&gt; as posted in the files section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not groomed trails and it is a long uphill trek only suitable to people in good shape and with &lt;br /&gt;intermediate/advanced skills and able to negotiate single track skiing up and downhill. The route is about 6 miles, if we are doing well we could add on a loop to make the day longer. Jack has done it this winter and it took him 2.5 hours to go up and back. Its all tracked in so we don't have to break trail, and the snow should still be frozen according to the weather it will not get above freezing there right through the weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterville Valley Nordic center is right there, if someone wants to come along and ski groomed trails you can do that, you can even start from the same parking lot we are meeting in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each person going up to Greely must bring &lt;br /&gt;1. a day pack with &lt;br /&gt;2. at least a full liter of water, 2 liters is safer &lt;br /&gt;3. a dry shirt &lt;br /&gt;4. room to remove your sweater and put it into the pack &lt;br /&gt;5. lunch and some snack food &lt;br /&gt;6. warm gloves in case usual gloves get wet or lost &lt;br /&gt;7. warm hat if not wearing a warm hat &lt;br /&gt;8. cell phone &lt;br /&gt;9. I will bring trail maps and a compass, bring your own if you have them &lt;br /&gt;10. some toilet paper (just in case) &lt;br /&gt;11. a windproof outer jacket that can be removed and put into the pack - it &lt;br /&gt;is really windy and cold crossing the ponds, and you will probably want it for the downhill &lt;br /&gt;12. different kinds of wax for wax skis as snow conditions may change en route&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never done this trail, but it looks doable and very pretty according to this &lt;a href="http://hikethewhites.com/greeley/index.html"&gt;description.&lt;/a&gt;.  If the snow is reasonable it can be done on ordinary cross-country skis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same trip that Jack will hold/held on 2/8.  I can't make that date, so I'm going on this one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to the Depot Parking Lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yoris</member_name><member_id>8043284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235228245000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233975003000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back Country Tour - Greely Ponds, Waterville Valley, NH</name><id>9691228</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234711800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/9691228/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/3/1/global_7209633.jpeg</photo_url></item>
