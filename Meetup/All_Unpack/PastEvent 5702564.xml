(The &amp;quot;demand&amp;quot; basically being ben and walter...who both better show up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE THE MOVIE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the 9:45 show time was too late but both ben and walter have individually accepted the challenge and called me a little girl in the process...personally I thought name calling was unecessary but such is the law of the jungle.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW WITH ADDED BONUS!!!....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the movie doesn't start until 9:45 and also considering what an average episode of ATHF is like it's been decided the movie may be best viewed after a drink or two (or three or four).  So I'm up for meeting at the Anchor at 8:00 before making our way to the theatre at 9:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the schedule is as follows...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:00 - the ANCHOR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:45 - the Criterion for ATHF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11:00 - ? (in this case &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; probably equals &amp;quot;bed&amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;contact - dave 203-499-7777&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;number one in the hood G&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177718565000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177384567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back by popular demand...The Aqua Teens and ANCHOR!!
