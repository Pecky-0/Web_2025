They open their doors 3:00 pm - 7:00 pm with special exhibits, discussions, painting demos, live music, refreshments, and more- all in a casual reception environment. Maps can be found online @ www.artwalknewburyport.com or at the visitor's center when you arrive. This event is FREE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quote from someone that has attended in the past years; “ARTWALK has always been greNewburyat! Some of the galleries go all out with refreshments, entertainment, and appetizers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please be advised that this is a walking tour and we will be doing a LOT of that. &lt;/strong&gt; There is no set plan when finished with the tour- perhaps; Waterfront Park, the new self-serve ice cream parlor, the quaint lounges and restaurants, a walk along the water with some new friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS A SHARED EVENT WITH OTHER MEETUP GROUPS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALL ADULTS WELCOME. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

* WE WILL MEETUP between 3:00 and 3:15 pm In front of The Firehouse Center For The Arts. If facing the center, the bench to the left- by the shady tree, myself or someone will be wearing a meetup.com pin or have a sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MY CONTACT # IS: 978.289.7679 after 1PM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; **Parking can be tight - so try to plan accordingly. Please consider carpooling with other members. It’s a great way to get to know someone new or travel with a friend.
