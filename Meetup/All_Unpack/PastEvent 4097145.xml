So, if you invite someone new to meeting and they come, you will get a $6 credit.  In other words, bring a friend and it's free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Front Door to PHT is locked for security purposes.  If you arrive after 6:00PM, please call me on my cell phone (617-429-6571) and I will come open the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://us.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=club&amp;amp;c=1414" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=club&amp;amp;c=1414" target="_blank"&gt;http://us.ecademy.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Boston Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-124</urlname><id>179892</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>New England Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1106092930000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Ecademy February Meetup</name><id>4097145</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1109113200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-124/events/4097145/</event_url></item>
