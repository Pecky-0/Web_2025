&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sssfighting.com/teams/?u=SSSFIGHTING&amp;amp;s=htosports&amp;amp;t=c"&gt;http://www.sssfighting.com/teams/?u=SSSFIGHTING&amp;amp;s=htosports&amp;amp;t=c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best workout to get out aggression and stress! Throw on some gloves and punch it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Mahoney of South Shore Sportsfighting is offering this class to us for $10 person!! (CASH ONLY and PLEASE bring exact change)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be trained like the beginner kickboxing and cardio classes &amp;amp; class will&amp;nbsp;be led by&amp;nbsp;certified crossfit traines.&amp;nbsp; After a brief warmup with some jogging, squats, jumping jacks... to get us moving and ready to go! &lt;br /&gt;

We'll have some instruction on how to properly kick and punch, then practice with holding mitts for each other and using bags. I've even learned how to a choke hold the right way and some grappling moves. &lt;br /&gt;

But don't worry you won't get punched in the face! It's just about fitness and fun. &lt;br /&gt;

You will sweat and this is a GREAT workout, but even more fun! And a very inexpensive way to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan on bringing: &lt;br /&gt;

Water &lt;br /&gt;

a towel (remember you WILL sweat!) &lt;br /&gt;

If you have them, gloves, wraps &amp;amp; shin pads, but they do have loaners if not &lt;br /&gt;

**$10 CASH, EXACT CHANGE PLEASE!**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great attitude to have fun! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

GUESTS ARE WELCOME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is open to up to 35 members! &lt;br /&gt;

We will need at least 10 people for this event to be held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please update your RSVP by Friday March 23rd at 4pm so I can give a final count to Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you show up early, the kids class ends at 12:30 if you want to watch them fight it out too!&amp;nbsp; :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>inside the studio- **NO STREET SHOES ON THE MATS!!!***</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>4336960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333703050000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330896236000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mixed Martial Arts Event!</name><id>54953052</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332694800000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/54953052/</event_url></item>
