Wonder what Narragansett Bay looks like south of the oil drums and the J&amp;amp;W Campus? Have you been thinking about learning to sail, but Newport is a haul? Here's your chance to check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edgewood Yacht Club is holding their annual Open House TODAY!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EYC is holding an Open House this Sunday between 1-4pm, so I'm posting it as an FYI. The members will be there (as will I), so if you've ever thought about checking out the sailing scene in the area this is a great place to see. There will be some boats on display, so you can talk to some boat owners and check out different kinds of boats. Refreshments will be served under the pavilion and everyone is very friendly and approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EYC is a historic, low-key yacht club and no one is snobby. Its entirely run by the members and the club dates back to the late 1800's so there's a lot of history. Unfortunately in January of 2011, the beautiful, historic clubhouse was hit by lightning and burned down. It was an incredibly sad event for the members and for the neighborhood of Edgewood. However, a plan for a new clubhouse has been presented and hopefully the clubhouse will be rebuilt in the coming years. In the meantime, the docks, marina and sailing school are all still active and the club thrives on! I run the Beetle Cat racing series on Wednesday nights beginning in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't know it already, sailing on Narragansett Bay is the best sailing on the East Coast and it can be affordable - yes, you can buy a boat for less than a used car!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have a sailing school! The only other sailing opportunity in Providence is through Community Boating at India Point. I learned to sail at EYC as an adult (they have an adult sailing program) and if you take lessons and graduate from the school the one-time application fee is waived to become a member. very reasonable social memberships are available too! So if you're the slightest bit curious, come on down and check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgewood Yacht Club is located 10 minutes south of Providence in the Edgewood section of Cranston off Narragansett Boulevard on Shaw Ave. at the foot of the hill (you can't go any further or you'll end up in the water). You can see the building to the left when you drive south on Narragansett Boulevard. Basically if you take Allens Ave. south and keep going (past that industrial section and the Johnson &amp;amp; Wales Campus) Allens Ave. turns into Narragansett Boulevard when you cross into Cranston. Pawtuxet Village is also in this area. So if you've never been to this section of Cranston - check it out!!! Besides, its a gorgeous day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be at this event for a few hours and wearing the black cap.
