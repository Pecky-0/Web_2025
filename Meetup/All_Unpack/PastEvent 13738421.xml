We can head there between 11 and 11:30 pm and we'll have head of line privlidge if there is one and we'll have a reduced cover.  It has had some good reviews and our members have said it was a fun time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that want to dance or a change of seen can head out.  Those that don't want to can stay.  It's all up to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West Hartford has actually made some national lists of up and coming places to go out on the town.  If you've been there than you know what they are talking about.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Center has actually been redone lately and has many places to go out to and you can always find one that fit's your style.  In general though the area is more upscale than Hartford downtown.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting up at Elbow Room and mingling there.  It's not guarenteed we'll stay their but it's a nice place to start.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting up top on the roof.  Call me if you get disorientated.  203-599-1120&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Roshi ~   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277220407000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276021391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Cool Place to go : West Hartford Center</name><id>13738421</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276909200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/13738421/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/e/5/global_15797605.jpeg</photo_url></item>
