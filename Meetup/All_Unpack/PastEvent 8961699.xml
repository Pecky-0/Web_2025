At our last general meeting the October 11 Mobilizing Committee decided to have a wrap up evaluation meeting on October 25th at 3:00 PM at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Encuentro 5&lt;br /&gt;33 Harrison Avenue, 5th Floor&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt;(Chinatown Stop on the Orange Line T)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this meeting we can discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our action as well as the O11 protests around the country and the movement generally. We also need to discuss where things are at financially and other issues that folks may want to bring up. A proposed agenda will be sent out to the listserv before the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Schaich</member_name><member_id>4406518</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Andrews</member_name><member_id>5009779</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Harris</member_name><member_id>5188497</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suren Moodliar</member_name><member_id>5714882</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225134926000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People for Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>stopthewars</urlname><id>708558</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Antiwar</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224017692000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October 11 Evaluation Meeting</name><id>8961699</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224961200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/stopthewars/events/8961699/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/global_2184137.jpeg</photo_url></item>
