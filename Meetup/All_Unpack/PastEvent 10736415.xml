Would it entice you to come or turn you off? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, just in case of the latter, let's just say that The Sevens Ale House carries its very own Sevens Ale, brewed by none other than Harpoon. Oh, and did I mention it's on draft for $5 a pint? (It's personally one of my favorite dark ales.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that's not enough, they have a pretty decent tap selection, as well a diverse by-the-bottle list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even still, the ambiance is pretty cool. I hear their chili is, too. And it's a hot spot for locals who are in the know, like to gather for a game of darts or prefer to watch the Sox games perched on a stool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll snag a booth.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alicia</member_name><member_id>8353321</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1248539320000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>beer buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CraftBeerCrew</urlname><id>1469154</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Craft Beer Crew</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245965077000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mid-Week Drinks: Beacon Hill</name><id>10736415</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247698800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CraftBeerCrew/events/10736415/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/d/global_9049101.jpeg</photo_url></item>
