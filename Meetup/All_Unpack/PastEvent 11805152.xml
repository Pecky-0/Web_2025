Barton Laws, Assistant Professor at Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine, who was until recently Senior Investigator in Social Science and Policy at Latin American Health Institute in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has received research funding from the Robert Wood Johnson and Kaiser Family Foundations, the Massachusetts Breast Cancer Research Program, the Charles Farnsworth Trust, and the Tufts/Brown/Lifespan Center for AIDS Research, as well as NIH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's also the author of the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://healthvsmedicine.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;stayin' alive&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; blog. This is a public health blog, and his point of view is informed by his training, professional experience and lots of good, solid peer-reviewed information. Join us for a provocative perspective on health care reform from someone who understands the intersection of public policy and healthcare delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start with a half hour of coffee and conversation at 7:30 PM. The main talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258591109000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257451840000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting - National Health Care Reform: Reconciling Justice And Liberty</name><id>11805152</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258417800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/11805152/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/global_5196186.jpeg</photo_url></item>
