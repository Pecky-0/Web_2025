One day, she impetuously takes up with Harry, a slightly older boy from the neighborhood, and the two run away from the city into the country for a summer of idle days and sultry nights. The season the two spend together is dreamily romantic and playful. Their sexuality is natural, exploratory and innocent. But, as with all seasons, this summer must end and, when the lovers return home to the city, the consequences of their time away become apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of MONIKA?s initial release, the nudity that now seems tame was considered either scandalous or salacious. The film was chopped up by its American distributor and released on the grindhouse circuit as ?a picture for wide screens and broad minds.? Among the impressionable eyes that took in the grandeur of Harriet Andersson?s naked body was most certainly a young Woody Allen ? the effects of which we are still feeling in his films today. Since restored to its full running time the Brattle is delighted to present this brand new 35mm print as a further tribute to the lasting legacy of the late, great Swedish director. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;?The most original film of the most original of directors? Without a single flaw!? ?
