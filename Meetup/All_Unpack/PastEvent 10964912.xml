Within 10 minutes the line for these Monday night movies wraps down the alley and around the corner. We can try to save a few seats though! No. This isn't the Quotathon that they had last year. Tsk. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. will be there around 6:10 pm. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair spiked in the front, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... anybody know of a quiet place we can get together for dinner after? I only know of a noisy bar we always stumble in, and a Thai place down the street that is always closing a half hour after we get there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Princess Bride (Amazon.com):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Princess-Bride-20th-Anniversary/dp/B000TJBNHG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1248662911&amp;amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;(1987)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;Starring&lt;/u&gt;: Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin &lt;u&gt;Director&lt;/u&gt;: Rob Reiner &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Screenwriter William Goldman's novel The Princess Bride earned its own loyal audience on the strength of its narrative voice and its gently satirical, hyperbolic spin on swashbuckled adventure that seemed almost purely literary. For all its derring-do and vivid over-the-top characters, the book's joy was dictated as much by the deadpan tone of its narrator and a winking acknowledgement of the clich√©s being sent up. Miraculously, director Rob Reiner and Goldman himself managed to visualize this romantic fable while keeping that external voice largely intact: using a storytelling framework, avuncular Grandpa (Peter Falk) gradually seduces his skeptical grandson (Fred Savage) into the absurd, irresistible melodrama of the title story. &lt;br /&gt;And what a story: a lowly stable boy, Westley (Cary Elwes), pledges his love to the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright), only to be abducted and reportedly killed by pirates while Buttercup is betrothed to the evil Prince Humperdinck. Even as Buttercup herself is kidnapped by a giant, a scheming criminal mastermind, and a master Spanish swordsman, a mysterious masked pirate (could it be Westley?) follows in pursuit. As they sail toward the Cliffs of Insanity... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The wild and woolly arcs of the story, the sudden twists of fate, and, above all, the cartoon-scaled characters all work because of Goldman's very funny script, Reiner's confident direction, and a terrific cast. Elwes and Wright, both sporting their best English accents, juggle romantic fervor and physical slapstick effortlessly, while supporting roles boast Mandy Patinkin (the swordsman Inigo Montoya), Wallace Shawn (the incredulous schemer Vizzini), and Christopher Guest (evil Count Rugen) with brief but funny cameos from Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, and Peter Cook&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purchase tickets:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/showtimes" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolidge.o...&lt;/a&gt; .. &lt;b&gt;Price:&lt;/b&gt; $9.75 (plus sevice charge if bought online)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions, Public Transporation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/map" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolidge.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;By train&lt;/u&gt;: take the Green Line (C branch to Cleveland Circle) trolley from downtown to Coolidge Corner via Beacon Street.
