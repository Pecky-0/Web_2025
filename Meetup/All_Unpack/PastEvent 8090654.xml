In between lobbing grenades and leaping from buildings, Zohan decides that what he'd really like to be doing is cutting hair. To escape his day job, he fakes his own death and books it to New York City, where a some &amp;quot;extra special treatment&amp;quot; for his clientele in the back room catapults him to fame and fortune.

Later he fought for Israeli independence before settling down to become a household name in hairdressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/youdontmesswiththezohan/trailer1/low.html" target="_blank"&gt;Zohan Theatrical Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby by Chatters at 6:30 p.m.  I've posted this for the evening, since this time slot has been popular.
