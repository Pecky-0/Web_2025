&lt;p&gt;This workshop is a great opportunity for those who are knowledgeable of the Enneagram basics and want to learn about it in more detail with others who share the same fascination! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;* If you are attending please already know the basics of the nine Enneagram types, wings and the three instinctual subtypes. If you understand the basics (just listed) then you should be fine - it will be new material but explained in a way that it is easy to understand.*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If you are interested in attending, please RSVP soon (not at the last minute). The more people who RSVP, the more others will want to also attend. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and/or share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Herb always has great snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who know the Enneagram basics but want to learn it on a deeper level this workshop is an awesome opportunity!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
