I have also changed the number to 15 so if you would like to come please RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is described by Boston.com as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;As soon as we sat down at Union Bar and Grille, we knew we were in the right place for brunch. The sunlight filtering through beige linen curtains gave the room a soft, civilized light. The menu listed no fewer than 14 entrees, including two salads and a Reuben sandwich. So omelets and eggs Benedict are options and not dominant features.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brunch menu can be found here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unionrestaurant.com/menu/brunch.html" target="_blank"&gt;Union Brunch Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving and T directions here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unionrestaurant.com/get_here/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Driving and T Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following MEMBER GUIDELINES were developed so our events run smoothly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our focus is on friendly and respectful gatherings while sharing a delicious meal. &lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly for events. &lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax. &lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend an event. &lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the event and you have not attended the event, it is counted as a NO-SHOW. &lt;br /&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within twenty-four hours of the event, it is counted as a NO-SHOW. &lt;br /&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW it will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events you are removed from the group.&lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation. &lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the event and you are not able to attend or are running late, you must contact the organizer directly by phone. &lt;br /&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy. &lt;br /&gt;Your feedback is appreciated, so please rate the event and venue by completing the surveys after the events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194485142000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186940150000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at Union Bar &amp; Grille</name><id>6167608</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190557800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/6167608/</event_url></item>
