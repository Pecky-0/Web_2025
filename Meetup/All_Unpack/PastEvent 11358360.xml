Out of misguided piety, Orgon has already offered Tartuffe his house, his fortune, and his daughter - but Tartuffe wants Elmire, Orgon's wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tartuffe was quickly banned by Louis XIV after its first performance, and the Archbishop of Paris threatened to excommunicate anyone who watched it (though Louis admitted that &amp;quot;it was found to be extremely diverting&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brown puts on some great productions, and they're much cheaper than Trinity or PPAC. &lt;b&gt;**Please buy your own ticket through the &lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Theatre_Speech_Dance/performances/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Brown Box Office&lt;/a&gt; -- get your ticket early as Brown's shows tend to sell out. **&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 8 p.m., but we'll meet in the Leeds Theatre lobby at 7:15 so we can get seats together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the play, we'll get dinner/drinks/apps at &lt;a href="http://www.paragonandviva.com/paragon.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cafe Paragon&lt;/a&gt;, around the corner on Thayer St.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for small red &amp; white Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255815121000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252812110000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tartuffe - Moliere - Brown University</name><id>11358360</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254611700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/11358360/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/d/4/global_10667588.jpeg</photo_url></item>
