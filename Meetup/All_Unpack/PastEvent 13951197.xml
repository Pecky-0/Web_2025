It costs $8 to get in and then the cost of whatever you make.  I spoke to the owner and she told me that items range in cost from $2 for a simple magnet to $25-$30 for a large platter.  I figured we could be creative for a while and then when we were finished head over to the Abington Ale House for some appetizers and cocktails. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told me that she would stay open until we are finished making our creations, so if we get caught up it's no problem.  Also, she explained that the items are typically available for pick-up 4 to 5 days later.  I guess she gets quite busy:-) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this seems like something of interest to everyone and we can gather a decent sized group! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always- I will need solid numbers in terms of RSVPas they will need to set aside table space for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks ladies!  I am looking forward to seeing both familiar and new faces! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lisa</member_name><member_id>2136226</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279895822000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fabulous Females</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore</urlname><id>1511961</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>South Shores' Fabulous Females Unite!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277840889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Something Different!!
