We are 6 trained ppl, who are taking their exams to become a rock climbing instructor.  Part of the exam is to take some folks - YOU - climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We limit this event to 15 ppl max, so this will be an excellent student to instructor ratio.  Besides that, this event will be overlooked by an experienced, professional guide.  And best of all - it's totally free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The focus of this event is to introduce ppl with little or no climbing experience to outdoor climbing.  We will set up top ropes, talk a little about safety and then have y'all climbing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 9 am at the Shea Memorial Rink parking lot, team up and then hike in to the cliff.  The cliff is a little hard to find, so please try to be on time.  We will climb until about 1 pm.  So it will be a nice half day of climbing.  &lt;br /&gt;Please click on the link for directions (Rattlesnake Rocks is &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;):  &lt;a href="http://amcbostonclimbers.org/map.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://amcbostonclimb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will bring ropes (+ the set up) and good vibes, you will bring your harness, shoes, belay device (if you have one), helmet (if you have one) and more good vibes.  We will have a couple of bonus harnesses, helmets and belay device with us but no extra shoes.  If you do not have climbing shoes, you can check with the local gyms whether they are renting some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions?  Shoot me an email!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climb away,&lt;br /&gt;Lilly&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a bright red shirt / jacket.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lilly</member_name><member_id>8472361</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1277759749000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277133021000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Intro into Climbing / Outdoor Climbing Class</name><id>13863315</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277643600000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/13863315/</event_url></item>
