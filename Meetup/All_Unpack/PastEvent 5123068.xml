This is our very first HALLOWEEN PARTY, so be sure the Puggies are in costume!  Your organizer will be shopping for prizes and ribbons in anticipation of 1st through 4th place best costume - we expect to see a whole lot of bats and ballerinas!  We hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST MONTH'S MEETUP...&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful time was had by all at the September meetup in Buford's backyard in Carver.  We had an amazing turnout, at least 25 people and over 30 Pugs.  There were Pugs everywhere, as well as the two French Bulldog regulars and what appeared to be a very tolerant poodle-something.  Buford had slimmed down 8 pounds to 31 pounds, and was a very svelte host!   We also celebrated Zoe's 1st birthday with a cake and a rousing chorus of Happy Birthday!  Pictures aren't here yet, but they're coming - the organizer forgot her camera!  Bad organizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby.  Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool.  There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have!  If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend.  Remember, it's VOLUNTARY!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1161264076000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1157915320000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug October Meetup</name><id>5123068</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1160330400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5123068/</event_url></item>
