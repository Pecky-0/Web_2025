Needless to say, it was quite different than what I was use to. I belonged to a similar group in Manhattan. And, what began as weekly brunch quickly grew into monthly movies, five mile Fridays (long runs in Central Park), Sunday afternoons at our fave neighborhood pub for a drink and even a book club of sorts. It was like college for adults.  For many of us, it really felt like an extension of college in that we were always surrounded by such a smart, fun, and diverse group of people.  And, everyone was extremely down to earth, kind and generous. There was never a dull moment either. Sometimes we'd have a big picnic in the park and hangout playing wiffle ball all afternoon. Afterwards, we'd continue the evening at our favorite 24hr diner, talking with Pete, the old man and our friend behind the counter. Pete always remembered our names and what we liked. It was the coolest thing - all of us sitting there together talking with Pete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound good?&lt;/p&gt;
