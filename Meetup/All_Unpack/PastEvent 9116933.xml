Being a part of this ongoing, interactive women's circle will help you find greater meaning and deepen your commitment to the Goddess and to life itself. The time is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2pm - 3:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Please, come 20 minutes in advance. The door will be closed at 2pm sharply.&lt;br /&gt;$10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, Luba&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - The Yoga studio, where we meet is located in &lt;u&gt;Watertown&lt;/u&gt; - do not confuse it with Mt.
