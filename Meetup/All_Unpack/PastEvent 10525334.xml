For one thing, our organizer has had to go out of town on business, and for the other, our new venue is not quite ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Nashua venue is changing! We are still invited to have our screenings at the Balanced Health Center, but they are moving over this weekend and the new facility will not be ready in time for the first Tuesday in June. Their new facility has an even larger &amp;quot;training room&amp;quot; which we are invited to view our videos in. It really looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are free to gather at the 603 Lounge, since the owner is friendly to alternative history discussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244590324000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243631158000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nashua - June meeting - CANCELLED</name><id>10525334</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243983600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/10525334/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/5/global_4632389.jpeg</photo_url></item>
