We'll be hanging out at the Beach in front of the Bicentenial Park at the North End of the Seawall across from Cinnamon Rainbows Surf Shop. Bring your kayak and your beach chair as we'll play in the water and practice some kayak safety skill as well as go for a leisurely paddle or you can just bask in the sun after playtime. The tide will be going out most of the day and seas are predicted to be calm with light winds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday... Sunny. Humid with highs in the upper 70s. Light and variable winds...Becoming southeast around 10 mph in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bathhouse/restrooms at North Beach as well as sandwich shop and Ice Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skills to practice are wet exits, towing, self and assisted rescues, rolling etc... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the day at the beach we'll have a post paddling Pot-Luck BBQ at my home on North Beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rt.1A Hampton at the corner of High Street and Ocean Boulevard. Look for Cinnamon Rainbows Surf Shop. The access for launching your kayak is it the North End of Bicentennial Park near the Fishermen Shacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the Link below for Google Maps Directions. also your best bet for avoiding traffic is to come down high Street or head South on Rt. 1A from North Hampton as Hampton Beach from Rt. 101 will probably have busy traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Cinnamon+Rainbows,+Hampton,+NH&amp;amp;sll=49.891235,-97.15369&amp;amp;sspn=32.073578,56.074219&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.942617,-70.794117&amp;amp;spn=0.008859,0.01369&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank"&gt;Directions to Cinnamon Ranibows &amp;amp; Bicentenial Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Kayaks</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Neil Sheehan</member_name><member_id>7739813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249342960000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>NE Seacoast Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastPaddlers</urlname><id>1238731</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249051929000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beach &amp; Kayaking &amp; Skills Day at Hampton's North Beach</name><id>11001122</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249140600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastPaddlers/events/11001122/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/a/global_8720682.jpeg</photo_url></item>
