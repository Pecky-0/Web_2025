Join us for an afternoon of fun at Catamount Adventures. Located on the Mass/NY border along Rt. 23, Catamount Adventures is the first large scale aerial forest adventure park in North America. Swiss Alpine Mountaineers designed the park, modeling it after popular ropes courses in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An aerial forest rope course consisting of platforms that have been installed in the trees with ropes and cables connecting them to form &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;canopy tours&amp;quot;. The objective is to move from tree platform to tree platform walking over the different secured bridges to complete the ropes course. There are some small scale zip lines throughout the eight different courses. Each ropes course will have a different degree of difficulty. There are no motorized rides in the park. Our park is all about active participation. While on the courses you are fully secured by your harness at all times, it is all about thrills, chills, but no spills. Rope courses range from beginner (where I will be!) to challenging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please visit their website for additional information about Catamount at www.catamounttrees.com. Tickets are $43 each. This event will be posted on other Meet Up groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drive is a little over 2 hours, so it would be great if we could carpool. Please specify in your RSVP if you would like to carpool. We can also bring food/drink (no glass bottles, alcohol) with us into Catamount. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send more info about where exactly we will meet once we arrive at Catamount as the event gets closer- most likely at the tix purchasing area.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an awesome group activity, so please join us! If it is raining, we will be rescheduling.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>More details on meeting spot at Catamount will come later.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Catherine </member_name><member_id>6146290</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245798547000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>metrowestyoungprofessionals</urlname><id>951974</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>Metro West Young Professionals Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243822885000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Outdoor Fun at Catamount Adventures Aerial Forest Rope Course </name><id>10540241</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245513600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/metrowestyoungprofessionals/events/10540241/</event_url></item>
