Please join me at Bullock's hangar for pizza Friday night at 6pm and help get us ready. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to attend the show to help, it would be beneficial to come and find out what will be happening and what you can do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so I know how much pizza to bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! &lt;br /&gt;Matt&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285428187000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285023226000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wings and Wheels Final Planning and info Meeting</name><id>14837810</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285365600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/14837810/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/4/8/global_18125448.jpeg</photo_url></item>
