This is a 5k Walk that begins and ends at Burlington Town Common with games, snacks, live music  and a raffle that includes Red Sox tickets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Teen Leaders Inspired to Give Hope to Teens&amp;quot; is a group of 300 Burlington  8th graders raising money to end child abuse.  Their goal is to raise $20,000.  We need walkers and donations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is $20 for adults to walk, $10 for kids.   It is completely amazing to see what good teenagers are capable of doing.
