&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we just had our last meet up at Sake but it looks like people are interested in hitting this venue again so why not, right?&amp;nbsp; As always, I ask that you let me know if you are not going to be able to make it prior to the event date.&amp;nbsp; I have to make&amp;nbsp;reservations with the EXACT number of guests for this restaurant in order to get seated at a Hibachi table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, in addition, if you haven't paid the annual $5.00 dues, please do so if you plan to attend:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you all soon!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
