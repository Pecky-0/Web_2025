I can only say that the last couple of months have been extremely busy for me hosting lots of guests from Europe, working and going to Germany myself that I just haven't been able to squeeze in a &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; for all of us! I hope none of you will hold that against me, because I promise to better myself :-). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope many of you can find time on Friday, July 24th around 7 p.m. to meet up at the Hot Club in Providence to catch up and share summer experiences and maybe to plan future meetups together. I am happy to hear suggestions and would love to hear if some of you have some ideas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to see many of you soon. Until then - enjoy the summer days! Bis ganz bald - tschuess!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the German flag!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249349445000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247532462000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Time for some good times again!</name><id>10869718</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248476400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/10869718/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
