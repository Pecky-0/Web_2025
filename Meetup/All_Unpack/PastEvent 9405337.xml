The energy is sold to an energy wholesaler for use on New England's power grid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Lynch of Covanta Haverhill will be our guide. He doesn't normally show the methane powered generator but agreed to do it for us. And he can give us information about the wind testing they are doing to see if they should build a big wind turbine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transportation: If you need a ride, please let me know. We'll work out some carpools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to Mike for setting this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glenn P DeRosa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>"We'll meet in lobby."</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Glenn P DeRosa</member_name><member_id>4460952</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235844654000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Energy Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>entrepreneur-1402</urlname><id>654497</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Green Business Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230604138000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waste to Energy Tour of Covanta - Haverill, MA</name><id>9405337</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232406000000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/entrepreneur-1402/events/9405337/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/f/global_5353295.jpeg</photo_url></item>
