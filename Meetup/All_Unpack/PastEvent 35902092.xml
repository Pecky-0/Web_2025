We'll attend some events, lectures, readings, signings, and spend some time releasing bookcrossed books as well in good bookcrossing spirit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at 10a to start a release walk around the premises of Copley / Boston Public Library. We'll do a release as well during lunchtime, which is when most attendees are out and about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual Boston Book Festival is a testament to the strength of the reading and literary communities in Boston, and always promises to be a fun time. Check out their website at: &lt;a href="http://bostonbookfest.org/"&gt;http://bostonbookfest.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to more traditional panels and lectures, there are exhibitors from independent presses, a special imagination area for kids, workshops for budding writers, a discussion of one story designated as the "One City One Story" (this year by Richard Russo), and a session called "Writer Idol" where untested writers read in front of a panel of literary expert judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your yellow Boston Unconvention bags (if you have one) and your bookcrossing books! If you want to come to the Festival later, just be sure to coordinate by letting us know when you'll be coming.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>H H</member_name><member_id>6628358</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318765598000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317621682000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SPECIAL - Boston Book Festival 2011 - Bookcrossing release walk</name><id>35902092</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318687200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/35902092/</event_url></item>
