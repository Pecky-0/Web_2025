Share stories of past adventures and talk about future ones!  Among many things, we usually discuss actual up-coming club group tours, as well as trips that members have taken, would like to take or dream of taking. We typically have 10 - 20 people show at our meetups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't matter whether you are a solo traveler, a couple or just friends; everyone is welcome. Please contact me if you'd like to attend so I can be sure to keep an eye out for you.
