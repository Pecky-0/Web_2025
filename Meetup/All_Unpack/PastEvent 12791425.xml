Let's go out and enjoy the weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jagolinzer Preserve in Limington&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is limited parking at the site and it's only 2 minutes from my house, so we'll meet at my house then carpool there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximately 45 minutes are required to walk the loop trail that passes an old dam, the brook, and the river. The trail is lined on the sides with small tree length logs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the walk, we can grab sandwiches from the local store and enjoy a late lunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to the many walking trails around here and throughout Maine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.healthymainewalks.org/findawalk.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.healthymai...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please keep an eye on the calendar. I'll be posting more walks/hikes in the near future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>8243578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268158668000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Out &amp; Abouters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Out-and-About-Group</urlname><id>1365436</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Out and About Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267797249000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend Walk</name><id>12791425</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267984800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Out-and-About-Group/events/12791425/</event_url></item>
