&lt;p&gt;We will be starting the day, and meeting at 11:00 am at Gardenia's Book store in NH- &lt;br /&gt;

 which is a&amp;nbsp; great "Witchy" store, that offers readings and wonderful items....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we will be doing one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is going to be forecasted that it is going to be a "wicked nice" day in New England-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will plan to have everyone bring a picnic lunch to have together at the picnic tables at Stonehenge- If not, I will be choosing a restaurant between Gardenia's and Stonehenge for us to go and have lunch....and then we will spend the rest of the day at America's Stonehenge.....This will be an educational trip about sunwheels, like Stonehenge in England, and how our ancestors were able to tell the time of the seasons, by where the sun hit the "standing stones" at the Equinoxes and the Solstices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is America's Stonehenge?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : small"&gt;Built by a Native American Culture or a migrant European population? No one knows for sure. A maze of man-made chambers, walls and ceremonial meeting places, America's Stonehenge is most likely the oldest man-made construction in the United States (over 4000 years old).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like Stonehenge in England, America's Stonehenge was built by ancient people well versed in astronomy and stone construction. It has been determined that the site is an accurate astronomical calendar. It was, and still can be, used to determine specific solar and lunar&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; events of the year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Various inscriptions have been found throughout the site including Ogham, Phoenician and Iberian Punic Script. Dr. Barry Fell of Harvard University did extensive work on the inscriptions found at the site. They are detailed in his book America B.C.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really cool place, with stone structures and buildings, and what is thought to have been a sacrifical altar...No one knows about the people who built this little village, but I suspect from the size of the structures, that it may have been the "little people" of our legends................&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be meeting at Gardenia's Book store in NH at 11:00 am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tala</member_name><member_id>5511934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334758032000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Wiccans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wiccan-169</urlname><id>793389</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0100021362</group_lon><name>Central Mass Wiccan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331513236000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>America's Stonehenge</name><id>55955572</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334458800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wiccan-169/events/55955572/</event_url></item>
