<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi once again.. or for the first time! We'll be headed back to the sanctuary to help out with some farm work.. de-pooping, feeding etc.. After that we feast on some delicious vegan yummies! Of course there will be plenty of time to love all the animals and to explore the many beautiful acres of fields and woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can also do me a favor and give me an idea of what you'll be bringing for food or drink so I can make sure we have everything we need and also bring your own silverware, cups and plates too if possible. We'll have extras just in case but we want to make sure we are being sustainable with all of that. Thanks for your help!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For more info on the sanctuary please visit: &lt;a href="http://www.maplefarmsanctuary.org/home/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.maplefarms...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions you can reach me at 508-459-1074 or you can email me as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dreads, glasses and a whole lot of veganess ;)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309486802000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220811219000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp October Meetup</name><id>8708398</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223218800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/8708398/</event_url></item>
