Forecast for today is for rain all day -- may be some breaks around the time we were going to start hiking, but then heavy rain is supposed to return. This trail is already a wet one, we don't want to be out there in the rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I'm rescheduling the hike for tomorrow -- Sunday, October 28 at 2:00 PM. Same place. Please update your RSVP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that parking is limited to maybe a dozen cars at this trailhead, so if we get the number of people who RSVP'd for Saturday, some will need to park on the street or across the street at Cheney Tech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the hike details again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some exercise to be ready for brunch the next day!  Work off those calories in advance!  We?ll hike the 3 .5 mile Laurel Marsh Trail in Manchester.  Meet in the parking lot, which is just off from Exit 60 from I-84, turn toward Manchester on Middle Turnpike West (Route 44) and lot is on the right.  This is a good hike for this time of year because it?s too buggy in the summer!  Be sure to RSVP so we know to look for you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193767811000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190550953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike! - change of date and time</name><id>6412104</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193594400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/6412104/</event_url></item>
