 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;2011 marks the 20th anniversary season of the Newport International Polo Series. All the stops have been pulled out to celebrate this milestone fittingly, with an all-star lineup of international competitors including the debuts of Kenya and Brazil, a City Series featuring US rivals and many festive events coordinated for fun on and off the field. This match, on Sept. 10, will be vs. Washington DC.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The match starts at 4pm, and gates open at noon.&amp;nbsp; It's full tailgating, so small grills, your own food and beverages are all allowed - if not encouraged! If you'd like to bring something to share please note it in your RSVP. Leashed dogs are also allowed as long as you clean up after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meetup is being planned with the Newport Meetup Group and co-coordinated with our super member, Alan. He reserved a $30 tailgating spot, so a few bucks from each person for that would be appreciated. &amp;nbsp; Note - The tailgating spot does NOT include individual tickets which&amp;nbsp;are $10 per person at the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>TBD closer to the date, but we'll have a tailgating spot!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan W</member_name><member_id>6265333</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1315826745000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309105633000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Polo match in Newport</name><id>23567411</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315677600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/23567411/</event_url></item>
