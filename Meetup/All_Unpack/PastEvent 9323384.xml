Arrive by yourself or bring your hungry friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further if you're seeking like-minded folks to share a side of pancakes with, want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while enjoying omlettes or savoring sushi, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in. If you want to build a strong cross-issue social justice movement, SoJust is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JP Seafood serves traditional American breakfast dishes PLUS you can choose from their sushi menu.  From personal experience and based on reviews &lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2008/12/05/brunch-jp-seafood-cafe.php" target="_blank"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; we know you're going to enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free parking is available behind the restaurant or across the street in the lot behind the liquor store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearest T stop is Green Street on the Orange line.
