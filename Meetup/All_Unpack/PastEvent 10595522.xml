See details of the event &lt;a href="http://artidea.org/event.php?id=146" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a chair/blanket, bring some beer/wine, bring your ability to enjoy free music while sitting outdoors with friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be heading to the green around 6:15 to stake out a place for my blanket and start enjoying my crackers with cheese and wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on sitting in front of the fountain close to the stage, but I can't say for sure where I'll be exactly, so if you can't find me give me a call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Jeanie (860) 942-4708&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245107327000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244380066000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Concert on the Green - Buckwheat Zydeco</name><id>10595522</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244934000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/10595522/</event_url></item>
