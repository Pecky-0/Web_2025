I found out that the movie will be playing upstairs....so I will be waiting in the concession area near the coffee vendor at the top of the escalators.  I will try to snag a table, if not, I will be standing in the area.&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a badge so new people can recognize me.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch the TRAILER:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809834165/video/4594432" target="_blank"&gt;http://movies.yahoo.c...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen King's The Mist  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Andre Braugher, Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, William Sadler, Frances Sternhagen, Jeffrey DeMunn  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;web site:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.themist-movie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.themist-mo...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Three-time OscarÂ®-nominee Frank Darabont (&amp;quot;The Green Mile,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Shawshank Redemption&amp;quot;) reunites with horror-master Stephen King to write and direct this chilling adaptation of the author's original short story. Following a violent thunderstorm, artist David Drayton and a small town community come under vicious attack from creatures prowling in a thick and unnatural mist. Local rumors point to an experiment called the 'The Arrowhead Project' conducted at a nearby top-secret military base, but questions as to the origins of the deadly vapor are secondary to the group's overall chances for survival. Retreating to a local supermarket, Drayton and the survivors must face-off against each other before taking a united stand against an enemy they cannot even see!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196122602000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192291072000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stephen King's The Mist</name><id>6542687</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195949700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/6542687/</event_url></item>
