Chris and I have decided to have a Oktoberfest party this year and with me doing the boxer meetup and the boxer rescue we decided why not make this for the Boxers!!  So we have decided that all proceeds will go to boxer rescue here in New England.  We are planning on having food, drinks, entertainment, games, music, and just an all around fun time and a great way to meet new boxer lovers and raise some money for the many boxers in need.  We are planning on getting a tent, dj or band, portable toilet all that fun stuff and if anyone has any connections or contacts please let me know.  So far Sam Adams has donated 10 cases of beer &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt; There will be a cover charge.  Thanks and hope to see everyone there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Kris&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristin</member_name><member_id>4522232</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226758558000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Boxer Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boxer-340</urlname><id>1175534</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4599990845</group_lon><name>The Massachusetts Boxer Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221675052000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boxtoberfest</name><id>8776831</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224957600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boxer-340/events/8776831/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_5545972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
