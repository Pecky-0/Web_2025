The Carnival Destiny leaves from San Juan, Puerto Rico on February 3rd at 10 pm, and returns on February 10th at 7 am.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(We'll get you back to work on Monday the 11th, not that you'll want to be there:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day will be spent in a port (there's no lazy sea time here, people!), including St. Thomas, Dominica, Barbados, St. Kitts, and the Dominica Republic (for a full 24 hours).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the following link for more details on the itinerary and the costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carnival.com/Itinerary.aspx?embkCode=SJU&amp;amp;itinCode=SCN&amp;amp;durDays=7&amp;amp;sailDate=2/3/2008&amp;amp;shipCode=DE&amp;amp;sailingID=45726&amp;amp;subRegionCode=CS&amp;amp;rateCode=BCA" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.carnival.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If unsuccessful, the details can be accessed by searching: &lt;a href="http://www.carnival.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.carnival.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for Southern Caribbean cruises in Feb 2008)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the costs are based on double occupancy.  Single occupancy doubles the listed price.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flights from Boston to San Juan are currently running around $350.  Direct flights exist and take about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to provide info to anyone interested so we can link up those &amp;quot;stateroom-mates&amp;quot; that wish to join us.  Check your calenders and your lives, and if you're up for a big winter getaway, RSVP away.  I'm more than willing to serve as a liaison for getting folks paired up to keep costs down.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Booking of any flights and cruises will be completely up to you.  I'm just a wee assistant organizer...travel agent is a hat yet to be donned:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costs do climb and rooms do fill as we get closer to February...hence the intrusion into your inboxes now:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to contact Lisa with all of the questions flooding your minds as we speak:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa/vetchick</member_name><member_id>4120480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202918291000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191520093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Southern Caribbean Cruise, Feb 3-10th </name><id>6487839</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202094000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/6487839/</event_url></item>
