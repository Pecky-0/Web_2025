Wouldn't it be nice to return to the carefree and loving nature of our youth? Life is simple when we forget about our problems, fears, worries, and doubts. Slowing the mind down and learning to breathe and relax is the most simple thing we can do to accomplish the most challenging of tasks. Learn to simplify your life by letting go of the complications that clutter the heart and mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher. Currently, he serves as Co-Director of the Order of Christ/Sophia, teaching and ministering to his spiritual students, and guiding fifteen Centers of Light and their ministers around the country. He travels between these Centers year-round, teaching and lecturing, as well as performing his music as a singer-songwriter of Mystical Christian folk rock. Many of the elements of the Mystical Christian teachings can be heard and experienced in Father Peter's music, encouraging the listener to seek and discover the Truth within. Listen to his music on Sophia Radio. When not traveling, Father Peter lives at the Center of Light in Chicago, IL.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273362131000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271970017000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  Simplify Your Life</name><id>13262221</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273188600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/13262221/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/3/global_4477619.jpeg</photo_url></item>
