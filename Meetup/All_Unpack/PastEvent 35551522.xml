&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://conservation.milfordnh.info/pdf_docs/trail_maps/map_trail_Tucker2pgs.pdf"&gt;http://conservation.milfordnh.info/pdf_docs/trail_maps/map_trail_Tucker2pgs.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Tucker Brook Town Forest is 285 acres of mostly forested, rolling terrain, and provides excellent hikes in all seasons. &amp;nbsp;I believe the route I plan to take will end up being approximately between 4.5 and 5.1 miles as they don't give a length on some of the trails. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 I plan on starting on the power line trail (2) and quickly turning off it onto Jimmy's Run (3) then taking the lower part of the Fall's Loop (4). Using a short section of the Ridge Trail (1) to take the Lower Path (6). Then using a short section of the Ridge Trail (1) to take the Brook Trail (8) to where it intersects with the Ridge Trail again. We will then start back towards Savage Rd. returning on the Ridge Trail then taking the Forest Trail (7). From where the Forest Trail then reconnects to the Ridge Trail we will follow the Ridge Trail back to the Power Line parking lot on Savage Rd. Any one who can figure out what I just said on the trail map will get a sticker. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 On parts of the Falls Loop Trail, the Lower Path, and the Brook Trail the trail is either beside or very near Tucker Brook for the water dogs who like to wade or swim. There is also a rather small water falls on the Falls Loop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first picture shows the parking lot under the power line. &amp;nbsp;The second picture shows a closer view of one of the signs.&lt;/p&gt;
