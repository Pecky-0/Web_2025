The second lecture is for students accepted to the program and those on the wait list.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students admitted to the program will then receive two weekends of instruction in the White Mountains. Accommodation and Saturday evening dinner is included in the price of the course. The two program weekends in New Hampshire will take place on January 22 - 23 and February 5 - 6.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the program is $275 for AMC members and $325 for non-members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact ice@bostonclimbers.org for questions and more details.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Blair</member_name><member_id>3942422</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Monica Trust</member_name><member_id>4555776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291252961000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286160969000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AMC's Ice Climbing Program (Class #1)</name><id>14990289</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291248000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/14990289/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/6/8/global_18466456.jpeg</photo_url></item>
