More info on the film festival is &lt;a href="http://www.hjff.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hjff.org...&lt;/a&gt;  There is a &amp;quot;Reel Talk&amp;quot; after the films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection of 8 films reflects on  the lessons of the Holocaust.  The films are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pigeon - Set during World War II and based on a true story, Pigeon recounts a rare and startling act of charity. Sumptuously shot and emotionally affecting, this film stars Academy Award winner Michael Lerner and Wendy Crewson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding Leah - Leah is a besutiful baby with bright blue eyes - eyes that might have permitted her to survive Hitler's Third Reich because they seemed so &amp;quot;Aryan&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah and Hayah - Inspired by 85 year old grandmother, Hayah Zisel, filmmaker Adi Targownik's 3D animated short tells the story of two girls - Hayah and her sister Sarah - on a train bound for their deaths in 1944.  But only one is really there.  Her unusual computer cartoon-shading technique creates a distinct tribute &amp;quot;in memory of those who were killed&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Next Harvest - In the Fall of 2008, a Jew from Gloucester, Massachusetts bought a house in picturesque Oppenheim, Germany. He became the first Jew to live in that city since the director’s mother, Marianne Orkin of Waterbury, CT, fled the Nazis with her brother and parents in 1941. The Next Harvest, filmed on location in this small city on the Rhine, will link viewers to the past through the story of the director’s grandfather, Carl Newman, once a respected Oppenheim vintner and last head of its thriving Jewish community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wall - The Wall is a glimpse into the life of Bernard, a New York City cellist who, after years of struggling against unbearable guilt, finds little solace in the world, save for his music. As Bernard’s fate hangs in the balance, a woman moves next door who shares not only his passion for music but is herself no stranger to tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torte Bluma - Real-life Franz Stangl, the Commandant of the Treblinka extermination camp from 1942 to 1943, enjoyed a most unusual relationship with the Jewish slave who cooked his meals. Teetering on the brink of insanity, their daily rituals were held together by a tenuous thread—until the cargo train brought a surprising arrival.&lt;br /&gt;Contains mature thematic Holocaust material; recommended for high school age and above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toyland - 1942: What happens when a German child believes that his Jewish neighbors are going to Toyland? A story about lies and guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing Dachau - In 1945, the Dachau concentration camp was liberated by American troops. Among them was a young American journalist, Marguerite Higgins, on the biggest war reporting job of her career up to that point. Beyond the objective history recording, there was always a human being behind the pen and the camera lens who personally experienced the discovery of such atrocities.&lt;br /&gt;Contains mature thematic Holocaust materials including graphic images; recommended for high school age and above.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269472486000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268095009000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tribute: Observations on Survival and Spirit</name><id>12822430</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269298800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/12822430/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
