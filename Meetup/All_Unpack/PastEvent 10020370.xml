But one mysterious girl fills her sheet of paper with rows of apparently random numbers instead. Fifty years later, a new generation of students examines the capsule's contents and the girl's cryptic message ends up in the hands of young Caleb Koestler. But it is Caleb's father, professor John Koestler, who makes the startling discovery that the encoded message predicts with pinpoint accuracy the dates, death tolls and coordinates of every major disaster of the past 50 years. As John further unravels the document's chilling secrets, he realizes the document foretells three additional events -- the last of which hints at destruction on a global scale and seems to somehow involve John and his son. When John's attempts to alert the authorities fall on deaf ears, he takes it upon himself to try to prevent more destruction from taking place. With the reluctant help of Diana Wayland and Abby Wayland, the daughter and granddaughter of the now-deceased author of the prophecies, John's increasingly desperate efforts take him on a heart-pounding race against time until he finds himself facing the ultimate disaster -- and the ultimate sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genres:&lt;/b&gt; Action/Adventure, Science Fiction/Fantasy and Thriller &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1810034384/video" target="_blank"&gt;Trailer Clip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1810034384/video/12529509" target="_blank"&gt;Watch an interview with Nicolas Cage from 'Knowing'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Running Time:&lt;/b&gt; 2 hrs. 1 min.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MPAA Rating:&lt;/b&gt; PG-13 for disaster sequences, disturbing images and brief strong language. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Filming Locations:&lt;/b&gt; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Produced in:&lt;/b&gt; United States&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Meet-up pin.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte V.</member_name><member_id>3105127</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238948595000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237855558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fan Flick "Knowing"</name><id>10020370</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238711400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/10020370/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/9/global_7814921.jpeg</photo_url></item>
