We'll meet up in the AM, climb for a while and then grill some stuff in the park. You don't need any outdoor experience or climbing gear. If you've never climbed before at all, you'd likely have more fun if you make it to one of the indoor meetups before but it's not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have your own gear and know what you're doing, we'd love for you to join us, but please mark yourself as NOT attending and say in the comments that you are attending and what gear you'll be bringing. We need to limit the number of inexperienced climbers to how many we can handle belaying/gear for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we get a better idea of who's coming we'll figure out exactly where to meet as there is limited parking in the closest car spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATES:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, a little cut and paste of Brien's directions:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Chatfield Holow is a state park in killingworth and charges admission – to avoid this you may park at the Chatfield trail head on rt 80 or in the public parking at the entrance but before the gate. (gets crowded) From New haven - take I-95 to exit 61 (rt 79 in Madison) . Take RT 79 north to Rt 80 ( circle) - turn right and follow rt 80 east to Chatfield Hollow . As you are heading east on rt 80 you will eventually head down a long hill. There will be a pullout on the right with parking for the Chatfield trail (climber's lot). If you miss the pull out you will reach the bottom of the hill and arrive at the main entrance to Chatfield. ( park there or go back up hill )&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;From the pull out climber's lot parking area walk uphill until you arrive at the barrier on the right – drop down into the woods, take a left after about 50 feet and follow the climber trails to the cliff 100 yards or so orange trail nearby - the cliff can be seen from road&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;If you choose to park inside the park - go around the lake to a field and park. It is close to the exit. I will arrive early and try to snag a table. From there Go to the road or take the orange (deep woods) trail for 15 minutes until you arrive at the cliff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;I (Matt) will be coming late but Rob has offered to help meet new people/lead them in along with Brien (if anyone else wants to earn cool points, feel free to help out with this too!). The parking at the climber's lot is VERY limited so what we'll try to do is have individuals park in the main lot right at the front of the park and then car pool over to the pull out up the road. If you know where you're going, feel free to head over to the cliff and hang out, though the car pooling between lots would still be helpful.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;If you get lost or anything, call Brien at 860 395-8122&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Food - We'll do like we did last time and we'll bring the essentials (burgers, buns, beer etc.) and take money donations to cover the cost. If you want to bring some chips, potato salad, beer or whatever else, do it up! Especially the beer!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;What to bring - posi vibes! If you have gear, bring it, if not don't worry about it. We have plenty of stuff for everyone.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;If you can get there early and know where you are going, Brien would LOVE any help with carrying in gear from the climber's pull out as we have a bunch of it and I'm gonna be too late to help bring stuff in.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Any other questions? Just ask Brien or myself. I hope everyone is as stoked as I am!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
