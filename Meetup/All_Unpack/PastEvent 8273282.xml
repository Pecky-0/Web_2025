It has provided a great community for like-minded software developers, managers and coaches to get together in a very informal way to discuss the ups and downs of using XP and other agile Software Development methods on a wide variety of projects in all sorts of organisations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar group formed in New York in January 2007, and the Boston group formed in September 2007.  The Boston group has since decided to move its meetings to Thursdays because of conflicts with other things on members' schedules.  We are currently planning to hold meetings on the first Thursday of each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The schedule is changing to the second Thursday for this month because the regular date would put it during the Agile2008 conference in Toronto, which some of our members will be attending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The August meeting will be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Thursday, August 14 from 6:30pm&lt;br /&gt;    * The Kinsale Irish Pub and Restaurant, 2 Center Plaza, Boston, MA 02108&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My photo and those of some other regulars are on the blog at http://xtcboston.bl</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Don Roby</member_name><member_id>5713230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218999979000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Extreme Programmers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>xp-28</urlname><id>840210</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>eXtreme Tuesday Club - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215126328000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>eXtreme Thursday Club - Boston August Meetup</name><id>8273282</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218753000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/xp-28/events/8273282/</event_url></item>
