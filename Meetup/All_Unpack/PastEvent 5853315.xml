<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It is about time. I have been busy and my computer was down for a month, sorry. I have been asked on many occasions, as to how different approaches work. This month we will explore what has worked for us. I will share some scripts and techniques. I invite each of you to tell us about books, scripts, cds, experiences, and what has been of benefit to you.&lt;br /&gt;We can also talk about what we all would like to have presented in the fall. I have several dozen possible speakers, you can help, by sharing where you would like to see us go.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dale</member_name><member_id>3116571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183857728000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181001669000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club July Meetup</name><id>5853315</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183417200000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/5853315/</event_url></item>
