See pictures under &amp;quot;Photos&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, the $2 fee is just to cover my Meetup expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the Details from last time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I boycotted Za for a year after it opened, stupidly thinking it was just a pretentious pizza joint. Well they do serve pizza, but it's not a joint, and the food is unlike anything you've ever experienced. And it's good! Fare is simple: they have pizza, they have little mounds they call salads (which I particularly love) and they have beer/wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their web site is: www.zarestaurant.com &lt;br /&gt;Pizzas are perhaps $15 and Salads perhaps $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is easy in Arlington.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the host.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Harold</member_name><member_id>5109349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210894377000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><why>Za serves pizza &amp; salad like no other place in the known universe.  It's original.  And it's inexpensive.  Yes, dear snobs, you can be high-falutin' and save money too.</why><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-625</urlname><id>824450</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Food Snobs Unite (FSU) - Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209581357000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Get Za'd</name><id>7844062</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210721400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-625/events/7844062/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/4/global_2985684.jpeg</photo_url></item>
