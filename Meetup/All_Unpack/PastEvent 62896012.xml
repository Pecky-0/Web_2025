&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our white wine journey has taken us through France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece, and Israel, but wait there's more!  As spring approaches, let's head to the warm climate of Spain to sample our way through that country's vineyards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that grape vines have been cultivated here for over 5000 years and today Spain has more acres under vineyard plantings that any other country in the world?  But is only the 3rd largest wine producer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start our white wine journey in the northern regions of Basque, Penedes, &amp;amp; Rias Baixas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers for regional appetizers to pair with the wines as greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noel</member_name><member_id>8463776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1339806311000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>White Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1441608</id><group_lat>42.5900001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335873948000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cata de Vinos Españoles</name><id>62896012</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339714800000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/events/62896012/</event_url></item>
