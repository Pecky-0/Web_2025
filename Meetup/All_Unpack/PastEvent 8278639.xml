Coming from West Haven / New Haven, I really &lt;br /&gt;Did not see the sign. I had to go beyond Rt. 8 and turn around &lt;br /&gt;in a McDonalds (after getting a coffee) and &lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the huge CGR sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is on North Street, but I could not &lt;br /&gt;Find a North Street sign any where at that intersection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe where it is... &lt;br /&gt;On Rt 67, when you get into Seymour, look for an intersection &lt;br /&gt;That has a Gulf Gas Station, Village View Pizza Restaurant, &lt;br /&gt;Exxon Gas Station and Citgo Gas Station. &lt;br /&gt;CGR is up a hill right behind the Gulf Gas Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall cancel and reschedule this Meet Up if there is any &lt;br /&gt;Adverse weather that might affect the driving conditions. &lt;br /&gt;Rt 67 is full of dangerous curves during normal &lt;br /&gt;Driving Conditions. &lt;br /&gt;Rt 34 to 115 to 67 was a little less risky than Rt 67.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B. &lt;br /&gt;Organizer &lt;br /&gt;Greater New Haven Unknown Zone &lt;br /&gt;Organizer of Coffee Talk &lt;br /&gt;Organizer of Karaoke Lovers&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be over by the bar 15 minutes before the Meet Up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219176716000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215217852000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coffe in a Ghostly Seymour Restaurant on August 17</name><id>8278639</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219003200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/coffee-397/events/8278639/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/e/global_2654830.jpeg</photo_url></item>
