You want to win your election? You want to have the most pro-liberty influence once you get elected? You need to be comfortable talking issues &amp;amp; debating in formal attire.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dreepa</member_name><member_id>4145573</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272907005000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272231913000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Campaign Training for NH Candidates</name><id>13287112</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272733200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/13287112/</event_url></item>
