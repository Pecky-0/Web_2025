We will enjoy a ride around the island at a leisurely pace exploring as we go! This ride is perfect for beginners as well as more experienced riders! Those who choose not to bike are also welcome to join us and can spend their time shopping, beaching or whatever!  &lt;br /&gt;  The agenda will be determined at a later date but RSVP now to save the date!!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of round trip for the high speed ferry is $42.00 and bringing a bike along is an additional $20.00.  You can also rent a bike on Block Island for about the same price.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP please let us know if you will be biking or not! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the amount of people who responded maybe, there is no room for anymore yes responses. If you are among the maybe RSVP's please change your response to yes or no as soon as you can to make room for definite yes replies!  If there is enough interest, I can plan another trip to the island later in the season! Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181585807000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174830302000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Block Island-AnnMarie Leader</name><id>5602982</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180784700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5602982/</event_url></item>
