Trivia is a Team Trivia contest played in bars and restaurants all over the country and is a product of Trailside Entertainment. Get your team of six (or fewer) people down to one of our sites to test your skill at an assortment of trivia questions, ranging from Anatomy to Literature, Movies to History. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't been to one of our games, then you have no idea what you're missing! The whole bar participates in a two hour Team Trivia game. Prizes vary from Gift Certificates, T-shirts, sporting event tickets and anything else we can think of.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do ask that all in attendance order at least item during the game.  Also, should you have any questions, please direct them to Steve.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, should this be a Meetup that you enjoy, please consider hosting a trivia night yourself.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Steve and Shaena</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228924889000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227927639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stump Trivia at Kitty O'Shea's Pub</name><id>9244806</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228692600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/9244806/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/f/global_6521039.jpeg</photo_url></item>
