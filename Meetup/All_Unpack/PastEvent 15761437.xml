Please note, they are offering this movie in two formats, real 3d and imax 3d, the 8 PM show is in real 3d.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie will be showing upstairs, so I will try to grab a table by the windows at the top of the escalators.  If you get there before me, please grab a table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailer for this movie make it look like it is going to be funny, and I love all the gadgets and the gorgeous car they use.....can't help it I am so a gadget girl.   Some of my favorite things in Bond movies were all those marvelous toys that Bond got to use.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, meetup is no longer letting us set up maybe as an option, in spite of the many complaints that were sent to them.  Idiots!   So don't blame the organizers....if you don't like it, email meetup to complain.  Maybe if they get enough emails about it they will put the option back in.    In any case, if you are rsvping yes, when you mean maybe, please put a note in your rsvp.  Also please keep it up to date and change to no if you are not going to attend.  It only takes a second and makes it easier for me to manage the event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss us on the way in, look for us after.   As always, we will be gathering after the movie, outside the room where was shown to discuss the movie a bit, allow for restroom breaks and get a head count for those who are interested in going out after.  Our usual stomping grounds...the Rockbottom will be closed for renovations, but I have some other options we can check out in the area.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: January 14, 2011 (3D/2D theaters and IMAX 3D)   &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Columbia Pictures (Sony)   &lt;br /&gt;Director: Michel Gondry   &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg   &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, Cameron Diaz, Christoph Waltz, Edward James Olmos, David Harbour, Tom Wilkinson   &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Action, Adventure, Crime   &lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: Not Available   &lt;br /&gt;Official Website:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegreenhornet/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sonypictur...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is the son of LA's most prominent and respected media magnate and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless existence on the party scene – until his father (Tom Wilkinson) mysteriously dies, leaving Britt his vast media empire.
