For members who want to learn more about Latino literature and culture, we offer a second monthly meetup. Karen will facilitate the first of these meetings, and will share one of her favorite short writings, the Desiderata. Margaret will follow with a poem by Gabriela Mistral. We'll read them aloud, then the group can discuss the two works. Got a favorite poem or song? Bring it along! (Note: this meetup does not replace our usual monthly fiesta on the third Tuesday of the month. You can choose one, or come to both!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret Vincent</member_name><member_id>1777042</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178146983000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175433378000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Evening Tertulia: poetry, readings, and songs</name><id>5625225</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177974000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/5625225/</event_url></item>
