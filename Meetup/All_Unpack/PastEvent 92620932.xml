This great group certainly warrants some year-end celebrating. Prepare to dust off your holiday duds and your good cheer for a Yuletide soiree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing makes the holidays more festive than spending an evening with good friends. So, let's have a night of it on Saturday, December 15. People are welcome to come as early as 4:00, though they can arrive at any point in the evening, and everyone is welcome to stay until the tinsel falls or David falls asleep. Please, bring a dish to share for a potluck buffet; beverages will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for those who are feeling extra festive, there will be a Yankee Swap. Every year that we do this, it winds up being a big hit. Should you please, bring a gender-neutral gift under $10 for an exchange game. In terms of planning when you would like to arrive, we would like to have the Yankee Swap around 7:30. There will also be door prizes throughout the evening, celebrating another great year we have had as a Meetup group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the evening, we'll pass on the board games, but get excited for some party games with prizes and socializing with some people you might not have met at previous Meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be a $5 fee for this Meetup. You can pay it in person in advance of the Meetup, the night of the Meetup, or in advance through Paypal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Our house, being an older home in Salem, has some smaller rooms, but we do want to celebrate with as many of you as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You should know that we are a household with a cat, but he will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to two small children (4 and 2) who will not be locked up for the evening, but for the most part will be in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*In case of a snow emergency, please make sure to check the website or your e-mail for any updates. You are always welcome to call the contact number as well. The snow date will be Saturday, January 5. If there is another snow storm then, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357695735000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353772727000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Annual Yuletide Gathering</name><id>92620932</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355605200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/92620932/</event_url></item>
