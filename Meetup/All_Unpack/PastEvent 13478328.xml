Hope to see you tonight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;There is a chance I'll have to make this movie a NoOrg during the day on Thursday (I may not be able to make it, in other words), so stay tuned for an email on Thursday to confirm that I'll be there or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the movie starts on Thursday night at 6:00, so let's meet at 5:30 right inside the theater ticket lobby and we'll buy tickets and snacks from there. An earlier movie this time -- trying out this time to see if we can attract more group members!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you Thursday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;I am admittedly a Kevin Costner/Morgan Freeman Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves fan. &amp;quot;Did God paint you?&amp;quot; is one of my favorite lines in any movie. (Another is &amp;quot;You're a handsome devil. What's your name?&amp;quot; Name the movie it's from &lt;b&gt;and the 2 scenes it's said in&lt;/b&gt; and I'll give you a free ticket to Robin Hood.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, when Russell Crowe makes a movie or tells an old tale again, I pay attention. &lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1810077954/info" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt;, is IMHO, one of the movies I'm excited for this summer movie season. If only to see if it stacks up to Costner's interpretation. Come with us and see the old tale of honor and justice played out in (maybe) a new way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 13th century England, Robin and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power. And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Robin Hood&amp;quot; chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in self-preservation, from his service in King Richard's army against the French. Upon Richard's death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marion, a woman skeptical of the identity and motivations of this crusader from the forest. Hoping to earn the hand of Maid Marion and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life. Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct injustices under the sheriff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their country weakened from decades of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and his men heed a call to ever greater adventure. This unlikeliest of heroes and his allies set off to protect their country from slipping into bloody civil war and return glory to England once more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE USUAL STUFF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet right inside the theater ticket lobby doors and then I can buy us all discounted tickets ($8.00 each for FMM members and their guests). I also have $3 vouchers each for small sodas and small popcorns (can be used towards a larger size). Exact change makes me like you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome, just be sure to include them in the RSVP so that I know who/how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP as up-to-date as possible. And please call me if you're going to be late or need to change your RSVP after I close RSVPs on the site (2 hours before we meet). My cell is: 508/308-4897. I'm also good for directions if you get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll head to Unos to chat about the movie (and just chat). I'll bring the coupons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll update the time a few days before the meetup, so keep an eye on your email!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you for Robin Hood!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;508/308-4897&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275089159000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273797470000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Robin Hood</name><id>13478328</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274995800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/13478328/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
