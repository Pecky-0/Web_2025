This one is for anyone who is longing to know for sure, inside themselves, that God is real and good. Can anyone really know this for sure? How does one come to really know this?&lt;br /&gt;Though we may have a strong belief that God is real, and though we may really hope that God is real, until we actually feel God’s presence, we don’t know for ourselves that God is really there. Similarly, though we may believe that God loves us, and though we may really hope that God does, until we actually feel God’s love for us, we don’t know for sure that we are loved by God. Mystics have always sought to find out for themselves, through direct experience, whether God is real and whether God loves them.  This seminar will help you begin to know how you can experience God and open to feel God’s love, so that God becomes not just a belief but an actual reality you can feel and come to know. Once you know for sure that you are completely loved and that God is real, you will be able to relax into life and into peace. Come join us for a day of experiencing the reality of God and God’s love. &lt;br /&gt;This seminar will incorporate an interactive lecture in the morning, a break for lunch and discussion, and a powerful experiential activity in the afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the presenter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher.
