<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Meet in front of Old Town Hall on Saturday, June 6th in Salem MA at 11AM. There is a parking garage nearby. We can carpool from Manchester, Nashua, etc. Carol has volunteered to give us a tour of Salem and we will explore the 1st Salem Arts Festival(salemartsfestival.com). For shopping and eating there are plenty of choices. I will send more details in the next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on being at the parking area on the right a little bit behind Wendy's in Londonderry at 10AM. Take exit 4 on rte 93. Go west toward Londonderry. Wendy's is on the right at the second stoplight. I have a beige Toyota Corolla. We can carpool from here to the rte 95/128 area to go to Salem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would anyone like to drive? We can share expenses. I don't have air conditioning in my car.
