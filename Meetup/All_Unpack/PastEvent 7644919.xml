Join us as we pray for peace to happen in our world. We join our hearts and minds together as each person has a chance to pray for something they would like to see happen in the world that is related to world peace like cleaning up our oceans or peace happiness in the minds of our leaders that they think of the most peaceful resolution or peace among our enemies.  What better way to contribute to world peace than by praying for it with a group of people who really care about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have been really powerful and they happen the first Wednesday of every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In LIght,&lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207350364000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Your prayers make a difference.</why><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207015396000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>World peace prayers</name><id>7644919</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207177200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/7644919/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/1/global_622209.jpeg</photo_url></item>
