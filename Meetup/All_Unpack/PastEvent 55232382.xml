Much media focus has been on the campaigning politicians' ideas about ramifications of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)&amp;mdash;future costs, freedom to refuse to participate, hypothetical decisions. The arguments invoke details that vary from intellectual analysis to deeply personal perceptions but are often involved with women. Are there other issues the development of which affect women and men differently? Everyday there are new reports. For our focus there will be materials too numerous to mention here but you will all have ideas about what is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshments will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
