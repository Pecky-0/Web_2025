Do you want to live in strong communities where your rights are respected, and people exercise responsibility for themselves and in their dealings with each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to those questions, then the Free State Project has a solution for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FSP has a huge summer event each year called the Porcupine Freedom Festival at a family campground in Northern New-Hampshire. There will probably be 7-800 people there this year with speakers, music, dances, food, fun, campfires, parties - it's quite an event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year’s Porcupine Freedom Festival is gearing up to become the biggest and most successful so far!
