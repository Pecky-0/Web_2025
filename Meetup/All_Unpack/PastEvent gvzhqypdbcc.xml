&lt;p&gt;Tonight is a speical night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Patch Adams will speak about his belief that laughter, joy and creativity are essential parts of the healing process, and therefore imperative to effective health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace and prosperity!&lt;/p&gt;
