&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are some serious beards.&amp;nbsp; Everyone knows the story about Justin Vernon breaking up with his band (DeYarmond Edison), locking himself in a cabin and recording the first Bon Iver album, right?&amp;nbsp; Well, Megafaun are the rest of that band.&amp;nbsp; And they're &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at Great Scott just after doors open at 9 for drinks before the bands go on.&amp;nbsp; See you there...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megafaun (from Wikipedia):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brothers Brad Cook (bass, guitar) and Phil Cook (keyboards) are from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and Joe Westerlund (percussion) is from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. They first met at the H.O.R.D.E. festival in 1997, and played together in various combinations, including in DeYarmond Edison with Justin Vernon. After that band broke up in 2006, Vernon (Bon Iver) went on to record a solo project (2007's For Emma, Forever Ago), and Westerlund and Brad and Phil Cook formed Megafaun. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Megafaun's first release was Bury the Square in 2008, on which the band were described as "[doing] away with Edison's polite experimentation in favor of full-bore concr&amp;egrave;te music, harsh noise salvos, and wild free-jazz interventions". The group's second album, Gather, Form &amp;amp; Fly, was released in 2009 on the Hometapes label. It was described by Pitchfork Media as "a headily absorbing, occasionally unsettling listen", and by Drowned in Sound as "a tapestry of sound collages and a freedom with form which creates a richly textured whole". A third album, Heretofore, was released in 2010. The self-titled Megafaun was released in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Text/call me on 617-549-8453 when you arrive to find me and the group.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew</member_name><member_id>8828135</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332207864000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327700186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Megafaun @ Great Scott</name><id>49906652</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332118800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/49906652/</event_url></item>
