On Saturday June 1, they are having a photo and tea event - a professional photographer will take individual portraits (you can choose a 5x7 print or a digital photo) and attendees will get 3 tea sandwiches, a scone with fixings, and choice of tea.  All for $35.  If you need a photo for your website, biz card, or your facebook or Linked In page, this is a good opportunity. Let's get dolled up and have some tea and photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU MUST SIGN UP AND PAY IN ADVANCE - SAYING YOU ARE COMING ON THE MEETUP SITE DOES NOT SIGN YOU UP FOR THIS EVENT.&lt;/p&gt;
