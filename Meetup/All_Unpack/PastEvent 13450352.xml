Infusing her deep and melodic songwriting style with splashes of powerful vocals,  her album is described as “modern-day soul” with Vonda’s solid piano playing and soulful, blues-inspired voice driving the tracks.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Historic Town Green is transformed into a festival of crafts, activities, food, live music and much, much more.  &lt;a href="http://www.branfordfestival.com/festinfo.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.branfordfe...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your wine, an appetizer or dessert to share and your lawn chair and settle in for a great evening of music. Concert starts at 8:45 but we will meet at 7:00 to give people a chance to get acquainted or reacquainted! Should be a nice way to start off this summer of concerts!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Yellow and Purple Balloons</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacey</member_name><member_id>7637795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276984049000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273596990000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vonda Shepard  Concert at Branford Fest </name><id>13450352</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276902000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/13450352/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
