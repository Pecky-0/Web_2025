The Open Studio Weekend event is a Hartford city-wide self guided tour that features artists discussing, demonstrating and selling their work at studios, galleries and creative spaces.  In the early years of Open Studio, artists volunteered to manage the event, an unwieldy responsibility for those working full time jobs and making time for their art. Artists in Real Time (ART) was formed to stabilize the event, formalize its marketing and organization, and also to provide additional technical resources to artists to help them promote and sell their work.  ART became incorporated in July 2003 and received its 501Â©3 status in October 2005.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://openstudiohartford.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;Itemid=23" target="_blank"&gt;http://openstudiohart...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>will Wear bw scarf with piano keys =meet in the gallery at 12:30</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy M</member_name><member_id>6563416</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290128075000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Arts  lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Arts-Cultural-Events</urlname><id>1343414</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Arts &amp; Creative Cultural Events</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285633166000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>21st Annual Open Studio Weekend in Hartford</name><id>14918158</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289669400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Arts-Cultural-Events/events/14918158/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/6/global_18313798.jpeg</photo_url></item>
