<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Thursday nights at the ICA are free, sponsored by Target. I will lead a small group and we spend about 1/2 hour seeking out the digital art works in the ICA's collection. Afterwards, we can find a table in the museum's cafe for a drink or snack. We will meet at 7 pm and will be finished around 8 or 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ICA is located near the Courthouse MBTA stop (Take the silverline one stop from South Station). Parking is available nearby.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the highlights we will view:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Exit Strategy&amp;quot; Video, Catherine D'Ignazio. The artist records herself walking the ICA evacuation routes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Hunt&amp;quot; Video, Christian Jankowski. Segments from a week long quest to eat only groceries shot in the supermarket with a bow and arrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oil and Sugar #2&amp;quot; Video, Kader Attia. Hypnotic video of sugar cubes slowly dissolved by motor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;1st Light&amp;quot; Animation, Paul Chan. Projected images of silhouetted figures drift downward across the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Suzanne walking in a leather skirt&amp;quot; Animation, Julian Opie. Minimalist animation captures the style of an individual's movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other artworks worth checking out are a photography and film exhibit about Loch Ness Monster imagery, &amp;quot;Hanging Fire,&amp;quot; a 3D sculpture constructed from charred wood, and &amp;quot;Czech Modernism Mirror and Reflected Infinitely,&amp;quot; a display of Czech art using lighting and mirror tricks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Directions and details for meeting will be emailed to participants on Wed.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235523397000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234626002000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Night at the ICA Museum - Update</name><id>9740714</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235088000000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/9740714/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
