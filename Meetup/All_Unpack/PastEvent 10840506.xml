We are looking at starting a casual game league to support the new core edition.  The idea is that everyone buys a starter and two boosters and this is their base of cards to play with.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every month when we get together everyone will get THREE sealed booster packs and we will do a rotating draft with the boosters giving everyone a chance to add cards to their collection at a very low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the idea we came up with to try and get new players to show up and play, we want to have a fun league without people spending big bucks to make killer decks, $10 a month seems reasonable when you get to keep the cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know what you think about this idea, we can adjust it to fit the needs of the players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wizards of the Coast have supplied special DCI foil promo cards to give out at the Friday Night Magic event, swing by and pick up your Slave of Bolas and Marisi's Twinclaws cards.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Szewczyk</member_name><member_id>4695834</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250032140000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247166563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Magic - Magic the Gathering 2010 League</name><id>10840506</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249682400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/10840506/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/9/global_9572569.jpeg</photo_url></item>
