Apparently, they are engaged in a price war with a competing restaurant and had to lower their price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you're more than welcome to order from the a la carte menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oliveira's is clean, the food fresh, the prices very reasonable....prices are less than the online menu below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oliveirasrestaurant.com/everett.html" target="_blank"&gt;Check out the Oliveira's Restaurant menu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lovely music of Receita de Samba will begin around 8:00 PM. I always enjoy Anna's and Bill's shows and I'm sure you will as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/receitadesamba" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to the music of Receita de Samba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Transit: &lt;br /&gt;Orange Line subway to Sullivan Station then &lt;br /&gt;Bus 109 Linden Sq Via Broadway then &lt;br /&gt;get off at Broadway &amp;amp; Gladstone Terrace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://portuguese.meetup.com/316/calendar/10475963/"&gt;Portuguese Meetup &lt;/a&gt; will be joining us as well, so perhaps you'll pick up a few words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Before I list the Rules of Engagement please understand the NO-SHOW policy was established to ensure everyone who wants to join can and it will be fairly and strictly enforced.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to assure you I do understand if you've RSVPd YES and you have a sudden change of plans because you're lost, you don't feel well, you have transportation issues, you don't have the money, or you just don't want to be around people. My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules for Engagement for Events with &lt;u&gt;Reservations&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at 617 445-7549.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVPs are on a first come, first served basis.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment requesting to be placed on wait list.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If dinner is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will automatically be changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the dinner and you have not attended, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I change you're RSVP to NO because you haven't replied to final update dinner confirmation email deadline, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW each will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within twenty-four hours of the dinner, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email Tonya about rejoining.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will arrive at 7:00 PM to confirm seating and welcome you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya/Meetup reservation or call/text my cell (617) 445 7549</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262099403000</updated><rating><average>4.11000013351</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243187056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oliveira's Restaurant - Dinner and Music Saturday June 13th  8:00 PM</name><id>10482764</id><headcount>33</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244937600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/10482764/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/8/c/global_8855004.jpeg</photo_url></item>
