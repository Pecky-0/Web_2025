The trail is very well maintained and even has a few rest stops if needed.&lt;br /&gt; Finders Pub has a great assortment of food and drinks plus free peanuts and pop corn!&lt;br /&gt;So break out your hiking shoes and bring a camea.&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make the hike, join us at Finders Pub. (Call my cell so I can give you an ETA) (508)212-4111.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finders Pub is located at 171 West Boylston St. in West Boylston Their phone number is (508)835-3707&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: If it's going to be raining on Saturday the rain date will be Sunday (same time).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the one riding the Black Suzuki Burgman (Scooter)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>3673693</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222210138000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219675979000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike on The Mass Central Rail Trail</name><id>8616159</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221922800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/8616159/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/7/global_4038951.jpeg</photo_url></item>
