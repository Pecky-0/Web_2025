The December restaurant of the month will be at Piccola Italia Ristorante.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About The Restaurant of the Month:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni and Rosa Paolini's goal was to open a truly authentic Italian restaurant in Manchester, NH.  Rosa Paolini is originally from Bari, Italy and she brings her culture to the restaurant.  Her focus is to bring a true Italian feeling to the restaurant.  From the hand painted &amp;quot;Benvenuti&amp;quot; sign as you walk in, to the Italian paintings on the walls, there is a feeling of Italy all around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni has been surrounded by rich Italian culture all his life.  His mother is from Sicily, ITaly and his father is from Abruzzo, Italy.  Giovanni started in the restaurant business in the North End as a dishwasher in 1979.  He made his way from dishwasher to chief chef and now prides himself as serving modest meals at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Menu:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.piccolaitalianh.com/eng/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.piccolaita...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert</member_name><member_id>4121028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230342842000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225544606000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FAN Restaurant of the Month  </name><id>9070922</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229817600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/9070922/</event_url></item>
