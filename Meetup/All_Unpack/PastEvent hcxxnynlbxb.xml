Current ideas are putting together an event  in which we have speakers from fashion companies that are trying to make a positive impact in the world. One example is American Apparel that seems to be making a difference by keeping their jobs in the US rather than using cheap labor from overseas and wants to give back to the community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.americanapparel.net/verticalintegration/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.americanap...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also talk about designers/manufacturers who are making a difference by employing people from impoverished regions and economically helping them maintain a living such as Eileen Fisher and  other boutique firms such as Lem Lem.&lt;br /&gt;A member of the group suggested the following agenda item:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; I was reading an article about SEWA, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/fashion/22Gimlet.html?_r=2&amp;amp;ref=fashion" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nytimes.co...&lt;/a&gt; in the Ny Times, I was thinking that about how many crafts are used as curiosities and the women are not given their fair share. If any one knows of companies that actually have fashion forward ethnic crafts I think that would be a great topic.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Ranere</member_name><member_id>975035</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan</member_name><member_id>2523024</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>yasu</member_name><member_id>3356319</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer Ngo</member_name><member_id>9863902</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1282196381000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>fashionandmusic</urlname><id>1390310</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Fashion and Music Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279636675000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fashion and Music Networking</name><id>hcxxnynlbxb</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282168800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fashionandmusic/events/14157107/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/1/6/global_12633862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
