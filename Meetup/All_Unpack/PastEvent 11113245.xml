Creationism: Science you can bank on.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Christian ministry Calvary Chapel in the City has organized a public lecture by Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson, on the topic of Creationism. I think this is a good opportunity for members, many of whom I know have strong feelings about the use of scientific knowledge to combat untruths or confusion, to learn more about how the tenets of the religious doctrive known as Creationism are presented to the public. I plan to bring a stack of primary-source literature, as I do when I attend such events, in order to have such information at hand in case anyone I might be chatting with would like to learn more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this kind of event may attract persons who have a conception of non-religious people that isn't accurate, this is also a good chance to introduce them to a less stereotyped view of their secular neighbors. Let's turn their worldview upside down by being gracious, respectful, informed, and gregarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accessible via the Green Line Longwood stop (D line). Parking is available at the Conference Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: Christian band begins 30 min before each lecture. &lt;br /&gt;For more information, email ccitc@calvarychapelinthecity.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250811163000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250278111000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Plumbing the Depths: An Investigation into Creationism</name><id>11113245</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250463600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/11113245/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/a/global_10149754.jpeg</photo_url></item>
