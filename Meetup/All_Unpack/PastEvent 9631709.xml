Bring prints or laptops to show us your work! Bring something to share with the group... we want to see your projects, your photographs, your latest and greatest image making... Share it this night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also have someone taking photos of you all so there are no excuses for you not have a photo on this web site. Having a photo in your profile benefits the rest of us. WE will recognize you at our events. So if you don't have a photo of yourself- we'll have someone taking photos this night to rectify that... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Scott and I are always to try to greet everyone who comes to the meetups.
