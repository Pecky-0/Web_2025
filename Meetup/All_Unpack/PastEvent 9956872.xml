The race starts at Artesani Park which is on the Brighton side of the Charles River near the Public Theater. There is a huge lot for parking but you can also jog there in 15 minutes from Harvard Square. The race is a fast, flat loop around the Charles River with t-shirts for the first 300 that sign up and Marathon Sports gift certificates for the top age group finishers and raffles. Any suggestions for breakfast snacks for 400 people are welcome! You can sign up at the race until 9:45am but its easier for everyone is you sign up via Active.com at &lt;a href="http://www.active.com/page/Event_Details.htm?event_id=1680998" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.active.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the race director running around like crazy</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael McHugh</member_name><member_id>1987659</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242171254000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237095863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>4th Annual Architecture for Humanity Boston 5K</name><id>9956872</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241964000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/9956872/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
