<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Time for a change of pace and venue for Trivia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of us scouted out the Trivia at Ri Ra a few weeks ago and liked what we saw.  Lets try it with a larger group and see how it goes!  The questions are bit more diverse than at Union Station, and there's no music to shout over (or be deafened by).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying you aren't any good at trivia is no excuse not to come to the weekly trivia night at Union Station. Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows something about the world and can make a great contribution to the game as well as to the conversations around the tables while we play. Come on out, socialize with the easiest group of people you'll ever make friends with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game is supposed to start at 8:30 and should take under 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we take first prize, it will be applied towards a future event at Ri Ra.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a sign and try to stake out a couple of tables in the "stage"</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240710772000</updated><rating><average>2.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238181463000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ Ri Ra</name><id>10051000</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240358400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/10051000/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
