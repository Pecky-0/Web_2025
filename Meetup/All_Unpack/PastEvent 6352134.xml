Approximate trip time is 2 to 3 hours, comfort/skill level of group will determine how far we paddle - if everyone is up for a longer paddle we can paddle across the pond (it's big), if not, we'll turn around when we get to the pond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Rt. 9 to Rt. 148 South - It's 0.6 miles from Rt. 9 to the boat launch, which will be on the left, just before the river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Rt. 20 to Rt. 148 North - It's 6.9 miles from Rt. 20 to the boat launch, which will be on the right just after driving over the river.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191351741000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189700753000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak Quaboag River - ON SITE RENTALS available</name><id>6352134</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191164400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/6352134/</event_url></item>
