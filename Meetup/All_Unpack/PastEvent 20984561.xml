They're very good - they play everything from rock to folk to alternative to country...whatever you want, they can play it. I never heard of them before &amp;amp; wasn't expecting any music the night I was there. I was pleasantly surprised! I'm going back on June 11th with a friend or two...martinis are great, food is good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam</member_name><member_id>9912044</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307847581000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307225096000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live band "Cool Change" - music, food, martinis at Ab Fab in Melrose</name><id>20984561</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307833200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/20984561/</event_url></item>
