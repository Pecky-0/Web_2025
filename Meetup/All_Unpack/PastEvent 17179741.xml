Known and beloved by most New Yorkers, and with an international following in the paper and on-line. Bill has been likened to Garbo in that, until now, no one has known a thing about him. Intensely private, and with an aversion to any kind of recognition."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official site for the film is here:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://zeitgeistfilms.com/billcunninghamnewyork/"&gt;http://zeitgeistfilms.com/billcunninghamnewyork/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually RAW's films are at 7:30pm, I will update the week before when the times are posted.&amp;nbsp; I've set our Meetup time a few minutes before, but if you come on time there are trailers for their coming films.&amp;nbsp; Here is the RAW site, including reviews of the film:&lt;/p&gt;
