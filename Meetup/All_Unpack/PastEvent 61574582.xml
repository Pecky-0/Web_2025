&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE ORGANIZER: Toni Bee was elected to her position by Cambridge residents in 2011.

Toni Bee was born in Boston from middle-class parents, but ended up single mom and homeless. Now, she works and lives in Cambridge (Area 4). She is a writer, photographer, student at Simmons College, and mother to her ten-year-old daughter. Toni Bee is a neighbor media journalist at Cambridge Community Television (CCTV). In 2001, she was honored by the YWCA with an “Outstanding Woman” award for her advocacy and commitment to the arts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336234968000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335054433000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Poetry Jam</name><id>61574582</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336230000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/61574582/</event_url></item>
