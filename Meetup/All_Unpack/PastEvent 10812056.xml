It's been a long time since we have met there but looking forward to it. Wanted to speak with all of our members plus welcome any new ones that we have. Obviously there have been a ton of changes recently and I want to speak with all of you on that. I would like to have maximum participation in this outing if possible. I'm looking forward to really getting out there and doing something new with the group and would like to hear all of your feedback. It's going to take some leg work from every member on here to accomplish new and better things for the group. I will explain and talk more when we meet this Thursday for dinner. I look forward to seeing all of you : )&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call or text me 860-919-9782</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249944050000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246889596000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A New Beginning</name><id>10812056</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247185800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10812056/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/global_9384259.jpeg</photo_url></item>
