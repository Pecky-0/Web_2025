&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATC jams are cards that have been worked on by more than one person. Typically the way we do it is to have a set of three cards that three people work on and then they each get one to keep. At every monthly meetup we have a self-service "jam jar" available - but it can be loads of fun to work on in person! We've done this a couple of times before, and it is always exhilarating to go home with these exciting new cards. There's a sort of alchemy that happens in these sessions; jam cards have a strange "more than the sum of their parts" look to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIME:&lt;/strong&gt; 1pm to 5pm. Come when you want, stay as long as you like during this timeframe. If any jams you've worked on are not completed when you have to leave, they will go into the jam jar at the regular meetup and we will get your card to you as soon as it's completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; A small collection of your favorite supplies for ATC-making: backgrounds you've already prepped (painted, stamped, etc), some focal elements like images from collage sheets or rubber stamps, and embellishing tools like colored pencils, crackle medium, or words for found poetry. These are just suggestions, bring what you are comfortable working with. Space is limited and ArtStudio 360 is on the second floor with no elevator, so please limit yourself to one small craft caddy or bag. As always there are some shared supplies available as well. Don't forget to bring a snack and beverage of your choice, this much art can be tiring and you'll need sustenance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt; $20 cash, &lt;span&gt;regardless of how long you stay. This fee helps keep ArtStudio 360 open, so we can't accept IOUs or partial payments; please plan to pay when you arrive. We're happy to direct you to a nearby ATM if you need it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.) and some supplies including acrylic paints, collage materials, embellishments, paper and more. Access to a microwave, toaster oven, refrigerator, kitchen sink and restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone (18+ only, please). Just RSVP through the NE ATC+ Meetup Group. Membership in the Meetup group is free; joining simply allows you to reserve a space in events at ArtStudio 360.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt; These smaller sessions often fill quickly. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly so that your space becomes available to someone else. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; In the unlikely event that we need to cancel due to bad weather or other reasons---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW POLICY REGARDING RSVPs:&lt;/strong&gt; Your RSVP is a reservation, and we're trusting that you'll honor it. If you can't make it, please change your RSVP from "yes" to "no" before the event start time. Everybody forgets once in awhile, but repeated no-shows--people who RSVP "yes" but then don't show up--may be asked to pay in advance for future events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow, that was a ton of fun! I think I must have been jamming for something like six solid hours! You guys are the best. I just love the energy of bouncing ideas off each other, sharing supplies and tools, and creating these magical collaborative pieces. :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was a great afternoon of sharing ideas, materials and comradery. I can't wait to do it again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was one of the best!! Lots of energy, lots of laughs, and at least 25 sets of jams finished...I can hardly wait for the next one!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
