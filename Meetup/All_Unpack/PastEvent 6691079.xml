I was at the one in Framingham and we loved it.  This is what they wrote for ladies night.    &amp;quot;Catch up with the girls for an evening of fun and interactive fondue! In addition to our discounted Girls' Night menu, we'll be featuring psychic mediums, palmists, chair massages, manicures, handbags, jewelry, skin care products and more. &amp;quot;  If you would like to see a medium or do any of the other fun things listed, you can make a reservation by calling them and telling them you are coming at 7pm.  Go look at &lt;a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/locations.aspx?z=&amp;amp;n=755445" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.meltingpot...&lt;/a&gt;  This will give you idea of price and tell you about the vendors.  Men, you can come if you want but not sure the men will get the same deal we ladies are getting :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another reason I am scheduling this.  I'm asking people, who said they would be interested in donating to a needy child for the holidays, to bring the gift that night.  I then will pass it on to the woman who is handling this.  She gave me the &amp;quot;wish list&amp;quot; of these children.  I will put the list on here.  If you want to donate, in your response, please write what you are bringing for which child.  Even better if you wrap it and put the child's name on it.  Once someone has claimed a child and a gift, please don't duplicate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish List&lt;br /&gt;Paola- girl age 10 - Long Chapter books, 5th grade level (likes adventure stories)   (Gail)&lt;br /&gt;                               Winter coat size 14/16 girls..brown or burgundy, dark color     {Anne)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joham - boy age 11 - Clothes, Shirts (med), pants (30), &lt;br /&gt;                                   winter coat (size M) men sizes     (Sandy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mario - boy age 6 - Winter coat size 8-10     (Lucy)&lt;br /&gt;                               Spiderman Ultimate Web Blaster&lt;br /&gt;                               Uno Card Games            (Lucy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joaquim- boy - Celtics or Red Sox clothes and hats (Size M/L men)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sikira - age 10 girl -  Arts and crafts stuff    (Mary Ellen)&lt;br /&gt;                                Hat and gloves&lt;br /&gt;                                Boots size 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sikayla - age 7 girl - hat and gloves      (Janet)&lt;br /&gt;                                Boots size 2          (Janet)&lt;br /&gt;                                Leotards (girls size 10)  (Janet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyaisha - girl age 1  Size 24 months clothes, pj's (loves Dora the Explora)    (Joan) (Bernice)&lt;br /&gt;                                Hat and mittens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                 &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198340369000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
