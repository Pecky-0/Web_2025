<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello, I'm one of Tom's assistant organizers, and I'm planning a meetup to see &amp;quot;Va Savoir&amp;quot; by Jacques Rivette.  At the end of the film, I will hold up a sign near the front of the theatre that says &amp;quot;Meetup&amp;quot; on it.  If you RSVPed (Is that really a verb?) &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; please join me and we'll go to a local establishment for refreshments and conversation.  My name is Susan, and if you want to get an idea of what I look like, click on my name under Asst. Organizers to the left of your screen.  If you want more information than just the address to the Harvard Film Archive, go to their website at hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/ and click on &amp;quot;general info&amp;quot; and then &amp;quot;directions&amp;quot; which will also include information on parking as well as how to find it.  The following review was taken off their website, and you can get more information about Rivette and his other films there also.  As you will see, it is showing at two different times, but I am only hosting the Friday night time.  Please also notice that it is 154 minutes long so that you can plan accordingly.  If you RSVP &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; and then find out you cannot come, please change it to a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; so someone else can take your place.  Thank-you and I look forward to meetingup with you and having a lively discussion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 16 (Friday) 8 pm&lt;br /&gt;February 18 (Sunday) 7 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Va Savoir &lt;br /&gt;Directed by Jacques Rivette&lt;br /&gt;France 2001, 35mm, color, 154 min.&lt;br /&gt;With Jeanne Balibar, Marianne Basler, Sergio Castellitto&lt;br /&gt;French with English subtitles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rivette explores the intersecting lives of six characters in his latest tableau of theatrical life. Jeanne Balibar stars as Camille, the lead actress of an Italian stage production who has returned to Paris after three years and must confront her newly married ex-boyfriend. Her current lover Ugo is the director of the play and is unaware of her conflict, largely due to his own preoccupation with the search for a missing eighteenth-century Italian manuscript. He enlists the aid of a mysterious but alluring student who helps him in his quest but also has complicated entanglements which tie her to both Camille and Ugo. Va savoir leisurely weaves together its alluring characters in one of Rivette?s lighter and most enjoyable works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171847474000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169823923000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jacques Rivette film at the Harvard Film Archive!!</name><id>5427169</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171674000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5427169/</event_url></item>
