Well, at least the book we're reading should be full of that stuff. For July's meetup, we're reading The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon. I've always wanted to read this one because it's such an intriguing premise and is sure to generate a lively discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're doing things slightly different this time as we're meeting on a Thursday instead of a Wednesday and we're also meeting in the 3rd week of the month instead of the 4th week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, we're sticking to our pattern of trying a new place for the meeting. This time, it's at Republic in Manchester, which I've been dying to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 person cap still applies, so RSVP as quickly as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, come out, have a beer, discuss a book, and otherwise be social.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279895455000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277517118000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Look to your left, look to your right.
