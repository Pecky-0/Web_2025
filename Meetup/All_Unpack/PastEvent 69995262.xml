Please join us at the MFA for a PlayDate (hosted by the MFA). We have gone several times and each time, my daughter enjoys more and more of the exhibits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a story time held in an exhibit space related to the art theme or the month. Then a crafty art project for the kids. We also stay for lunch and take in a couple more exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I host this meetup event from another meetup as well. So I will let us know the total count when finalized! We will meet at the 'Christmas Tree' like sculpture in the Shapiro Visitor center before getting assigned into a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pack a lunch for the kiddos unless you want to try the cafeteria. There's a cute cafe near the bookstore in the MFA where I like to have lunch with my girl! The activity ends by 11:30 but you are all invited to stay for lunch with us and take in more exhibits afterward!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342452814000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340216045000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MFA PlayDate for Babies, Tots &amp; Preschoolers</name><id>69995262</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>4500000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342448100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/69995262/</event_url></item>
