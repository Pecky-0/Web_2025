Together, they mount his ascent and her comeback, which leads to romantic complications involving her husband/manager (McGraw) and a beauty queen-turned-singer (Meester).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE USUAL STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet right inside the theater ticket lobby doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome, just be sure to include them in the RSVP so that I know who/how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP as up-to-date as possible. And please call me if you're going to be late or need to change your RSVP after I close RSVPs on the site (2 hours before we meet). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll head to a restaurant to chat about the movie (and just chat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll update the time a few days before the meetup, so keep an eye on your email!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you for there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Michelle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7:25, so let's meet in the lobby at 6:55 pm to buy tickets and head inside. I will check RSVPs for the last time around 5 pm. If you change your RSVP after that or if you are running late, please call 978-857-3734.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send my cell and be wear a silver down coat (it's winter!).</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michelle</member_name><member_id>2132838</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295378872000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294399852000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Country Strong</name><id>15956289</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295308800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/15956289/</event_url></item>
