Lots of people out on the street, music, food, etc. We will attempt to capture that feeling in pictures: afternoon/evening light, long exposures, creative use of flash, etc. Bring whatever portable lighting gear you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we're tired, cold, and hungry we'll choose a place to have dinner and share photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the event page on the day in case you have any doubt that it's going to be a warm summer evening. I'll also send my cell phone number to those who RSVP Yes or Maybe for the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are not familiar with Portsmouth, the High-Hanover Parking Garage is a cheap and convenient place to park. The Hanover St. entrance is on the garage's 2nd level. (There is a public restroom here.) Take the stairs or elevator down one level and exit on the opposite side, then walk down High St. to Market Square and cross the street to the North Church.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221929845000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219926567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portsmouth NH Nightlife</name><id>8639148</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220737500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/8639148/</event_url></item>
