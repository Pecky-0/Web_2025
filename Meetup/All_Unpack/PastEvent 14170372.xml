<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Plan is to meet at the &amp;quot;Randolph East&amp;quot; trailhead on Dolly Copp Road just off of route 2.   For a nice illustration of the location relative to route 2 and narby trailheads, please check &lt;a href="http://www.randolphmountainclub.org/trailsinfo/trailheads.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.randolphmo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will ascend to Mount Madison via the Howker Ridge Trail which joins the Osgood Trail .3 miles below the summit of Madison.   We will then descend to Madison Hut, snack, get water, etc and then descend.  We can re-consider our route for descent (there are many options) and I have outlined  a &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; option below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Ascent&lt;/span&gt;:  4.5 miles, 4350 elevation gain -  4 hr 25 minutes book time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Descent&lt;/span&gt; via Madison Hut, on Valley Way to Lower Bruin, to Watson Path, Brookside, Kelton and back to Howker Ridge - about 4.2 miles and 3 hr 50 minutes book time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate totals:  8.7 miles, 4350 elevation gain, 8 hr 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Weather Contingency&lt;/span&gt;:  If it looks to me like the weather will be particularly worrisome for Friday, I will move to a plan B to hike Owl's Head.  Right now the weather  forecast for Friday is looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pace: Moderate.  I start with the notion of doing the trip within an hour of book time (allowing for one long break and a number of smaller ones). I'm fine with going a little faster, especially if late afternoon thundershowers are forecast or a little slower if that's the pace the group is comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: This is challenging hike.  We will be going above treeline, so you must come prepared for bad weather.   In August, 1986, a hiker died of exposure and hypothermia on Madison.  Other summer hikers on Madison have found themselves in life threatening situations.   Most, if not all, of these situations could have been avoided with reasonable precautions which is why proper preparation and knowledge is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Necessary equipment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Headlamp (or flashlight) with spare batteries, or a second headlamp/flashlight. &lt;br /&gt;• Clothing: Light-weight to mid-weight synthetic shirt/pants - no jeans or cotton. Cotton does not insulate well when wet. Windy ridge conditions can compound this. &lt;br /&gt;• Outerwear: Light-weight to mid-weight waterproof rain jacket (with hood) and something (even a fleece vest) to wear for extra insulation if needed. &lt;br /&gt;• Food and Water: High-energy snacks and at least two quarts of water.&lt;br /&gt;• Other Gear: Sunscreen and insect repellent. &lt;br /&gt;• Trail hardy Footwear. &lt;br /&gt;* Anything else your experience, judgment or research tells you that you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information please look for the list of 10 essentials, other gear and the Hiker Responsibility Code at &lt;a href="http://www.hikesafe.c..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hikesafe.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Car Pooling – I’m leaving from the Porter/Davis area near the Cambridge Somerville Line. Please let me know if you are interested in carpooling or would like a ride (I will be taking a dog). Lets save some gas money and shrink our carbon footprint! If you have a ride to offer or need a ride please post your needs or availability on your RSVP.  Please note your interest in giving or getting a ride and contact hikers directly if their posts or profiles indicate it might be convenient to share rides with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;This trip is cross posted with the Boston Hiking Group (thus my plus 6)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs: We have as many dogs on the trip as is reasonable.   Please contact me before signing on (if you haven't already signed on) and you wish to bring a dog.   I can let you know if someone who planned on bringing a dog cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;MY DISCLAIMER: MY ROLE AS ORGANIZER IN THIS HIKE IS SOCIAL. I AM NOT TRAINED TO BE A GUIDE, NOR HAVE I RECEIVED TRAINING OR INSTRUCTION IN HIKING SAFETY. WHILE I TRY TO HEAD OFF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. IF MY DISAPPEARANCE DURING THIS TRIP WOULD CAUSE YOU MORE THAN ANNOYANCE AND INCONVENIENCE, THIS IS NOT THE TRIP FOR YOU. THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS IN HIKING IN THE MOUNTAINS. IF YOU ARE NOT CONFIDENT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS, PLEASE DO NOT SIGN UP (or change your RSVP to no). I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF MAKING STUPID OR MINDLESS MISTAKES, SO PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND COME PREPARED WITH APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE, EQUIPMENT AND JUDGMENT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for more information on dangers encountered hiking on Madison, please check out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ohcroo.com/pdf/spring2001.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ohcroo.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917636,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.time.com/t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be there with a black dog and a crumbling red Ford Taurus</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David (Ped Xing)</member_name><member_id>4566112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279984174000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279733842000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Madison via Howker's Ridge </name><id>14170372</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279890000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14170372/</event_url></item>
