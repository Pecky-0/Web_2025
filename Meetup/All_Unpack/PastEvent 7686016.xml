We invite you to get together with our group to do some guided meditation and have some discussion about what the meditation experience is like and how to go deeper in our practice. This is also a great introduction for those who would like to begin a spiritual meditation practice and want to know how to start. We also read something from a mystic in one of the world religions and have some conversation about how is it relevant to us in our modern lives. It is an evening of warmth and connecting with others who are interested in real conversation and meaningful spiritual experience.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all!&lt;br /&gt;In peace,&lt;br /&gt;Rev.
