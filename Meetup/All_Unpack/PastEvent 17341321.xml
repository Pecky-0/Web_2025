&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of organizing a weekend golf trip if there is interest and the logistics can be worked out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 20th&amp;nbsp;they're offering their super saver rate of $100 per person double occupancy ($150 single) plus taxes and/or service charges.&amp;nbsp; This includes lodging for two nights,&amp;nbsp;three meals, 1/2 price green fees as well as 99 cent beer, popcorn &amp;amp; sundaes.&amp;nbsp; (Fri's dinner is optional at $12).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at Poland Springs several years back.&amp;nbsp; Although not&amp;nbsp;fancy, its clean, very comfortable and relaxing - their motto is "stress free zone" and it really is.&amp;nbsp; The golf course was great and was written up at some point in Golf Digest in their best courses to play.&amp;nbsp;It has beautiful views, a large veranda with seats overlooking the valley, nightly entertainment, a social/great room area and&amp;nbsp;a bar.&amp;nbsp; It's a good weekend getaway - just not fancy.&amp;nbsp; Meals are buffet style, and good but pretty standard.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would suggest staying at the Maine Inn as that is where everything happens and is most convenient.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that may be inviting non-golfers the inn/area offers many other things -hiking, biking, tennis, antiques, art galleries, Shaker Village, Wildlife Park, Gardens, LL Bean Outlet, flea markets&amp;nbsp;- see their website for a more complete list and details.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested, I've attached a short questionnaire to help coordiante things - such as room assignments, T times, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check out there web site (polandspringsinn.com)and let me know if you have any interest.&amp;nbsp; I think it would be a great weekend get away all for the price of a high end golf course at home.&amp;nbsp; I guessing for 2 nights lodging, dinner, 2 breakfasts and 2 rounds of golf at about $150 for the weekend plus whatever anyone else wants.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
