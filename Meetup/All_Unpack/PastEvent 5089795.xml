<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>At very short notice there will be an impromptu game of backyard cricket this Saturday in Brookline.  If you are like me and suffering withdrawl symptoms from lack of leather on willow then join us for a casual hit and giggle.  Afterwards we'll adjourn to Matt Murphy's pub in Brookline Village for a blow by blow analysis, some slow motion replays and a warm down pint.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW the location marked on the map is wrong but I can't change it.  The park is on the corner of Brookline Ave and Aspinwall Ave)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159919993000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156204753000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Backyard cricket</name><id>5089795</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156618800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/5089795/</event_url></item>
