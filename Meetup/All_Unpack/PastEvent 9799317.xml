There are a number of trails of varying levels of difficulty but we'll stay with the less strenuous ones. We can decide when we meet.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you turn into the road leading to the reservation, there is a parking lot on your right in front of a skating rink and one further up in front of the Visitor Center. Let's meet on the &amp;quot;porch&amp;quot; of the Visitor Center at 11:00. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I'm game for lunch or at least coffee. Kelly's is right down the street or we can pick another place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm regards, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy G &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;From north or south: Take Rte. 1 to Lynn Fells Parkway exit, follow Lynn Fells Parkway a short distance, take a right onto Forest Street. Park entrance is after Kasabuski Rink.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Kathy and her wheaton terrier (change if I got that wrong, Kathy!)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236528173000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235349711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Breakheart Reservation in Saugus</name><id>9799317</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235836800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/9799317/</event_url></item>
