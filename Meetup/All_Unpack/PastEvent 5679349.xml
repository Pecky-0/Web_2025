<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Join us for the inaugural meeting of the the New England ATC Meetup Group on Saturday, May 5, starting at 1 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Thayer Public Library in Braintree to swap cards and talk about what we'd like to do in future meetups -- and where else we might hold them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thayer Public Library is at 798 Washington St., Braintree, MA 02184. Check the Web site for driving directions (www.thayerpubliclibrary.org) or do a Mapquest. You can park free behind the building, or, if that lot is full, on one of the surrounding streets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The library is also walking distance from the Red Line and Commuter Rail Braintree stops. I'll post some walking directions from the T station before our meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be in Conference Room A, which is upstairs, just outside the Children's Library. I'll try to post a few signs directing you where to go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring your ATC-making friends, BUT I need a head count, so please, please, please RSVP with names. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll bring some beverages (water, soda). If anyone would like to bring some light, non-messy munchies, that would be great. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it for now! Please let me know if you can make it. I'm very much looking forward to getting our group off the ground at last, and to meeting all of you in person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178557715000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176817223000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New England ATC Group's First Meet &amp; Swap</name><id>5679349</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178384400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/5679349/</event_url></item>
