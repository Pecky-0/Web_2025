Service is sometimes a little slow, but 'hit them up' in the local language, and they'll rush food right out to you, ahead of everyone else.  Alternatively, smile &amp;quot;sheepishly&amp;quot; at them, and they're likely to do the same thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;* Quantities (of their food) are VERY &amp;quot;ample&amp;quot; (enough to satisfy a hungry person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's 11:30 am (to goad us all to 12 noon - but PLEASE aim for 11:30 am) through 2 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, on November 6th, we'll take a jaunt through Chinatown (and the Mandarin Chinese Meetup members can show the rest of the assembly - the folks from the Vegan Meetup Group) the sites, as we go over to hear Gish Jen at 3:30 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's POSSIBLE to attend only for the sociables around food - vegan food - Asian vegan food, and we hope that the additional activities at the end won't deter from attending any of those who might have time only for the social lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get along quite well in the context of the biweekly Dinners with Dharma at GBBCC; we might like each other in these contexts, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the DOs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do aim to enjoy yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do bring yourself (do think of bringing a friend or two)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do aim for 11:30 am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do overlook any faults in the host site's decor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do bring your digital camera&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do upload afterwards your digital photos of the event&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do bring 'something vegan to share' with others - be creative!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Vegan' as an adjective applied to food means no animal ingredients - no flesh, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy, honey, or animal by products (probably no sugar unless vegan sugar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there - not just ONCE, but each month thereafter back here in Chinatown, Boston.  &lt;br /&gt;And consider staying ALL -DAY for the monthly 'vegan all-day with BVA'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think we SHOULD have any other social event (other than those already scheduled through another local vegetarian or vegan resource), we will consider all good suggestions that bring vegan organizing energy to the suggestion - perhaps at Veggie Planet or another all-veggie place or at someone's home..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do let me know by e-mail at Maynard.Clark@GMail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in any case, PLEASE ANSWER THE SEVERAL FUN QUESTION(S) AT THE END !!  please...  And if they've provoked you to think, please research them and bring your thoughts to our meetings.  Hey!  We want to TALK with you AS WELL as to SEE you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always bring your digital camera(s) [so you can upload YOUR photos to the Meetup website after the meetup] and ONE 'vegan' IDEA, news item, object - &amp;quot;shareable thing&amp;quot; to share (one 'vegan thing' per person) - could be a current vegan news issue or item (even if not made explicit by the press or media), a concern, a vegan food item to show around, a cruelty-free clothing item to share and show, or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maynard&lt;br /&gt;617-571-4794 (cell) does NOT answer any 'anonymous' phone calls with called ID blanked out &lt;br /&gt;(nor should you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the management</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maynard S.
