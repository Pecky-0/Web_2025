<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Moms! I am new to the area and just had a baby girl 3 months ago. I was hoping to find other Russian families with young children in the Newton area who would be interested in getting together weekly. I am trying to raise my daughter bilingual so want her to hear russian language more often. Kids can play and moms would enjoy tea and conversation. I am happy to host the first playgroup! (I can have 4-5 moms at my house).&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330528389000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Russian Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>expatrussian-64</urlname><id>1112191</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Families with Russian Kids, Moms Club, Playgroups</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327931977000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Playgroup for Moms/Babies Age 0-12months</name><id>50211272</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330455600000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/expatrussian-64/events/50211272/</event_url></item>
