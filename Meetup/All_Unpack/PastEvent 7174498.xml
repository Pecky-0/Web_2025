The idea is to have bi-monthly meetups for lunches/dinners/coffee houses etc..so we can chat and enjoy each other's company.  We welcome and urge new members to join us.  Casual setting, cheap eats and a fun time is guaranteed. The first Cheat Eats meetup is set for THIS Sunday.  See details.  Limit is 15 members.  Please RSVP yes or no only. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hostesses:  Helen and Karen.  Hopefully someone else in the group will want&lt;br /&gt;to take a turn next time or make a suggestion for a good place to meet and continue with this theme.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201626650000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><why>This is a great new idea for Sunday afternoon socials where friends can gather to eat, chat and get to know each other better.
