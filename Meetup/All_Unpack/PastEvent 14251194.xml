This is a &lt;br /&gt; jumping point for any photographer.&lt;br /&gt; In the past we’ve had people with $500&lt;br /&gt; dollar cameras to $30 thousand dollar &lt;br /&gt;cameras come in  and shoot side by side. &lt;br /&gt;The Great Model shoot is a great place to ask&lt;br /&gt; questions and learn about new techniques&lt;br /&gt; and network or build up your  portfolio. &lt;br /&gt;If you’re on the other end of things such as&lt;br /&gt; designers, make-up artists &amp;amp; hair stylists; &lt;br /&gt;you get to build your portfolio as well by &lt;br /&gt; networking and getting photos of your work.&lt;br /&gt; Models will also get to build their  portfolio &lt;br /&gt;and network with other models and photographers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ve adjusted the price to compensate for&lt;br /&gt; studio rental and all the little extra’s included. &lt;br /&gt;This is a great chance to build everyone’s portfolio&lt;br /&gt;in a professional environment.
