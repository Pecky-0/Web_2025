It is a time to try new things and a time of rebellion. That sounds like it is right up our Fabulous Foodies collective alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amish and Mennonite cultures relate back to German heritage, but like other faith-based cultures i.e. &lt;span&gt;Ashkenazi&lt;/span&gt; Jews and Yiddish, they developed their own versions of both the language and the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has ever accused these folk of healthy eating, but their food is designed to sustain them through the hard labor of a pre-industrial agricultural lifestyle. You do heavy manual labor dawn til dusk and you can pack away a heaping helping of mashed potatoes and gravy without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an image search for "Amish Mitt Romney" and came up with the elephant picture. Ouch! Gators got yer nose!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a pretty interesting band called Rumspringa. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieMOIn06yzo&amp;amp;feature=list_related&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;list=AV4oVf-d_DwKDfk2OyyKDEyNMf8cZeIl6k"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieMOIn06yzo&amp;amp;feature=list_related&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;list=AV4oVf-d_DwKDfk2OyyKDEyNMf8cZeIl6k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the Mormon style of "Rumspringa" is their time as Elders and Sisters doing missionary work. This video shows them coming home to their families and seems to me to depict Mormon style...&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQcSGVmXKNQ&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQcSGVmXKNQ&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most &lt;em&gt;words of wisdom&lt;/em&gt;, the Mormons' started with the complaint of a woman. This led to restrictions of habit and diet assuring health for the faithful. Oddly, most of the restrictions we think of today are relatively modern interpretations of the Prophet's words, becoming more prominent as the focus on multiple wives diminished. Joesph Smith actually proposed a restriction on the eating of meat stating that animals had souls. Most of today's Mormons are happy carnivores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitely not okay: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alcohol, including wine and beer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black tea, green tea,and other caffeinated teas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee and recipes that use it (which may even include desserts like tiramisu)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iced coffee and iced caffeinated tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illegal drugs, recreational drugs, and illicit prescription medications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tobacco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else seems to be up for debate. The good news is Mormon-style includes a high level of tolerance. If you don't keep Mormon "kosher" you may not be invited to Temple but you still are part of the family. And it is all about family!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month we did what every family knows should never be done and we opened up the topic of religion. My request to all of our members is to keep any comments polite, respectful and light-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember there are no rules. T&lt;span&gt;he Wednesday before the dinner,&lt;/span&gt; Caryl will email the address to those attending. Be sure to RSVP early as we always fill up quickly. Do RSVP though, especially if it gets you on the waiting list. Usually the waiting list people get to join us for dinner. Plan to cook on site, unless your recipe takes 45 minutes or more to prepare start to finish. Because the oven opens and closes often baked goods (excepting cookies) are best done ahead of time. Remember this isn’t just a potluck; this is about sharing the pleasure of cooking and food, and learning from one another while drinking wine 'n stuff and having great conversations. Bring what you'd like to drink plus a little to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337022035000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331387248000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rumspringa, Mormon-style</name><id>qxhmlcyqgbrb</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336777200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/55774092/</event_url></item>
