NASHUA RIVER RAIL TRAIL&lt;br /&gt;Because of the recent rain, the Rockingham trail will have puddles and muddy areas.  I thought it better to move our bike ride to the Nashua River Rail Trail.  My apologies if this is a disappointing change for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Host: Claire P. cell @ 603-247-0897 &lt;br /&gt;RAIN SNOW CANCELS THIS EVENT!&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go for a bike ride on the Nashua River Rail Trail. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.  This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.   I thought that we would bike for about two or three hours, and if people are in the mood, we could plan on going out for some foods and chatting nearby afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 12:00 pm at the Depot Rd, Hollis NH  location.  Please follow these directions.  Take route 111 West into Hollis.  Once in Hollis, take route 111 East.  The trail is about Â¼ mile up the road.  Look for the Amerigas propane tank, the trail is right next to it.  &lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring your sunscreen, insect repellent and plenty of fluids.&lt;br /&gt;This event is at no cost! I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287260283000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286746161000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy Biking in the Nashua/Ayer/Pepperell trail</name><id>15065137</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287244800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/15065137/</event_url></item>
