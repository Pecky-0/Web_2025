I will teach you how to build one by using common hand tools. The Solar Furnace heater will be made of aluminum cans. I'm estimating the whole process will take about two to three hours to build. If it is raining out I will reschedule the workshop! We will be joined by other meetup groups, so prepare to meet others who share a passion for saving money and being more sustainable! We will be having a potluck lunch so bring something to share. My home is still so new that the address may not be in &amp;quot;mapquest&amp;quot; or on a &amp;quot;GPS&amp;quot; system so you can use my neighbors house as an waypoint, use: &amp;quot;12 Hampshire Ave&amp;quot;in Durham. I am right next to this address, I'm on the dirt road. Look for the blue mailbox. I will give a tour of my home and explain the basics of building your own home. We are asking for a donation of $5 for this event. If anyone has any questions don't hesitate to contact me at: 603-312-6735 I will be having a workshop every month at my place. See you there.
