&lt;p&gt;We did this a few times last year and we did such a great job...yup they contacted us again to help out!&amp;nbsp; This is their &amp;ldquo;Fill a cruiser&amp;rdquo; event that will be happening at Stop &amp;amp; Shop in Amesbury, we will be unloading the trucks when they come back from the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They need a group of up to 15 people. They will accept kids that are 11 or 12 and up, as long as mom or dad is there to supervise. The stairs into the cellar are a little dicey, so they don&amp;rsquo;t like taking kids much younger than that. If the day is miserable, they sort the food in the cellar &amp;ndash; a little more cramped but it&amp;rsquo;s doable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you dress appropriately as you never know what the weather will be like, we won't know until we get there if we will be working in doors or out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are running late, can&amp;rsquo;t find us or need to cancel at the last minute, the meetup phone number is: 978-304-2811.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please remember that if you have not paid your dues for this year, be prepared to pay them at this event. If you need to find out if you owe money, please look at your profile page where it states &amp;ldquo;Membership dues last recorded by your Organizer".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come back to the site and change your RSVP, if your plans change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank You, &lt;br /&gt;
