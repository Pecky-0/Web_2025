A 3 mile loop along the Charles River, starting at the American Legion Marsh Post 442 in Cambridge.  Complete with Coffee, donuts and healthier snacks before and a free lunch and reception after the walk,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Registration starts at 10AM.  The walk starts at 11AM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dog friendly event.  Dave is the founder and chair of the walk and he brings his dog every year.  Dog hikers are welcome to start a team, come on their own or join his team.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each walker's 15 dollar registration gets you the T-shirt, refreshments and lunch.  Looking for more: The Legion post has a bar with inexpensive drinks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cause: Dave started this event because of what the Phoenix Society meant to him after he was burned and what he has seen it do for others with massive disabling burns.   The Phoenix Society is very efficient organization.  Most of their work is performed by volunteers, most of them burn survivors, and they tend to work by forming partnerships where they can so as to avoid creating extra expenses.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to know more, Please ask Dave.  He will be glad to tell you what they did for him, give you a link to some of his story, or describe the work he has seen them do for others.
