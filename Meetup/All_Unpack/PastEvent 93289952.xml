Hannah is a Red; her crime is murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeking a path to safety in an alien and hostile world, Hannah unknowingly embarks on a path of self-discovery that forces her to question the values she once held true and the righteousness of a country that politicizes faith."&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julia</member_name><member_id>10775021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357615757000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>thatotherbookgroup</urlname><id>1149392</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>That Other Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1354162075000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>When She Woke</name><id>93289952</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357603200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/thatotherbookgroup/events/93289952/</event_url></item>
