I've seen Active Child before and they put on a good live show, good songs to try out include "Hanging On," "Playing House," and "Wilderness." I don't know Balam Acab as well, but "Regret Making Mistakes" stands out. &lt;br /&gt;

 Anyways, let's meet at Big City before the show at 7:30 (138 Brighton Ave, the next block over from the venue), and we can head over before the opener goes on stage at 9. &lt;br /&gt;
