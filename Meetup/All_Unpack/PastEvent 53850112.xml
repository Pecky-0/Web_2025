 &lt;br /&gt;

 Its easy enough for me to hang around after work and go to The Coat, but I know there are liberty folk southwest of Portsmouth who may otherwise be inclined to attend if a MeetUp were held closer to home. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If successful, seacoast residents interested in attending a SeaL MeetUp would be no more than a 20 minute drive to either of the host towns (Dover, Portsmouth or Exeter?) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We'll be meeting at the bar at restaurant 11 Water Street. The bar *does* serve food, you can check out the lunch (bar) menu here (&lt;a href="http://11waterstreet.com/lunch.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://11waterstreet....&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Depending on turnout/demand, I would hope that this may turn into an ongoing event. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332214417000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330236224000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The First Exeter Liberty MeetUp!</name><id>53850112</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1331854200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/53850112/</event_url></item>
