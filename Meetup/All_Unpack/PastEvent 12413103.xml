Screenplay: Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch based on the play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. Musical Score: Max Steiner. Cast: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid. Dooley Wilson was right - the fundamental things do still apply: an excellent story, inspired acting, wickedly smart dialogue, and a timeless moral quandary that engages our minds as well as our hearts. In an occupied North African city during World War II, an apolitical American (Humphrey Bogart) runs Rick's Cafe. Although he is unfazed by his questionable customers (partisans, Nazis, emigres, swindlers and more), Rick's cool is shaken when the woman who left him in Paris (a luminous Ingrid Bergman) walks in to his cafe. Before Casablanca, Bogart was cast as mostly criminals and cads, and his very modern ambivalence towards playing the hero keeps this classic on everyone's top ten lists.
