I do have games, but bring others if you want, and be prepared for some ping pong as well! Anyone wanting to play chess for a change, I have several chess games too. As usual, bring snacks and byob. Hope to see you all here! Note: GPS may take you through back roads, but if you're coming down route 84, take the route 74 exit and your gps won"t take you down any dirt roads... :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see the mailbox on moon road, turn on to the street right there, and it's the first house on the right... big cedar home...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, we may have an outdoor fire pit going too!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marion buteau</member_name><member_id>12445225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369361416000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1369226469000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Maragaritaville at Marion's instead!!!</name><id>120643652</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369350000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/120643652/</event_url></item>
