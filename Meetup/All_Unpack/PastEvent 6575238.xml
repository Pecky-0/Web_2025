If you'd like to show up and see if slots open, or if we get enough folks to run a second group in a particular time slot, I can't promise prizes, but we'll do what we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Post: Hi, everyone. We had such a good time running this last year that we're going full tilt into it again. So join Andy, Matt, Chris, James, and possibly other DMs for a day of D&amp;amp;D adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setting: Icewind Dale in the Forgotten Realms. Five adventurers set off on a quest. For their pains, their players will earn special RPGA Campaign Cards, and possibly other prizes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We intend to have slots running at Noon, 2 PM, 4 PM, and 6 PM. Because there's only limited numbers of DMs and playing space, please sign-up for the event by emailing Andy at paulie_mayhew [AT] hotmail [DOT] com  We'll do our best to accommodate all walk-ins as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Andy&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194278584000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192740509000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worldwide D&amp;D Game Day @ Pandemonium Books &amp; Games</name><id>6575238</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194105600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/6575238/</event_url></item>
