&lt;p&gt;Please consider joining us every 2nd Saturday of the month to watch a movie in Spanish. You will be provided with verbs and quotes from the movie feature, Pop Corn &amp;amp; Drinks. The movie we'll be watching is: Under the Same Moon: The debut feature from director Patricia Riggen, this drama centers on a young boy's journey across the U.S./Mexico border to be reunited with his mother. Adrian Alonso stars as Carlitos, a Mexican adolescent living with his grandmother while his mother works as a maid in the U.S., hoping someday to send for her child. But when the grandmother dies unexpectedly, Carlitos must sneak across the border and seek out his mother. Featuring a supporting performance by America Ferrera of ABC's Ugly Betty, Under the Same Moon premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us to watch this love story. At the end of the movie you will be given a CD with Spanish music, with current and classics for your enjoyment and practice!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You can text me or call me at (617) 412-8965 if you get lost or need Directions!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Johanny</member_name><member_id>45519302</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358112859000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-955</urlname><id>1226919</id><group_lat>42.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>South Shore Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356501301000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pelicula "La Misma Luna"</name><id>96525182</id><headcount>8</headcount><duration>9000000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358017200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-955/events/96525182/</event_url></item>
