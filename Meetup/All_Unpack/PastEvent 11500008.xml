I will be at the theater by 6PM and the group should head into the theater by 6:30...or as soon as they let people go in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok.    I'm sorry but I just have to do this.   I am going to see this movie in any case, so I thought I would schedule a meetup for any others who might have loved these books.  This is based on the second book of the series, which was my favorite.  Also this one centers around love lovely Jacob, who I thought did the best acting job on the first film.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a Boston Movie Badge.   If the movie is upstairs I will try to snag a table by the big windows at the top of the escalator.  If it is downstairs I will be by the ropes.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group beforehand, you can catch us afterward.  We congregate outside the room where the movie has just played to discuss the movie a bit and also discuss where to go after for drinks and munchies, for anyone interested in post movie festivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twilight Saga:  New Moon&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: November 20, 2009 &lt;br /&gt;Director: Chris Weitz &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Ashley Greene, Rachelle Lefevre, Billy Burke, Peter Facinelli, Nikki Reed, Kellan Lutz, Jackson Rathbone, Michael Sheen, Dakota Fanning &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Romance, Thriller &lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newmoonthemovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newmoonthe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: In the second installment of Stephenie Meyer's phenomenally successful &amp;quot;Twilight&amp;quot; series, the romance between mortal and vampire soars to a new level as Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) delves deeper into the mysteries of the supernatural world she yearns to become part ofâ€”only to find herself in greater peril than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following Bella's ill-fated 18th birthday party, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and his family abandon the town of Forks, Washington, in an effort to protect her from the dangers inherent in their world. As the heartbroken Bella sleepwalks through her senior year of high school, numb and alone, she discovers Edward's image comes to her whenever she puts herself in jeopardy. Her desire to be with him at any cost leads her to take greater and greater risks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of her childhood friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), Bella refurbishes an old motorbike to carry her on her adventures. Bella's frozen heart is gradually thawed by her budding relationship with Jacob, a member of the mysterious Quileute tribe, who has a supernatural secret of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a chance encounter brings Bella face to face with a former nemesis, only the intervention of a pack of supernaturally large wolves saves her from a grisly fate, and the encounter makes it frighteningly clear that Bella is still in grave danger. In a race against the clock, Bella learns the secret of the Quileutes and Edward's true motivation for leaving her. She also faces the prospect of a potentially deadly reunion with her beloved that is a far cry from the one she'd hoped for. With more of the passion, action and suspense that made &amp;quot;Twilight&amp;quot; a worldwide phenomenon, &amp;quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&amp;quot; is a spellbinding follow-up to the box office hit.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264954036000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254250484000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Twilight Saga: New Moon</name><id>11500008</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258844400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/11500008/</event_url></item>
