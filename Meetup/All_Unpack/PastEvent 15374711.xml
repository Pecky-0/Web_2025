He was MUCH MORE that a singular spiritual being as is currently believed.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was called &amp;quot;Jeshua 12&amp;quot; and his mission included preparing humanity to spiritually survive changes to come in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since all other records have since been twisted and perverted, we can now understand why the original records were hidden and cloistered so they could be brought back now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this Meetup, a recording will be played telling the soulful story of Jeshua's arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These records were preserved by the Melchizedek Cloister Emerald Order (MCEO), described on this link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.azuritepress.com/melchizedek_cloister.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.azuritepre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, the group who preserved these records also preserved WAY more information, which is vital for us to know at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is directly related to what is going to happen here in 2012 and how to energetically prepare NOW! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go up first driveway with Meetup sign at the end, and in the f ront door with another Meetup sign.
