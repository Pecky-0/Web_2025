&lt;p&gt;It has definitely been a while since we have played, but we are going to re-institute our regular nights for playing Cashflow!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 1st meeting will be &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 26 at 7 PM, at the Marino Recreation Center at Northeastern University's campus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have never been there, there are ample vending machines and a couple restaurants there for dinner in case you haven't had it.  But we do ask that you arrive and have dinner early, so that it doesn't interfere with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never played before, then this is a great night to start! We will explain the rules, and then get started playing the game right away at 7 PM. &lt;strong&gt;So don't be late,&lt;/strong&gt; Or you will likely be paired up with someone instead of being on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking:&lt;/strong&gt; The only parking is metered parking, along with spots for Fenway residents. So keep that in mind, however it is immediately off the green E line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/strong&gt; Do You have a better location where we can play? Please send me an e-mail or write on the message board any locations where you think we could play without any inconvenience. We have always enjoyed the Marino recreation center, but it has not always been convenient for everyone. So as we are getting started with a new year, we want to have locations that are feasible for all! Your help is greatly appreciated :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See you on Tuesday, February 26!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send me a text at 781-333-8815 when you get there if you cannot find us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Purple Bag and the Cashflow Board Game</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361973130000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360263622000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>LET'S PLAY CASHFLOW!!!</name><id>103530132</id><duration>7200000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361923200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/103530132/</event_url></item>
