I am now making this official by inviting all those who couldn't make it for Friday to join us the next day.  Those of you who left on Friday can come back for more on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring games, breakfast/lunch (depending on when you come), or just bring yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me a call if you what to know if we're still going: Ben 617-997-3545.  I plan to game all day.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Warmus</member_name><member_id>5401423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260532623000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254175481000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Infamous Day After at Ben's</name><id>11491557</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259416800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/11491557/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
