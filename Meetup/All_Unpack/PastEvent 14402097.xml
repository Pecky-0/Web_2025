<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Sorry for the short notice, but a few of us are heading to Vermont to see what we have been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of our Vermont rides have only scratched the bottom of this great state, last week Jim &amp;amp; I explored a small section from White Water Junction south on 106, but not before we had to hit the slab and get back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to beat the traffic and get a good head start on the day we will need to leave early as we will have nearly 4 hours before we can get off the highway and enjoy the scenery. So you know that we do stop, the 4 hours includes a couple stops for gas and coffee on the way, and there will be plenty of stops for photos etc. throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Hess station in Auburndale at 6AM and ride to meet Jim at 7AM at Dunkin Donuts in Chelmsford on Drum Hill Road, just off Rt 3 at exit 32 &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=Dunkin'+Donuts&amp;amp;sll=42.623215,-71.363744&amp;amp;sspn=0.002424,0.004699&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;split=1&amp;amp;rq=1&amp;amp;ev=zi&amp;amp;radius=0.14&amp;amp;hq=Dunkin'+Donuts&amp;amp;hnear=&amp;amp;ll=42.623476,-71.363717&amp;amp;spn=0.002424,0.004699&amp;amp;z=18" target="_blank"&gt;MAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be taking Rt 3 north to Rt 89 to Waterbury VT (170 Miles) When we get off we will have roughly 9 hours to get home by sunset, via a combo of highway and backroads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather is expected to be perfect in the 70's all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281757353000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281628669000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vermont Adventure II</name><id>14402097</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281693600000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/14402097/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/d/global_13850893.jpeg</photo_url></item>
