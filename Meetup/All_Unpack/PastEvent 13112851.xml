I will see everyone at the Club House at noon time.  It is going to be a terrific day, about 60 or so, according to the weather on Channel 5 this morning.  I look forward to seeing everyone there and for those who did not RSVP, come on down!!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.  My cell number is 617-640-9634.  I will be at the gym Sunday morning for a spin class but feel free to call me anytime after 7:00 am.
