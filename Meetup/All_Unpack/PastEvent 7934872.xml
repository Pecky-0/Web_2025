<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 2-day 16 mile hike on the Appalachian Trail starting 2 miles west of West Cornwall, CT on West Cornwall Rd. We will head southbound on the ridgeline along the eastern edge of Sharon Mountain in the Housatonic State Forest. Then Up Silver Hill to have a rest at the Silver Hill campsite and then down along the Housatonic River (30%). In the portion along the Housatonic River at about 9 miles we will reach the lean-to for the night. The next day we complete our final 7 miles of the hike along the Housatonic and then head up the lovely St. Johns Ledges, hit Calebs Peak, onto Fuller Mountain, and finally down to Rte 341 in Kent. There are 8 lookouts noted in varying directions and we hope they will be of good quality. Not a real lot of altitude gain (580 ft in beginning and 700 ft towards the end, with about 1,270 ft max. altitude) but a fair amount of up/down (+/- 400 ft.) for this section in the first 6.5 miles and last 4.75 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***5/16/08 Note: Shower forcast improved - day 1 40% after 4 PM, 10% before; day 2 30%***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet 5/17/08 at 10 AM on the shoulder of West Cornwall Rd. 2 miles west of West Cornwall, CT. We'll hike with rest stops the 9 miles to the lean-to for the night. I figure we'll reach the lean-to at about 7 PM at the latest (more likely 6 PM). We'll have dinner and set up for the night by sundown at about 8 PM. We'll get up and ready at a leasurly pace the second day. We should be hiking by 8 AM and reach the endpoint by about 3 PM, 5/18/08. We would then shuttle back to the beginning to pick up vehicles. We then could hit a local establishment for dinner before heading home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that terrain, conditions, &amp;amp; individual party members may affect the overall timing of the hike &amp;amp; may necessitate backup plans if any member of the party runs into significant issues or if there are weather related issues that spring up. I have been conservitive with the estimated times and as long as all parties are reasonable fit, experienced, and equiped we could come in earlier than I estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;== ADVISED MUST-BRING GEAR/SUPPLIES ==&lt;br /&gt;* Backpack -suitable to hold sleeping bag and all other gear and food, overall weight should be no more than 30 - 35 lbs&lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots -Must be comfortable &amp;amp; broken in &lt;br /&gt;* 2 pair wool socks&lt;br /&gt;* Hat -something good in the rain and/or sun&lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing -Cold mornings &amp;amp; possibly hot afternoons, avoid cotton as it stays wet.&lt;br /&gt;* Comfortable underwear -no chaffing!&lt;br /&gt;* Rain poncho/jacket -essential! -rain pants optional&lt;br /&gt;* 3 season sleeping bag -packed&lt;br /&gt;* Bug spay -must have&lt;br /&gt;* Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;* Headlamp -or flashlight, fresh batteries&lt;br /&gt;* 2 quart water min. -strongly suggest bringing a water filter to restock on water&lt;br /&gt;* Trail meals -2 lunches, 1 dinner, 1 breakfast.

Look for 6'2" guy &amp; you have my picture on the site.

If more than 7 people go, we will need an additional vehicle to park at the ending point to shuttle people back to the start. If needed, we'll make arrangements.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211334972000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>This couple of segments of the AT aren't too difficult &amp; a great opportunity to get a taste of AT hiking with an overnight at a lean-to.
