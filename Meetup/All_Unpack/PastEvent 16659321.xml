Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.livingforgottenrealms.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.livingforgottenrealms.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.livingforgottenrealms.com&lt;/a&gt; We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CORM1-5 In the Bleak Midwinter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something rotten in the city of Suzail. While a midwinter  festival brings throngs of competitors, merchants, and spectators, it  also brings an element of danger. When the host turns to heroes for  help, they must uncover what lurks under the city's snow and ice. A &lt;em&gt;Living Forgotten Realms&lt;/em&gt; adventure set in Cormyr for characters levels 1-4. This adventure features NPC's from CORM1-1 The Black Knight of Arabel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adventure is being run as a pilot for the Introduction to DM'ing D&amp;amp;D that I'm putting together for those individuals who would like to progress from player to DM to see what it's like to play from the other side of the table.&amp;nbsp; I encourage those of you who can come to do so though we'll only be running one table as I'll be acting as a Co-DM for David as he runs the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*********************************************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.  Please have a character pre-made as pre-generated characters will not be available.  Due to issues arising from previous sessions, if you do not come with a pre-made character you will be seated last at a table, as it's unfair to others who RSVP and are ready on time to have to wait and potentially have the adventure not finish in time before the store closes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298506987000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>David needs some DM training, and we're going to give it to him</why><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1298389581000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms:  In the Bleak Midwinter</name><id>16659321</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298502000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/16659321/</event_url></item>
