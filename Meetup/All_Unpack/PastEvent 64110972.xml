I'm intrigued, and hope others feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Headhunters&lt;/em&gt; is an intense action thriller, as well as a provocative investigation into questions of betrayal, revenge and deadly ambition. The talented Aksel Hennie &lt;em&gt;(Max Manus)&lt;/em&gt; stars as Roger, a charming scoundrel and Norway's most accomplished corporate headhunter. Roger is living a life of luxury well beyond his means, and has begun stealing art to subsidize his expensive lifestyle. At a gallery opening, his wife introduces him to Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, "Game of Thrones"). Not only is he a perfect candidate for the CEO position Roger is currently recruiting for, he is also in possession of a very valuable painting. Roger sees his chance to become financially independent, and starts planning his biggest hit ever, risking it all to get his hands on the painting. When Roger breaks into Greve's house, he finds something that changes his life completely, and soon forces him to run for his life. The headhunt has begun! Based on the bestselling book by author Jo Nesbø.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Headhunters is slick and spritely, a mixture of corporate skullduggery and low-life slapstick that plays like The Firm meets Blood Simple." Liam Lacey, &lt;em&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The sex, nudity and violence are nonstop, but that’s what makes “Headhunters” exciting entertainment. See it before the Hollywood remake, possibly starring Mark Wahlberg, gets it all wrong." V.A. Musetto, &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;93% Certified Fresh, Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the film, we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
