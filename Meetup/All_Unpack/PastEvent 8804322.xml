Learn about our goals and objectives and share your ideas for future meetup events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please submit payment through Paypal when you sign up. To reduce no-shows, the $5 fee will not be refunded unless not enough members sign up for the event and I have to cancel. Please be sure you can attend before you sign up. The entire $5 will go toward the meetup administration fee I paid to organize the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVPs will be closed on October 9th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All members are welcome, new and old. I look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the digital arts group / I'll bring a sign for the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227052895000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222041044000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Networking Dinner @ the Trident</name><id>8804322</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223940600000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/8804322/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
