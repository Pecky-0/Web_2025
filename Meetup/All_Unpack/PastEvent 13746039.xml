You can call Carole Dempsey at the group sales department, tell her you're with meetup, and pay for the tickets of your choice by debit/credit card.  &lt;br /&gt;These can be picked up at the will-call window in the lobby before the curtain goes up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact Carole @ 781-279-7885 &lt;b&gt;by Friday 6/11/10&lt;/b&gt;  to purchase tickets &lt;br /&gt;for any of the following performances:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Thursday, 6/10 at 7:30pm&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Friday, 6/11/10 at 8:00pm&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Saturday 6/12/10 at 4:00pm&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Saturday 6/12/10 at 8:00pm&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Sunday 6/13/10 at 2:00pm&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stonehamtheatre.org/gaslight.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stonehamth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I myself am not sure yet if I will be going, but please post the day/time of tix. you choose, and I may see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Should you desire to have a meal, snack, dessert,  or beverage before or after the play, I suggest the following locales:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 99 Restaurant in Stoneham is on Rt 28 (Main St) which theatre is located on.  Located directly off Rt. 95.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In April, some of us dined at nearby Polcari's Restaurant in Woburn, on Montvale Ave, directly off Rt. 93.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been told that the &amp;quot;Felicia's&amp;quot; restaurant in Stoneham is very very good, though you may need reservations on a weekend.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:  The Stoneham Theatre's next production in &amp;quot;Always Patsy Cline&amp;quot; in the month of July.  We will have access to discounted tix for this highly acclaimed production, and a meetup will be scheduled soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jill</member_name><member_id>3473807</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276305378000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
