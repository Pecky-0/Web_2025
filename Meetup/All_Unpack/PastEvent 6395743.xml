So if you have anything to donate or if you want to set up a table and just sell stuff for yourself and make a donation to the fund... that would be great too.... We can have the pugs run around the back and people can hang out, visit, watch the pugs etc..... I would love some help at the sale.... so we can take turns... being out front.. etc...  We will rain date it to Sunday if need be.  The Patriots are not playing til.. Monday night.. so it is perfect timing...lol... &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>patty</member_name><member_id>57327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191330401000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190299902000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pug Fun and Garage Sale-- Fund Raiser</name><id>6395743</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191157200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/6395743/</event_url></item>
