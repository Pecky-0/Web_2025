<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Thank you for nominating Kelly and I as the new organizers of the Worcester area pug Meetup. We will do everything we can to continue the wonderful, friendly feel of this smaller group meetup and welcome all suggestions. It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun.  We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and place in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. Note: &lt;b&gt;this is a PUG meetup&lt;/b&gt;...as not all breeds play well together.  There are other small breed Meetups, but this is for PUGS ONLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this has not been strictly enforced at the meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will ask for a $5 fee per family for each Meetup&lt;/b&gt; to cover costs and any leftover money will be donated to the Pug Rescue of New England who do wonderful things. These donations go toward paying the monthly dues to keep this website going so we can all see when the next meetup is taking place.  We will also do special events from time to time to keep it fun and interesting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will introduce ourselves...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217265123000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214676711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Area Pug July Meetup</name><id>8234856</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217091600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/8234856/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/6/0/global_4708448.jpeg</photo_url></item>
