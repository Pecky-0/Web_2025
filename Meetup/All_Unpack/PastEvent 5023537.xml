The group will hike a route of around 6 miles. Bring **water is a must**, a lunch, **bug spray is a must**, and a bathing suit if you want to swim in the lake. Come support this event and have loads of hiking and fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow Hollow State Park and the adjoining Nipmuck State Forest offer over 9,000 acres of recreation opportunities including miles of hiking trails and an 18-acre pond in Eastern Connecticut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 9 AM at the I-84 exit 68 &amp;quot;park and ride&amp;quot; lot so we can carpool to save gas and to minimize the entrance fee. There is a $7 CT resident/$10 non-resident per car entrance fee to the park. We'll get to the park entrance by 9:30 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO CELL reception at the park! If you'd like to drive directly to the park, let Michelle know and she can say where to go in the park to meet us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, please contact the leader Michelle (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/1656853/)"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT make any payment via Paypal!
