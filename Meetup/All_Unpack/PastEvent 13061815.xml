Join us for revelry and craft beer on May 8, 2010, at 5 p.m. at one of Cambridge's newest additions, Lord Hobo. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We have a reservation.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alicia</member_name><member_id>8353321</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273722630000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>beer buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CraftBeerCrew</urlname><id>1469154</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Craft Beer Crew</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270156755000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lord Hobo's Court</name><id>13061815</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273352400000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CraftBeerCrew/events/13061815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/6/3/global_14068451.jpeg</photo_url></item>
