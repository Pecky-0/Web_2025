Well this year we are introducing a whole new way to pray. Bring your baby/toddler/child for an amazing interactive  children's Rosh Hashana service/program. We will be having a special mommy and me circle time at 10:30 am followed with free play,snacks and games. We will also be having babysitting available for those parents who want to sit and enjoy the beginners service. (RSVP is a must for the babysitting part) The children program is from 10:30-1:00 including lunch! You don't want to miss this great opportunity! And we promise you all children are welcome to make as much noise as they like &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;.......the children are the future!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raizel</member_name><member_id>4697687</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253556321000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Jewish parents or caregivers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mommy-and-me-with-a-jewish-twist-north-shore</urlname><id>1493750</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>mommy and me with a Jewish twist</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248744168000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Mommy and me on Rosh Hashana </name><id>10972983</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253370600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mommy-and-me-with-a-jewish-twist-north-shore/events/10972983/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/8/0/global_9807968.jpeg</photo_url></item>
