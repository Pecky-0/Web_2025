<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be a chance for members to meet, introduce themselves, and talk about how this meet-up group can make the most of our virtual and physical connections. I am open to getting input on how we can make the most of this opportunity to create a community whose focus is cultivating greater awareness among ourselves, and of the inner and outer worlds of our lives. All levels of meditators and mindfulness enthusiasts are welcome. Hope to see you there! There will be some chairs, but bring your own cushion, bench, or other sitting device if you'd like. There will be a recommended contribution of five dollars to help cover expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We are just off Willard St and Willard Haven, fourth house on the left.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223337929000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219846095000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mindfulness meetup group introduction</name><id>8631219</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221087600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/8631219/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
