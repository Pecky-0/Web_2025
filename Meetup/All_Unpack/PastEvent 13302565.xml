The migrating dolphins are herded into a hidden cove where they are netted and killed by means of spears and knives over the side of small fishing boats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie follows former dolphin trainer Ric O’Barry's quest to document the dolphin hunting operations in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. In the 1960s, O'Barry captured and trained the five wild dolphins who would play the role of &amp;quot;Flipper&amp;quot; in the hit television series of the same name. This pop-culture phenomenon fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins. It was when one of the dolphins committed a form of suicide in his arms, closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, that O'Barry came to see it as a curse not a blessing. Days later, he found himself being arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin.  Since then O'Barry has worked tirelessly as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Mangus</member_name><member_id>8074795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276383736000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272339593000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck and DVD: The Cove</name><id>13302565</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276369200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/13302565/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_7118529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
