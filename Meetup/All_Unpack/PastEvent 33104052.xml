Let's give him a Ron Paul-style welcome! Since the mainstream media has labeled Gov. Perry a favorite, there my be some media coverage of this event (even if it's just local news). We plan to show up and wave signs for our favorite candidate. I suggest we bring Ron Paul signs and refrain from making this a protest with anti-Perry signs, etc. but I'll leave that decision to you. Buts a reminder, we should stay polite and professional at all times, regardless of how Perry treated Ron at the Sept 7 debate [see pic!]. Feel free to bring/make your own signs. We'll have signs for you if you don't have any, just be sure to bring your self. The dinner starts at 6 so let's be there at 5 to meet Perry and his cronies. You're welcome to stick around until the dinner guests are exiting but it'll likely be too dark by then. Most of us will stay til 6 or 6:15.
