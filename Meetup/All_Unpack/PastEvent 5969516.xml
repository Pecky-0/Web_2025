Stop at Barts for lunch Pot Luck, buy or whatever..I DONT worry about those things..might carry the grill and food in the boat..dont care either...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Start from the BARTS put in on Pleasant st and rte 159..&lt;br /&gt;continuing down to the boat launch. 3.6 mile trip&lt;br /&gt;this is sort of short and not much interesting stuff to see like the long trip...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Just go to the Rainbow Dam upstrem portion of the river which is very calm and easy to turnaround if the weather takes a turn towards rain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on wether the dam is releasing water, the river street part of the river is usually low and not well passible, WITH the release on..there is some whitewater..NOt the greatest for FIBERGLASS kayaks for that start location. but the last 2 times it might be ok for the shorter ones..&lt;br /&gt;From 200 yards on down..fiberglass is fine..its flatwater....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;MEET AT THE RIVER STREET LOCATION FIRST&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;  to assess the situation, drive to BARTS or to Rainbow as we choose..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can have lunch at BARTS lawn in the back..then its just 3 or so miles to the finish...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting there:&lt;br /&gt;From Hartford or from the north, &lt;br /&gt;take 91 to exit #38  this is rte 75, go north...(towards poquanock and bradley apt.)&lt;br /&gt;from the exit off of 91..... River Street is about 2 miles on the right, you will cross the river by bridge, then take the right on to River st..go less than a quarter mile and on the right is sign with Strawberry Park or something like that on it ....look for a driveway/parking lot, i usually drive down the grass to the put in area. If you dont see cars in the lot but see someone by the kayaks a bit further down on the river bank, you got there a bit late and we started to bring the cars to the Windsor boat launch...&lt;br /&gt;I have the Blue Toyota Avalon with a few yaks on a trailer..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Mapquest or GPS directions , use 76 River street, Windsor, ct &lt;br /&gt;that will get you close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The windsor boat launch: off of rte 159 = Windsor Ave, heading south from 291...2 nd left , look for boat launch sign onto East Barber street, cross rail tracks to end...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From River street you can go by 91 s to exit 35 rte 218 =putnam highway...left  to Windsor ave rte 159, right on windsor ave to the left onto East Barber atreet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or just take 75s to 159s..a bit slower...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain cancells this event, so i will be checking prior to heading out.&lt;br /&gt;Light spotty rain back up plan... meet at River street lot anyway unless i see a storm comming and cancel the event..then We can go to BARTS for lunch or somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184089217000</updated><rating><average>4.26999998093</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183479264000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Kayak trip down the Farmington River and Pot Luck or pizza etc at BARTS..</name><id>5969516</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183915800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5969516/</event_url></item>
