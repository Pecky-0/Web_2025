A party with live music, bon fire food and camping.  Please bring any climbing gear you have,  a tent if you wish to spend the night, anything special for the grill, a dish to share and BYOB.  I'm thinking if we get climbing around 11am we can be back to the yard in time for the band to start around 4pm or so.  Anyone not being able to come to Stonehouse but would like to attend the party please come around 4pm. The climbing gym will be open then too.  This will be rain or shine, we will just climb in the gym and not do Stonehouse if it rains.  &lt;br /&gt;This is an all ages/level climbers event!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the meetup sign out front</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kellie Barr-Foster</member_name><member_id>6992283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286032455000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281110736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Labor Day Weekend climb and party</name><id>14340393</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283698800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/14340393/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/6/global_13152102.jpeg</photo_url></item>
