There is a reason for that. I was busy starting a small company, teaching at a Connecticut university and raising my two children. I also spent a decade serving in the U.S. Department of State in Washington, DC and overseas. &lt;br /&gt;After joining the State Department I received a Presidential appointment under Ronald Reagan. I worked hard to serve our country and received many leadership awards. If you're curious, check out my bio. I believe all service to this great nation no matter where or what type is important. That's why for many years I was a volunteer firefighter and EMT. Our police, firefighters and, of course, our American soldiers are among the bravest citizens I have met. &lt;br /&gt;More . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know why I am running now? This country needs decent, honest, hard-working people to help steer us back to the right path. The &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; we were promised, isn't the correct change. Government spending is way out of control; our freedoms are being stripped away from us; the federal government is intruding in our lives where it doesn't belong; and now Washington is threatening our children's future by the excessive debt burden this Congress is putting on them and their children. I can't sit back when this Administration drafts reports stating that law-abiding citizens, including our military, are potential terrorists! Washington is arguing that the vast majority of our citizens, who are conservative, are a threat to this great country! It's outrageous that the Administration gets away with labeling law-abiding American citizens &amp;quot;potential terrorists&amp;quot; simply because they choose to exercise their right to free speech and assembly at a Tea Party rally. The voting record for our 2nd District Congressman proves he is part of this problem. Like many other career politicians in Congress, he doesn't read the bills he votes for. And like Senator Dodd, he actively supports legislation taking away the freedoms guaranteed us by our Founding Fathers in the Constitution. It has to stop now before we ruin our free nation. Washington is dragging the middle class down instead of lifting up those who need help. My plan is to help bring sanity back to Washington. We need good candidates to step up and seek public office with the goal of serving the people, not themselves and the special interest groups. It's really quite simple. When I go to Washington you will be my boss. The job you hire me to do is to represent all District 2 voters. If you have a moment, take a look at my platform and you'll see some of the details about how I plan to it.  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262992212000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260526581000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Daria Novak (Congressional Candidate) Coming for Q &amp; A</name><id>12064733</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262818800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/12064733/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/4/global_10345540.jpeg</photo_url></item>
