It's party time! Time for the 4th Anniversary Dream Party! Time to celebrate 4 years of dreaming and dream sharing! Time for dream games, dream songs, dream cards, dream costumes, and dream food! Come meet other members of Boston Dreamers in a fun, informal atmosphere. Come play party games like Dream Charades, Oracle, and the ever popular hilarious Dream Draw Telephone. Or just hang out, nosh, and schmooze. Both introverts and extroverts welcome. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 As always you are invited to dress up in your jammies and bring your teddy bear, or wear a costume of one of your favorite dream characters. Even a mask or a dream hat can be fun to try on. You can change into your costume once you get here if you want. There will be masks and hats on hand if you want to try them on. It's all optional, of course. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 What to bring: The theme of this party is 4, so please bring 4 of something, like: 4 pennies, 4 rocks, 4 friends, 4 dreams, 4 words, 4 photos, etc. Please also bring some vegetarian food to share. You can also bring your own dream paraphernalia if you want, like oracle cards, your dream journal, a magic wand, or a personal power object. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 6 PM - 12 Midnight. This is a party, so you can drop in whenever you feel like it. Anyone wishing to attend the Dream Party must RSVP to be sent the address of the party. Sorry, I can't put the address on the net. Complete address and directions will be sent to you prior to the event after you RSVP. Street parking will be pre-arranged with the city of Cambridge, so you can park near the house.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deerheart</member_name><member_id>7399016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366210832000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dreamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonDreamers</urlname><id>1339734</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Dreamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359933508000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>We Are Four: The 4th Anniversary Dream Party!</name><id>102857842</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365285600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonDreamers/events/102857842/</event_url></item>
