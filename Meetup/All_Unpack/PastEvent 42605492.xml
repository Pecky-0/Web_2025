PIERCE VIA CRAWFORD PATH Distance Time Elev Change Trail / Waypoint Latitude Longitude starting at Crawford Path Trailhead (HiCtr) 44&amp;deg; 13' 11" 71&amp;deg; 24' 36" The main parking area at the south end of this trail is now located on the west side of Mt. Clinton Rd. a short distance north of its junction with US 302. The former parking lot on US 302 has been closed, and Crawford Path hikers are requested to use the Mt. Clinton Rd. lot because the parking spaces at other lots in the area are needed for the trails that originate from them. Due to hazardous conditions (heavy trail and bridge damages) Dry River Trail is closed until further notice. 0.20 mi 10 min +132 ft on Crawford Path 0.20 mi 10 min +132 ft Caution: Parts of this trail are dangerous in bad weather. Several lives have been lost on the Crawford Path because of failure to observe proper precautions. Below Mt. Eisenhower, a number of ledges are exposed to the weather, but they are scattered, and shelter is usually available in nearby scrub. From the Eisenhower- Franklin col, the trail runs completely above treeline, exposed to the full force of all storms. The most dangerous part of the path is the section on the cone of Mt. Washington, beyond Lakes of the Clouds Hut. Always carry a compass and study the map before starting. If trouble arises on or above Mt. Monroe, take refuge at Lakes of the Clouds Hut or go down the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail. The Crawford Path is well marked above treeline with large cairns; in poor visibility, great care should be exercised to stay on it because many of the other paths in the vicinity are much less clearly marked. If the path is lost in bad weather and cannot be found again after diligent effort, one should travel west, descending into the woods and following streams downhill to the roads. On the southeast, toward the Dry River valley, nearly all the slopes are more precipitous, the river crossings are potentially dangerous, and the distance to a highway is much greater. The main parking area at the south end of this trail is now located on the west side of Mt. Clinton Rd. a short distance north of its junction with US 302. to the junction of Crawford Connector 44&amp;deg; 13' 15" 71&amp;deg; 24' 23" 0.20 mi 11 min +169 ft on Crawford Path 0.40 mi 21 min +300 ft The Crawford Path follows the south bank of Gibbs Brook, and a side path leads 40 yd. left to Gibbs Falls. to the junction of Gibbs Falls spur 44&amp;deg; 13' 16" 71&amp;deg; 24' 13" 1.30 mi 1 hr 17 min +1261 ft on Crawford Path 1.70 mi 1 hr 38 min +1562 ft Soon the trail passes an information sign for the Gibbs Brook Scenic Area, then climbs moderately but steadily.
