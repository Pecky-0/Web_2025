Just heard of a GREAT BBQ place in New England and it's right in Worcester!&lt;br /&gt;Decor is with the BBQ theme!  Let's get together for some baby back ribs or any of the combo meals offered.  Ribs - yummy summer food!  BBQ sauce comes in two varieties - Kansas and Carolina style, both very good. How about a pulled pork sandwich or dinner? Sounds incredible!  Nice selection of draft beer so you know this meal is top notch. Please bring cash to make it easier for paying the tab of your portion.  Only read great reviews of the SMOKESTACK, join us!  Reservations are for the first definite YES replies = 20 members. If you cannot make it and have replied with a yes, can you kindly go back &amp;amp; change your reply so others can attend.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for LINDA </how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283729278000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>13</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279466578000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SMOKESTACK............yummy!</name><id>14136495</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281222000000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/14136495/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/9/global_16505337.jpeg</photo_url></item>
