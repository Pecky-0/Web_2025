RSVP early as maximum capacity is lower than usual, due to venue...OUR HOUSE! When you RSVP, Please list PEOPLE ONLY, not pugs so we can get a head count for capacity and food...1-4pm&lt;br /&gt;We had SO much fun last year and promise we will not let you down this year! We will be grilling out hamburgers and hot dogs and will be posting a list of things that you can bring if you'd like...we will need, soda, paper plates and plastic silverware, chips and dip, potato salad, macaroni salad, tossed salad, appetizers, desserts etc...Please put in the comments when you RSVP what you'd like to bring then as it gets closer we will send out a list of things still needed....if you have a specialty dish, we'd LOVE to try it!&lt;br /&gt;We will have a fenced in area for the pugs including fans and a baby pool, but if your pug can not take the heat, please feel free to keep him/her home in the cool AC and come and enjoy yourself with us!&lt;br /&gt;We will have great food, lawn games, music, Birthday gifts for all the pugs and a birthday cake to celebrate a year of birthdays!&lt;br /&gt;Adult beverages are permitted should you decide you'd like to bring something, otherwise soda will be served.&lt;br /&gt;This is our way once per year of thanking everyone for your year-round support of this wonderful Pug Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and I truly enjoy being the Organizers of the Grafton pug Meetup. We hope that we have met each of you individually, and if we have not, please come up and introduce yourself at the next one. We are constantly trying to come up with new treats for our precious pugs, and ideas to keep it informative and interesting. We welcome all suggestions. It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun.  We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and play in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. Note: &lt;b&gt;this is a PUG Meetup&lt;/b&gt;...as not all breeds play well together.  There are other small breed Meetups, but this is for PUGS ONLY!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this has not been strictly enforced at the Meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will ask for a $5 fee per family for each Meetup&lt;/b&gt; to cover Meetup costs and any leftover money will be donated to  Pug Rescues as well as other animal related charity that we all agree on as a group. These donations go toward paying the monthly dues, snacks and to keep this website going so we can all see when the next Meetup is taking place.  We will also do special events from time to time to keep it fun and interesting!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will introduce ourselves...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erin maguire</member_name><member_id>3828727</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth Mott</member_name><member_id>6811754</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>10300396</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280408459000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273061532000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>fdfdnynkbpc</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279990800000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/13391214/</event_url></item>
