How to find me: I"ll be wearing my trademark green hat+Meetup logo+my screename JediFonger in front as usual. According to my fandango ticket, it is upstairs (3rd floor) in auditorium 14. I'll be in front of the coffee house next to the windows, near the metal seat+tables. If I find a seat, I'll be sitting down.

The movie begins @7:15PM. I shall be there @6:45PM and plan to get seats by 7PM. Remember that we will also be outside of the auditorium after the movie finishes if you miss us before the movie.

I recommend you buy the tickets in advanced here:
