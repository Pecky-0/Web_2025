In summer the Reservation is a popular swimming destination. In the spring and fall, many people hike the trails that ring the pond and visit the replica of Thoreau's one-room cabin.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's park our cars at the Lincoln train station near the supermarket and walk to the pond. Bring your swim suit if you want, we will stop at the pond for a short swim before heading back.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aimee</member_name><member_id>5071381</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342965202000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342557763000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk to and around Walden pond including a short swim</name><id>73756732</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342882800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/73756732/</event_url></item>
