<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;DUE TO A CHANGE IN CONDITIONS and WEATHER FORECAST, WE ARE CHANGING THE LOCATION OF THIS MEETUP TO - WE WILL NOW HIKE THE MOATS AND MEET AT THE DIANA's BATH LOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am posting two days of snowshoe hikes.    If you are prepared, you are welcome to come on either or both days.   Some of us plan on staying overnight in New Hampshire Saturday night, depending on interest, we might try to get a cheap bunk or suite type unit with a kitchen that a group of us can share.  Please email me if you are interested.  I will post details for day two (January 16th) which should be suitable for a well equipped person at near beginner levels, separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;The new route for Saturday can be seen here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hikenewengland.com/LegendTime.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hikeneweng...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snowshoes and crampons are an absolute must for this trip.  Adequate clothing, including non cotton layers for head, face and hands is essential.   Following trails in winter can be much more difficult, especially when there is fresh snow.  As losing the trail is possible, it will be essential that we all stay together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: This is challenging hike.  We will be going above treeline, so you must come prepared for bad weather.   Weather in the mountains is unpredictable.  People have died from exposure hiking in the White Mountains in summer, so care and preparation are essential in January.  Snowshoes and crampons are an absolute must for this trip.  Adequate clothing, including non cotton layers for head, face and hands is essential.   Following trails in winter can be much more difficult, especially when there is fresh snow.  As losing the trail is possible, it will be essential that we all stay together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Necessary equipment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;BE PREPARED FOR HARSH WINTER CONDITIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Headlamp (or flashlight) with spare batteries, or a second headlamp/flashlight. &lt;br /&gt;• Clothing:   Layering will be important   wool, synthetic or belnded shirt/pants  - no jeans or cotton. Cotton does not insulate well when wet. Windy ridge conditions can compound this.  Insulating layers will be essential.&lt;br /&gt;• Outerwear:  Waterproof/windproof jacket (with hood or separate waterproof/windproof head covering) and extra insulation.   Layers are essential as the exertion will generate a great deal of heat.  Rain or ski pants will be important.&lt;br /&gt;• Food and Water: High-energy snacks and at least two quarts of water.&lt;br /&gt;• Other Gear: Sunscreen and insect repellent. &lt;br /&gt;• Trail hardy Footwear.&lt;br /&gt;•  Whatever you'd need to survive an unplanned night out in the mountains.&lt;br /&gt;* Anything else your experience, judgment or research tells you that you need.&lt;br /&gt;See the winter hiking gear and preparation discussion on the message board for more informaiton and ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information please look for the list of 10 essentials, other gear and the Hiker Responsibility Code at &lt;a href="http://www.hikesafe.c..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hikesafe.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Car Pooling –   Lets save some gas money and shrink our carbon footprint! If you have a ride to offer or need a ride please post your needs or availability on your RSVP.  Please note your interest in giving or getting a ride and contact hikers directly if their posts or profiles indicate it might be convenient to share rides with them.  It looks like my car is close to full (I will be taking a dog and two other hikers), but could probably squeeze in another and I'll likely have more room for the return trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs:   Well behaved dogs are welcome, I'm bringing mine.  Please mention your dog in your RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;Please allow plenty of time and let me know ASAP if you are running late as cell phone coverage is not reliable.  Having been burned by no shows a few times, I will not keep people waiting unless I am sure you are coming. &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;MY DISCLAIMER: MY ROLE AS ORGANIZER IN THIS HIKE IS SOCIAL. I AM NOT TRAINED TO BE A GUIDE, NOR HAVE I RECEIVED TRAINING OR INSTRUCTION IN HIKING SAFETY. WHILE I TRY TO HEAD OFF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. IF MY DISAPPEARANCE DURING THIS TRIP WOULD CAUSE YOU MORE THAN ANNOYANCE AND INCONVENIENCE, THIS IS NOT THE TRIP FOR YOU. THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS IN HIKING IN THE MOUNTAINS. IF YOU ARE NOT CONFIDENT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS, PLEASE DO NOT SIGN UP (or change your RSVP to no).  I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF MAKING STUPID OR MINDLESS MISTAKES, SO PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND COME PREPARED WITH APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE, EQUIPMENT AND JUDGMENT.   HOPEFULLY WE'LL ALL HAVE SOME FUN AND ENJOY A GREAT HIKE IN GOOD COMPANY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will be there with an eager shaggy black dog.
