<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The rain held off long enough for all of the Pugs and their owners to have a good time at the May Pug meetup!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, we're all going over to Buford's house where there is a very BIG yard, completely fenced, with plenty of shade, and plenty of room for Puggies and People to play!  Buford says to bring him goodies, but his mom says he's on A DIET!  NO GOODIES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby.  Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool.  There will be biscuits for the dogs and coffee, soft drinks, and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you and your Puggie(s) at our next meetup!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1150414628000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1148238302000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug June Meetup</name><id>4945578</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1150048800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/4945578/</event_url></item>
