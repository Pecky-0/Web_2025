We share a potluck lunch, and then have a featured presenter share about his/her work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know what you will bring as your potluck lunch contribution when you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 meeting fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's presentation will be &lt;b&gt;Structural Integration:  An Overview of the 10 Session Series&lt;/b&gt; with Anna Mulholland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structural Integration is the series of treatments designed by Ida Rolf to reorient the body’s fascia in gravity.  The ten session series has been practiced for about 50 years with great success in restoring functionality and improving posture.  Anna will review the basic outline of the ten session “recipe”, discuss the evolution of the Structural Integration community, and talk about postural analysis techniques.  She will recruit a volunteer to work on during her talk to demonstrate the impact of even a small amount of structural integration work.  If you are interested in volunteering, please be prepared to have your posture analyzed by the group, and bring shorts and a sports bra (or go bare chested, if you are a man).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will welcome you at the front door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247243589000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230346165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies June Meetup:  Structural Integration</name><id>9391228</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244820600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/9391228/</event_url></item>
