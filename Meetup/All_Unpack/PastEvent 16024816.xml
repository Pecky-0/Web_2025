<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Ashley and I are going to hike Mt Waumbek via the Starr King trail and then sled down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is less than 8 miles. You will need winter hiking gear, and experience hiking in winter, or at lest a basic class and regular hiking experience. If you do not have a sled I might be able to provide you with one (I have a couple spare). You will need snowshoes, crampons or traction, headlamp and warm weather gear (I'm too lazy to list it all, but if you are coming you should know what you need), there will be fresh snow and it looks like it will be cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't answer the questions you won't be able to participate in the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was informed that Starr King road is very narrow and hard to turn around in, but we can park at the parking lot across the street where Starr King road meets RT2. We will be in a maroon Audi A4 with mass plates. It should be a lot of fun, so come and join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pete</member_name><member_id>4010848</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ashley Carneal</member_name><member_id>7483830</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295296573000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294862266000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NH W48 Mt.
