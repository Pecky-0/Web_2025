<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>What we've got here is a meetup on a weekend for those who may not be free during the week. It's mid afternoon (2pm) that's meant to cover a couple topics (like for the first one...hardware controllers and software!) that can be focused and people interested can come and learn a bit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be more presentation style and only and hour with stay-or-leave free socialize time at the end. (We have the room till 5pm if you *really* don't want to leave.) I'll give an overview of hardware controllers then cover the basic families in a compare/contrast sort of way. We'll cover some common software applications as well. I'll have actual hardware on hand you could touch and get the feel of. If you feel particularly knowledgeable about hardware please feel free to contact me and you can help or run the presentation. (I've got experience, but I don't claim to be the expert.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: I've gotten a couple people who were interested in bringing hardware. Ping me again to make sure the date/time works for you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do need a a couple things for Saturday: a projector (several people offered [Hi Pat!]) and a simple sound system (Steve...you had offered. I hope the date works for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's about it, post to the boards or mailing list with any question you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon! :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm big, bald, bespectacled, bearded and sporting the laptop.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luke Stark</member_name><member_id>3565678</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1252014497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Music Makers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>musical</urlname><id>413373</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Music Makers With Relaxed Expectations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242134845000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend Gear/Software Meetup</name><id>10393261</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244311200000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/musical/events/10393261/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/b/f/global_8044031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
