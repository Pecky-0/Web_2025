&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;A sportswriter and a real estate agent, husband and father &amp;ndash;Frank Bascombe has been many things to many people. His uncertain youth behind him, we follow him through three days during the autumn of 2000, when his trade as a realtor on the Jersey Shore is thriving. But as a presidential election hangs in the balance, and a postnuclear-family Thanksgiving looms before him, Frank discovers that what he terms &amp;ldquo;the Permanent Period&amp;rdquo; is fraught with unforeseen perils. An astonishing meditation on America today and filled with brilliant insights, &lt;strong&gt;The Lay of the Land&lt;/strong&gt; is a magnificent achievement from one of the most celebrated chroniclers of our time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be at the bottom floor with a copy of the book on the table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337782376000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1481208</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334190839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Lay of the Land by Richard Ford</name><id>60211492</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337725800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group/events/60211492/</event_url></item>
