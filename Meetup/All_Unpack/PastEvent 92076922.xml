&lt;p&gt;Members from Tonya's Boston Happy Hour and other groups will be joining us. "Truly Magical" is an apt description for Boston in December. The rush and anticipation of the holidays are combined with warm, festive gatherings of friends old and new. The chilly weather and spirit of the season allure us to don some elegant evening wear and turn out for enticing social gatherings with flair and cheerful anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Uncorked invites you to join us in your holiday cocktail attire as we enjoy the tastes of some exceptional wines and delicious bites -- all among captivating, friendly people -- in a toast to the holiday season at The College Club of Boston. We'll enjoy the classy Grand Room of this historic club located in a beautiful Back Bay brownstone -- overlooking the sparkling white lights of Commonwealth Avenue Mall. This walkaround tasting affair will feature an array of delectable hors d' oeuvres prepared by their Chef to accompany the list of fine wines being assembled for this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
