Polls be d**ned!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We'll be embarking on Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose.  Many thanks to Andrea for this splendid suggestion by one of my favorite authors (Band of Brothers and D-Day are amongst my most cherished reads).  This one embarks to tell the story of Lewis and Clark, filling in all the gaps that all of us non-history majors totally missed out on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For potentially too much info :-), check out the link below:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.craigr.com/books/undaunted.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.craigr.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harvest Co-op has a great discussion setting, centrally localized and easy to get to by T or car or foot.  However, if folks want to use the group as a means to explore new eateries, I'm open for suggestions.  Till then, we'll stick to the couches and the coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Asst.
