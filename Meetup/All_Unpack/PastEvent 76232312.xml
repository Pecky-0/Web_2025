<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Our August 13 meeting is at Carol's house at 7 PM, where we will learn about hydroponics and her Tower Garden. Hydroponics allow gardeners without soil to grow fruits, vegetables and herbs anywhere there is suitable light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The address is 2 Main Avenue, South Hampton, NH 03827 which is at the corner of Clement Lane and Main Avenue (Rte 107A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower GardenÂ® simplifies traditional gardening, using a unique vertical, hydroponic and aeroponic garden system that makes it easy to grow your own fresh fruits and vegetables at home, on your deck, and patio.. This garden system uses less than 10% of the water, as well as land normally required for 20-28 plants. Tower Garden Organic mineral water was also developed by Tim Blank of Future Growing. With this closed system we can grow all vegetables, berries, fruits, and herbs that are not root plants. We can begin gardening with plants from your local garden center (thoroughly washing off the soil) or start your own from seedlings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Boiester</member_name><member_id>8570902</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344910069000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344031562000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn about hydroponics!</name><id>76232312</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344898800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/76232312/</event_url></item>
