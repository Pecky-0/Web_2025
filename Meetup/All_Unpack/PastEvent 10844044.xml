Please indicate in your RSVP if you plan to join us for this.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chad Perrone started his career as the lead singer of the successful Boston based band Averi, until he ventured out on his own to start his own successful career 3 years ago.  I have seen him perform several times before, both with Averi and on his own, and he always impresses me.  His music is passionate, heartfelt, and written from the soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is playing at the Paradise on July 25th, and I thought it would be fun to post it as an event again on the Live Music Group.  Several of us went to see him last year and as always he put on a great show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad's website (and to her some of his music)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chadperronemusic.com/chad1.6.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.chadperron...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A link to download 4 of his new songs for free&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I received this in the e-mail he sent re: his upcoming show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixmediaav.com/music/CP%20-Wake%20INST.zip" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sixmediaav...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* Advance tix are encouraged, as Chad and his band are very popular in Boston *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are the details:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chad Perrone (and Band)&lt;br /&gt;The Paradise Rock Club&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt;July 25th &lt;br /&gt;8pm&lt;br /&gt;18+.&lt;br /&gt;$12 in advance, $15 at the door.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To purchase tickets:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.thedise.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thedise.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tim Blane and Jon Robert open the show.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* This is a joint event with the Social Fun meetup group.
