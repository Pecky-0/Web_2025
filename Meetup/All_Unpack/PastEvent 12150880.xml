I've just taken over from Cheryl Yeager who's done a fantastic job this last year with book selections and as moderator of the discussions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;       In December we were scheduled to read and talk about &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Help&lt;/i&gt; by Kathryn Stockett.  Unfortunately the event was snowed out by the first blizzard of winter.  Since &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Help&lt;/i&gt; was such an important book and great read, I thought we would reschedule the book for our January meeting.  If you haven't read it yet, don't miss it.  It's the moving story of three women whose lives were deeply affected by the bigotry of the early 60's.  Set in the South, it gives us an intimate look at the struggles each of these women face and their incredible courage to risk everything so that the real truth can be told. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        At January's meeting we'll propose books for the following three months.  I'd like to concentrate on popular, best selling fiction that has recently come out in paperback.  Please feel free to email me with suggestions and I'll post them for consideration before the January meeting.  I'm also open to any suggestions or comments you might have for the group as a whole.  I'm hoping we'll all work together to make this book club meeting a day we'll look forward to each month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        Enjoy your reading, write to me with your comments and I look forward to seeing you at Bruegger's, Coolidge Corner, in January.
