<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/4/2/event_120294082.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;Not an action movie this time, but the cast is just too cool to resist this human drama!   I fell in love with Chris Pine playing the young Captain Kirk, and am interested to see him in a different type of role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #2375a4"&gt;Showtime is 7:15.  I will be at the theater by 6:15 and we will head in for seats at 6:45.&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #666666"&gt;The movie is showing upstairs, so I will at the tables at the top of the escalator before the movie to gather ther group members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I like to see these movies during opening weekend, it is usually a good idea to buy your tickets ahead of time....especially if it is a big movie with lots of buzz.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #468357"&gt;Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after and bring cash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Plot Summary:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;From DreamWorks Pictures comes "People Like Us," a drama/comedy about family, inspired by true events, starring Chris Pine ("Star Trek") as Sam, a twenty-something, fast-talking salesman, whose latest deal collapses on the day he learns that his father has suddenly died. Against his wishes, Sam is called home, where he must put his father's estate in order and reconnect with his estranged family. In the course of fulfilling his father's last wishes, Sam uncovers a startling secret that turns his entire world upside down: He has a 30-year-old sister Frankie whom he never knew about (Elizabeth Banks). As their relationship develops, Sam is forced to rethink everything he thought he knew about this family--and re-examine his own life choices in the process.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
