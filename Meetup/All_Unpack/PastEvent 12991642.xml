I had lunch there today and was very impressed. They don't have a website yet but the entree's range from $11 to $25. Here are directions ; It is on route 1, at the first traffic light EAST of WalMart, it is right next to the nonfunctioning FONICELLO'S Garden supply store. It is located in a strip mall called &amp;quot;Village Walk&amp;quot;. I will post what will eventually be their web address and maybe it'll be up and running soon.
