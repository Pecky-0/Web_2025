<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Come on down for another night of ultimate with our new square frisbees.  With spring in the air, there's no more need for lanyards as we'll be playing skins on skins on triangle fields.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at 8PM at the Cambridge Common baseball diamond which is located a couple blocks north of Harvard Square. We generally play from 8-10PM and then turn into pumpkins or go out for food and drinks. Before attending our events, please review our &lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/about/"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recommend you play in a Speedo for visibility's sake and bring a change of clothes. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/tongue.gif' border='0' alt='tongue' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the cows, chickens and sheep as well as frisbees and first aid kits. Consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/IRMLHWE8OGKZ"&gt;Amazon Wishlist&lt;/a&gt; to support our equipment costs. Our group is all about free love and will always be that way but your optional donations are certainly appreciated!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=10+garden+st+cambridge+ma&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=33.626896,81.738281&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.376807,-71.119566&amp;amp;spn=0.007656,0.019956&amp;amp;z=16"&gt;Cambridge Commons Map&lt;/a&gt;. Parking at Cambridge Common's is tricky and we highly recommend you take the &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; to Harvard Square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about our group, don't hesitate to contact either our Organizers or our Team Ambassadors!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Chea</member_name><member_id>4415505</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>4875881</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207267589000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>We've created an awesome community of fun people who go out of their way to ensure that everyone feels welcomed and included.
