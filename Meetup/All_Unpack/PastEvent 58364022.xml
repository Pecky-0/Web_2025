ENNEAGRAM AT THE MOVIES &lt;br /&gt;

Vegetarian dinner provided from 7 to 8pm. Fine to show up anytime. It's helpful for me to know in advance if you are coming, particularly if you are eating, though if fine just to show up if you can't decide beforehand. You are welcome to bring additional items if you want. Movie starts at 8pm and generally ends approximately at 10:30pm. We stop the movie on occasion to talk about Enneagram types, subtypes and relationship dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost is $20-25 sliding scale. Please feel free to bring friends and I can help them learn the types if they don't know the Enneagram. &lt;br /&gt;
