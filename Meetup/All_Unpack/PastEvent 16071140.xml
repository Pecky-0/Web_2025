Anthony Mackie (Tupac, The Hurt Locker) plays Marcus, a former Black Panther who returns to his family brownstone to bury his father. But everyone he meets, from former militants, to the widow of his murdered friend, to a suspicious policeman played by The Wire’s Wendell Pierce, is still haunted by the revolutionary fever of the past. “Tanya Hamilton’s moving debut takes us back to 1976, when Jimmy Carter was about to be president, funk was king and the Black Panthers were trying to pick up the pieces.” - Salamishah Tillet, TheRoot.com 90 min. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2010) Written and directed by Tanya Hamilton. Music by the Roots. Cast:Anthony Mackie, Kerry Washington, Jaime Hector, Wendell Pierce, Jamara Griffin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nightcatchesus.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.nightcatchesus.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298339146000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295216404000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Night Catches Us</name><id>16071140</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298334600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/16071140/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
