<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It is all about Latin foods for July. Whatever you think Latin means that is the food to bring. Just not Mexican food. Think foods that make you want to samba, foods that speak to your hidden Latin soul!   &lt;br /&gt;If the weather is wonderful we will be outside in the backyard again (with Italian lights which are not Latin, except in the very strictest sense of the word).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a promise of sangria from one member already.I will be making ceviche.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now everyone should know the routine. Plan to cook onsite unless your recipe takes longer than an hour to prepare. If the recipe calls for unusual equipment bring it with you. Any doubts just email me. Remember someone will ask you how your dish fits the theme so have your answers ready!  Be prepared to share your recipe. Plan on making a dish to share that fits the theme. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are allergic to peanuts or anything typically found in Latin foods please post it on the site for everyone to see.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps if people bring what they want to drink and are willing to share.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All adult folk are welcome. This is a monthly event with a good mix of ages and personalities. Come join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hot latin nights</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216046718000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><why>This will be fun because food always brings folks together.
