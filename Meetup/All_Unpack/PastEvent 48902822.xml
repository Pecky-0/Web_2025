It is the year of the &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;Dragon.&lt;/span&gt; On Sunday, January 29 from 11 a.m. - 5 p.m., Boston's Chinatown will host a LION DANCE PARADE. It doesn't get much better than this!! According to Boston's Discovery Guide, "local kung fu groups perform the Lion Dance throughout Chinatown's streets. The "lion" visits each restaurant; when the restaurant owner comes to the door and feeds it, the lion bows in gratitude and then performs a special dance, accompanied by clashing cymbals, drums, gongs and firecrackers to scare away evil spirits. My plan: arrive, shoot and eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cell:&amp;nbsp; 603-812-5112.&amp;nbsp; Meeting Place for everyone else:&amp;nbsp; the Dunkin Donuts is next to the outbound/inbound orange line Chinatown T Station.&amp;nbsp; If you're going to be late, just call me and I will wait to be sure we connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone carpooling might meet at the parking lot across from the Ioka Theater at 9 a.m.; you should plan to leave Exeter at 9:15.&amp;nbsp; The train leaves Exeter at 9:30 and gets into Boston at 10:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;My thoughts for the day's schedule:&amp;nbsp; shoot from 11 - 2/2:30; find a great place to eat (ideas?) and be back in Exeter around 6/6:30 or so. &lt;br /&gt;
