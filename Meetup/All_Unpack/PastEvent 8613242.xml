Start the week off right. Come on, have some fun - just because you deserve it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. For more information see: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - the Orange Line Wellington Station - if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;Kevin&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wait at the picnic table for a few minutes; after 7:30, find me climbing.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin</member_name><member_id>4202767</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219879185000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219627675000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Climb</name><id>8613242</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219706100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8613242/</event_url></item>
