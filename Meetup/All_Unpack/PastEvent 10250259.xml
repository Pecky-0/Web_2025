We'll walk as much as the group wants to.  Don't forget your sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=42.414617,-70.986743&amp;amp;spn=0.010741,0.019312&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;msid=117398343489237033278.00046837e8f5a1c7196d5" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a google map of the 8.0 miles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be taking the T (Blue Line to Wonderland), but there's parking all around the beach.  Let's meet across the street (beach side) from the police station, which if you're taking the T is a straight line from the T to the beach.  &lt;a href="http://img525.imageshack.us/my.php?image=revere.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a pic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple places around for food too, if people are interested.  Kelly's Roast Beef is nearby as an option.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call/text my cell (you'll get it in email before the event)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241279025000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240491154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revere Beach - Blue Line (Wonderland Stop)</name><id>10250259</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240671600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/10250259/</event_url></item>
