<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We'll spend a little while meeting and sharing what's up with ourselves and our work, then Matt Bastide has generously offered to share his thoughts on Core Data &amp;amp; data modeling in general. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Core data is huge and a little hard to get into, even with Apple's built-in templates. This will be a brief talk to get people new to core data and data modeling started with building data driven apps in iOS.   Two excellent third-party libraries (mogenerator and Magical Record) will be introduced to help make working core data a little easier."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Matt! He's already provided me with a boost in that area, so I do think you will appreciate. Our host has offered to supply beer and I'll bring the nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us?  Please rsvp if you think the answer is YES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
