We'll have the projector, the banners, the handouts, etc. - but we need enthusiastic supporters to lend their time and get the word out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and comment on what days / times you can make it. You're going to have to pay the daily vendor entrance fee of $5 per day, and we're going to need to give them a list of who'll be coming WITH drivers license numbers. I believe they need them verify booth workers, because the rate is normally $10 and they don't want people taking advantage.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hebron Harvest Fair, September 6th through the 9th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours:&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, 4pm - 10pm&lt;br /&gt;Friday, noon - 11p.m&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, 9am to 11pm&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, 9am to 8pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:&lt;br /&gt;Hebron Lions Fairgrounds&lt;br /&gt;Route 85&lt;br /&gt;347 Gilead Street&lt;br /&gt;Hebron, CT 06248&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.hebronharvestfair.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189560226000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188520732000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hebron Harvest Fair September 6th - 9th.</name><id>6272555</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189108800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/6272555/</event_url></item>
