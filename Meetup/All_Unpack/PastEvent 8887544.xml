<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Continuing with our plan the text for the 2nd of our 5 meetings on Kant's Critique is the Introduction and Book I of Transcendental  Logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to volunteer to have a debate starter introduction. You can ask for a minute or 2 or 10 or 15 and the rest of us will volunteer not to interrupt with questions, certainly not with questions that would take the discussion astray from your line of thought. You can indicate your intention to the organizer and it will be put on this web page so no more than one person volunteers for any single meeting. Also feel free to let others prepare for the debate by letting everyone know your points via our e-mail list.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226018991000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223037700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kant: Critique of Pure Reason II</name><id>8887544</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224198000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/8887544/</event_url></item>
