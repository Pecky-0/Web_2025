If arriving later, just come find us on the walls. If you don't recognize me (see "Event Host" right) from my picture, just ask the staff at the front desk, they'll be able to point me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those less familiar, BRG has something for everyone, and a friendly community atmosphere. Pure slab, vertical, and sustained overhanging routes,&amp;nbsp;8+ cracks, dihedrals for stemming, laybacks, and more, for focused practice on different techniques. Over 40 topropes, 3 bouldering areas including a full bouldering room and a large cave, and sport leading on overhung walls and the ceiling. Leading the ceiling is a ton of fun, straight on or via the dark crystal -- it moves for extra challenge! From easy juggy speed routes to super hard, technical 5.13 and V10+ problems, you'll find it here. Let us know your interests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never climbed here before, you'll need to take &amp;amp; pass a belay test for rope climbing. Call the gym or see the website below for more info. Full-access Day Pass $16. Bouldering-Only Pass $14. If interested in regular workouts, I'd recommend checking out membership prices, definitely saves you money, and usually less expensive than other gyms.
