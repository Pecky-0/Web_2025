<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>As an IRN member, you are invited to attend a meeting on September 22 to address IRN's needs as it makes its transition to new leadership&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting is at 6:30 pm in the conference room on the main floor of the Enterprise Center.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Several people have stepped up to volunteer to work on various tasks but there is still opportunity for your participation. IRN has operated on a straightforward model designed to minimize the amount of work required. Assistance on maintaining membership and financials would be appreciated. Most importantly, if members would like to continue to have a newsletter, volunteers are most definitely needed.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have questions, please feel free to contact Karen Blanchard (khss10@juno.com) or Dave Cormier or Karyl Lynch at info@irnetwork.org. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This meeting is a working meeting, putting plans in place for the next several months. Your participation is appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Cormier</member_name><member_id>6323188</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285327748000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284928233000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Organizational Meeting</name><id>14823983</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285194600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/14823983/</event_url></item>
