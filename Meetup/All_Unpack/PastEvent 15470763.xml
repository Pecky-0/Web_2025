Every time she shifted the angle of her body, the shotgun shells in her pocket rustled like buckwheat husks in an old-fashioned pillow.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the same deadpan mania and genius for dislocation that he brought to his internationally acclaimed novels, Haruki Murakami makes this collection of stories a determined assault on the normal. A man sees his favorite elephant vanish into thin air; a newlywed couple suffers attacks of hunger that drive them to hold up a McDonald's in the middle of the night; and a young woman discovers that she has become irresistible to a little green monster who burrows up through her backyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns haunting and hilarious, The Elephant Vanishes is further proof of Murakami's ability to cross the border between separate realities -- and to come back bearing treasure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read and join our discussion of the following stories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wind-up Bird and Tuesday's Women&lt;br /&gt;The Second Bakery Attack&lt;br /&gt;The Kangaroo Communique&lt;br /&gt;Sleep&lt;br /&gt;The Elephant Vanishes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291080779000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289953513000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Murakami: The Elephant Vanishes</name><id>15470763</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290985200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/15470763/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
