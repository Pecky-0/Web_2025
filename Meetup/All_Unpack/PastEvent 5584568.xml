<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a spectator event but if you are brave..well then join in with the water tamers..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not picked out a meeting spot yet, so this is of general information as of now,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to hike at the McLean Game Preserve first then go to this event and observe near the finish area. I am expecting lots of people here so parking is an unknown factor...Heck...park anywhere and walk a bit.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i will just leave the website and let you decide..&lt;br /&gt; Perhaps a few of us can link together at the hike or here...about 12:30/1:00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scanticspringsplash.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.scanticspr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scantic Spring Splash is growing as a spectator event. Hundreds of spectators will line the Finish Area. Great fun for all ages to watch the canoes and kayaks come down the rapids just off South Maple Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boats will start to arrive into the area around 12:30pm - 1pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they mean the rapids area here...the finish is a bit further down and should take a bit longer i would expect....&lt;br /&gt;But look at the map on the web site if you are interested...&lt;br /&gt;Maps of spectator areas are available in the Race HQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541163000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174337968000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>River Splash on the Scantic River</name><id>5584568</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174710600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5584568/</event_url></item>
