It's hosted by the Dudley Library in Roxbury.&lt;br /&gt;(Silver Line T to Dudley Square, 5 min. walk to the library, past the Police Station)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a slide show and lecture about the history of the Roxbury area. The speaker is State Representative Byron Rushing, who is very passionate about history and has been active in community work for many years in the SouthEnd/Roxbury neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to attend this lecture and not the conversation meeting! You are welcome to meet as usual at Starbucks for conversation, or to meet at the Dudley Library to hear this lecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reece&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206828231000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205516812000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>3/27 2nd event- same night as English Meetup!
