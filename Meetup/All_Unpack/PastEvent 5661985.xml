This is a deep and profound experience of God that is available to anyone. Join us to learn more about awakening this true love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take place at 10am and go until about 1:30 with luch provided.  &lt;br /&gt;Cost is $30&lt;br /&gt;if you are from this meet up the cost will be $20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Light &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541273000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176346699000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mysticism and the Mystical Life</name><id>5661985</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177164000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/5661985/</event_url></item>
