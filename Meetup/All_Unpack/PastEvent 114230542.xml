&lt;p&gt;Then lunch/brunch somewhere nearby ~12, 12:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another sail ~2:30 in the afternoon, for a 2nd group of 7 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: some weekend day when the weather is nice, in early May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who sailed on 4/13, please wait a few days before signing up. I'd like to give people who haven't gotten to sail yet a chance to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll also create a meetup for the lunch. Do people have any suggestions, preferences? If we do dim sum again I'll probably choose China Pearl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description/details from Sail on the Charles I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I have a membership (and Sonar rating) at Community Boating, on the Charles river near the Hatch Shell. So I can take 5-6 guests out for a short (1 ~ 1.5 hr) sail on the Charles river.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The plan is, we meet at CBI ~10am, sail for a bit, then go someplace nearby for lunch/brunch. Should be about 15-30 mins to Chinatown if we want to do Dim Sum, if we want to do an American style lunch the Liberty Hotel is very close to there. If people want to put in the work and prepare ahead of time, we could even do a picnic on the Esplanade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When: Some Saturday or Sunday, when the weather is nice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where: Community Boating. Lunch/brunch location TBD (suggestions/proposals welcome!).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How many people can come: Only 6-7 people fit on a Sonar, so I can only take 5-6 people at a time. If we can find another person who has a membership (and has the proper rating) at CBI then we can take more people. If not, then I could take 5-6 people sailing before lunch, then 5-6 people after lunch, so maximum of 12 people get to sail. If you want to join us just for lunch, and pass on the sailing, that's totally fine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who can come: You should know how to swim. At least enough to survive for 5 minutes in the water in case you fall in, while I turn the boat around and come to get you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logistics: For directions, other info, consult CBI website: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://www.community-boating.org/"&gt;http://www.community-boating.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Best way to get there is by T - Red Line MGH/Charles stop. If you have to drive, you can park at the Mass Eye &amp;amp; Ear Infirmary parking lot. $7 to park there if I get your ticket validated at CBI. I don't know how many tickets I'm permitted to validate so please arrange a carpool if you're coming by car.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To bring: beverages and snacks to enjoy while floating along on the Charles enjoying the view of Boston. Sunblock. A padlock, so you can stow stuff you don't want to get wet in day lockers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And check back periodically - since this is a weather dependent event, it might happen with not much in the way of advance warning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
