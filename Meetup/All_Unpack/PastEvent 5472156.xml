It is a tell-all memoir that is as humorous as it is shocking.  There should be no end of things to discuss with this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the book took place in Northampton and Amherst we will be holding the meetup at a restaurant in Northampton called Fitzwilly's.  I have reserved some tables in the loft area so it is EXTREMELY important that you RSVP accurately for this event out of courtesy to our server.  Please also plan on arriving at least 5 minutes early for our seating.  You can check out the restaurant including the menu and pricing at &lt;a href="http://www.fitzwillys.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.fitzwillys.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Please note that each member will be responsible for paying for their own food and drink.  If anyone is unfamiliar with the location please send me a message and I will be happy to provide directions specific to where you are coming from.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you will be able to join us for our discussion of an interesting book at a great restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melissa</member_name><member_id>3059165</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174353471000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171213501000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March Book Discussion</name><id>5472156</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1173825000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/5472156/</event_url></item>
