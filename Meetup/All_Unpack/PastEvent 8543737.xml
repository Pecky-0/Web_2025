At Home reflects on, and celebrates, places, people, emotions and realizations that Cohen has encountered in his many sojourns around the globe, all the while exposing the innermost jubilation and contemplation of the bassist/composer. Stuart Nicholson, commenting on At Home, in Jazzwise Magazine, said &amp;quot;for my money [it's] the most considered and best realised of all.&amp;quot; Indeed, Cohen exposes his many gifts as a melodic composer, powerful soloist and provoking leader, as never before, reflected in the brilliant performances by the trio and ensemble. Whether in his adopted home of New York City, in his native Israel, or on the road playing this music (where he finds himself much of each year), Avishai Cohen is At Home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about Avishai Cohen here: &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/avishaicohenmusic" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy tickets here: &lt;a href="http://www.getshowtix.com/regattabar/moreinfo.cgi?id=1516" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.getshowtix...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be holding a Jazz Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232671393000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Jazz Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonjazz</urlname><id>87187</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Jazz Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218730690000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Avishai Cohen Trio at Regattabar</name><id>8543737</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220569200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonjazz/events/8543737/</event_url></item>
