Those of us who were there very much enjoyed it, and neeners to those of you who didn't make it.  Be sure to get your tickets EARLY for the next show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the details are confirmed I'll update this announcement, so consider this a HOLD THE DATE for those who didn't get to go this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you are not going, PLEASE change your status to &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;  I tried to save seats based upon the number of &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; I saw this afternoon, and far fewer people were actually there.  If you didn't get a ticket, it would be nice to change to &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; so that I wouldn't look for you at RAW.  At least one of you sent a comment/message, but it's not the same.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METROPOLIS&lt;br /&gt;With the Alloy Orchestra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alloy Orchestra accompany the fully restored version of Metropolis, the Fritz Lang classic dystopian epic.   Twenty-five additional minutes of footage, once thought forever lost, were discovered in Buenos Aires in 2008.  Now newly restored, Metropolis is being screened in its complete form for the first time since its 1927 premiere in Berlin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger Ebert calls the Alloy Orchestra &amp;quot;the best in the world at accompanying silent films.&amp;quot; The three-man ensemble work with an outrageous assemblage of peculiar objects. They thrash and grind soulful music from unlikely sources.  If you click the link above to the RAW website, they have a link to the Alloy site where you can watch them developing the score.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300634201000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288496096000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>THEY ARE DOING IT AGAIN!!  - "Metropolis" with live orchestra @ Real Art Ways</name><id>15283507</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300577400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/15283507/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
