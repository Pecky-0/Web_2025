This link is posted on the message board under &amp;quot;training for a 5K&amp;quot; along with information on the October 4th 5K in Braintree.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joggers and walkers of all levels are welcome to join us at your own pace.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week one training went great.  It was so encouraging for me in the early stages of training to see experienced runners finishing a full 3 miles! SO, we thought we could open this up more than just week 2 training (but I will have the whistle for people who want to follow the schedule).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to bring your sneakers and some water!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, July 22nd  &lt;br /&gt;7pm &lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School  &lt;br /&gt;Track  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fee: Annual Members - FREE, Members and Guests - $2 per person  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer(s): Julie &amp;amp; Amanda  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: At least 6 Yes RSVPs by 12pm/Noon on Wednesday, July 22nd.
