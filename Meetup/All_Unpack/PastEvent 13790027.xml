How about bold, bawdy, and just plain hilarious? Not afraid to ask tough questions that uncover the laughs underneath, Suzanne’s made a career out of telling the truth. And the truth is, life is funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After entering the world of comedy on a dare, Suzanne has been delivering gay material in mainstream clubs to straight audiences and proudly performing within the LGBT community ever since. She became the first openly lesbian comic ever to appear on television in 1991 on an episode of Sally Jesse Raphael entitled “Breaking the Lesbian Stereotype…Lesbians Who Don’t Look Like Lesbians.” She went on to become the first openly gay comic to host her own HBO Comedy Special in 1994, which earned her a Cable Ace Award nomination. Other television appearances include The Late Show with David Letterman, GSN’s remake of the classic game show, “I’ve Got a Secret” as well as HBO, Bravo and LOGO TV specials. Now beginning her 20th year of side-splitting merriment, she continues to forge new ground while enjoying her well-earned reputation as a pioneer on the lesbian comedy scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Any questions, e-mail BlushBoston@yahoo.com or call 617 877 1808.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Blush Boston</member_name><member_id>9405864</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277773023000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ladies having fun</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Ladies-LBGT</urlname><id>1456521</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>BLUSH North Shore Ladies LGBT</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276470810000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Suzanne Westenhoefer performing LIVE at The Hide Away</name><id>13790027</id><headcount>359</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277508600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Ladies-LBGT/events/13790027/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/2/global_11665426.jpeg</photo_url></item>
