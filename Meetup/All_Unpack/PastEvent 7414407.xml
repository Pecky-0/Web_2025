Sorry Im going to keep this one small but if this place turns out to be good (as Im sure it will) there will be more meet ups taking place here.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.metro9steakhouse.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Metro 9 &lt;/a&gt; and drool along with me  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will advise that we dress on the nicer side of casual - aka no ripped jeans or sneakers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COURTESY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a friendly reminder we would like people to be considerate towards the organizers knowing that some of these events take more time and effort than others by RSVPing accodingly. We know things can change suddenly but a nice one liner email/text/call explaining why you can't make an event or if you're running really late to event you said yes to would be ideal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules for Engagement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow meet up members participating in the event by arriving promptly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVP's are on a first come, first serve basis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment requesting to be placed on wait list. MAYBE'S will be changed to a NO the day of the event if the organizer sees fit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event is full and you wish to attend, please RSVP NO with a comment to be wait listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for THREE (3) events you will be removed from the group - all of us organizers talk so it may be a combo of missing more than one organizer's events or just one organizer's events - it doesn't take long to change your RSVP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's/event locations who's staff is based on our reservation - no one wants to be inconvenienced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the meal/event and you are not able to attend or are running late, you must call or text the appropriate organizer so they know what is going on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email the appropriate organizer about rejoining - if the event was run by X organizer do NOT email or complain to Y organizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your feedback is always appreciated, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward - if you have complaints please make a recommendation on how to improve the event OR better yet offer to organize an event with us and add your improvements to your own event &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving a nasty comment does nothing for anyone except offend people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your cooperation and hope to see you all at our events very soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will advise</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206315455000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Why not?</why><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204069980000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Metro 9 Steak House </name><id>7414407</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206142200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/7414407/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/2/global_2186386.jpeg</photo_url></item>
