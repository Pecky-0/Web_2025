&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the weather is not cooperating for Camille's today, but we will go again! In the meantime, let's head down to an old favorite and at least look at a water view from inside!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Monday Night Meetup series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurants and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Whiskey Republic, 515 S. Water St. (this is the area with a few bars across from Narragansett Electric and in front of the hurricane barrier on the water andn next to the Hot Club)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiskey Republic is where Fish Company "used to be". Of course the weather is not cooperating today to enjoy the deck, but the view is sure to be good. Many of us have been here before, but if you haven't yet, here's your chance, so let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And really, its raining. So why not come down and hang out with friends for fun and good cheer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE RSVP!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there! Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. Not even for rain!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a bright blue, gradated-dyed scarf, but we're hard ot miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
