So the unanimous vote was for restaurant 718... for 7pm on Monday.  The Manager's name is Benni so if he says &amp;quot;what reservation for 9??&amp;quot; we'll know who to complain to...   &lt;br /&gt;I usually give out my cell for meet up events in case someone needs directions, so it is 413-627-3484.... If you want to send me yours that will be cool, just in case I get there late (lol). Please note the address and the important info below!   &lt;br /&gt;Thanks,   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please Note To:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Email me your selection by Friday 12noon!   &lt;br /&gt;3.  Be absolutely certain that you are coming. &lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are no Last Minute Cancellations or No Shows permitted&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; for this event as ladies who are on the waiting list will loose their chance of taking your space.
