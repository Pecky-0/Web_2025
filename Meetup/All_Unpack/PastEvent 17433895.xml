But more importantly - what you would like to see it provide in the future. You will also get a sneak peak of the planned improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How cool would it be to have helped define the requirements for an important project with W3C. You would get to work with some of the brightest minds in web technology. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About W3C:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You've certainly heard of W3C. They are the international community that develops standards that ensure the long term growth of the web. (www.w3.org) You might not know that many members of their leadership team are based in Cambridge, MA working from offices at MIT. Several of their team members are members of Boston PHP.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread the word, get involved: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are hoping to get a group of about 30 attendees who are not afraid to speak up and provide feedback. The goal is to have attendees who can provide the most relevant feedback on the validation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
