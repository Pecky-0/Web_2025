So why don't we meet in front of the escalators closest to the main entrance off of Tremont Street at 6 PM.    Try to get there and have your tickets by 6pm.   If we go in to the theater too late we might not be able to sit together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lobby tends to be a bit crazy....I will be wearing a little movie fan badge so those who don't know me will be able to recognize me.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie we can grab a bite to eat.  There are several places close to the theater...we don't want to walk too far in this cold!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171342950000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170209366000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Because I said So</name><id>5439335</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171148400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5439335/</event_url></item>
