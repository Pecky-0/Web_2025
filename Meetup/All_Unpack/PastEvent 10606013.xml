It is a gaming system which allots points to each person, which can be spent on stats, spell-abilities, equipment, and any of a number of other dimensions of the character. Points can be increased by taking &amp;quot;disadvantages&amp;quot;, which also act as plot hooks for the GM. The wold is very large, flexible, full of political intrigue, small and large quests of a variety of sorts. My intent for the first meetup is for people to come over, see the books, get an idea of the system by making a character each, discussing the campaign, and then plan the first session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Time&lt;br /&gt;    Saturday, June 20, 2009 3:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Place&lt;br /&gt;    44 Phillips Street, Wickford, Rhode Island (my apartment)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>2523881</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245698077000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244493397000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuala Morn - Hero, 5th Edition, Fantasy Hero Supplement</name><id>10606013</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245524400000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/10606013/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
