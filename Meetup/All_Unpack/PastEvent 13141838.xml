Join us for a day of piracy, swashbuckling, derring-do, treasure-seeking and murder at Jennifer’s beach house in Old Saybrook! We’ll be transported to the small Caribbean Island of Santo Oloroso, where two fearsome pirate ships have arrived to avenge the murder of Captain Flint, or simply to try and find his treasure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interactive murder mystery and you will all be assigned an important character in the plot! The day will start with everyone receiving their character descriptions and instructions to play the game – once we start, who knows what may happen……kidnapping, secret alliances, and even murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly – we will have food! Let’s keep this one pot luck. If you need to warm something on the stove or in the oven/microwave, that’s fine, we just don’t want to be too distracted from the game. I have plenty of serving platters and bowls if it makes it easier for you (after all, beach houses are meant for entertaining!) So bring your favorite pirate “theme” food and your favorite beverage, and set sail for Santo Oloroso. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The festivities will begin at 2:00 pm and the game will start promptly at 3:00 pm and will last approx. four hours. Please don’t be late – every character counts in this game! Along with pirates, there will be Royal Navy, native islanders, a Spanish nobleman, a Colonial Governor, and of course his headstrong, yet desirable daughter!  To make it a little more authentic, please feel free to bring any costume pieces you think may add to the atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send directions to the house the week before the event. Yo ho ho and a bottle of…………&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join in on the fun; celebrate the changing of the seasons, the shore, and friends and of course the food!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer</member_name><member_id>3917688</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272910222000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270904199000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dead Man's Chest - a pirate murder mystery!</name><id>13141838</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272736800000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/13141838/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/b/global_14246219.jpeg</photo_url></item>
