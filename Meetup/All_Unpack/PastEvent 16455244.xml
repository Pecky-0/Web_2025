There is street parking if you can battle the snow mounds. It's next door to Duck&amp;amp;Bunny and a few doors down from Wickenden Pub. You can order food from United BBQ (with a discount) or if you get the munchies run over to a nearby restaurant for takeout and eat in the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably be there until 11, but won't be hopping.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for our pictures and we'll try to carve out a corner</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297700999000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Feeling a little stir-crazy and stuck inside?

Mix &amp; Mingle at Abe's. They were so nice to open up for us to have our holiday party, we should go back. It's a cozy neighborhood bar on Wickenden.</why><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296934209000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mix &amp; Mingle</name><id>16455244</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297470600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/16455244/</event_url></item>
