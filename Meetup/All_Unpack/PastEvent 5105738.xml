Our first meet up went well and we all decided we wanted to do it again soon rather than wait a whole month.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please come and join us we would love to meet you. It was really a pleasure to be with everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the Blurb of what we do for all the new people who we have not met yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to introduce myself to you, my name is Reverend Gabrielle. I am a non- denominational mystical Christian priest. I have been meditating for over 14 years and taught yoga for a long time too. I am eager to meet others who are interested in meditation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not be a christian based group but it will focus on learning skills to concentrate and relax so a connection can be made inside through quieting the mind and settling the feelings. Mysticism just means knowing through experience and what better way to experience God inside than through meditation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intention is to come together monthly for a Meditation and Mystical tea. This is what it will look like. We will start with a visualization or a short reading or subject to contemplate. After the meditation, we will discuss our experiences and talk about ways to deepen our practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting you all and will be happy to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, delicious tea will also be served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Light, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle &lt;br /&gt;617-852-2822&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540491000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156999287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meditation and Mystical tea</name><id>5105738</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158188400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/5105738/</event_url></item>
