We hike at a pace 50% slower than the AMC Trailguide book time.Hike ratings: easy, moderate, strenuous,very strenuous.We start as a group,we hike as a group and we end as a group. There are three other hiking Meetup groups if you want a faster pace or more challenging hikes (The New England Hiking Meetup, 4 Seasons Hiking Group, New England Over 40 Hiking Group). The hiking Meetup group,(Fellowship of the Tortoise) does easier,slower paced hikes than this group. Our goal is to stay fit while enjoying the camaraderie of hikers who have similar skills and goals. This is a dog free hiking group.Everybody must join the group and have a picture to be on a hike.If you are camera shy,print out a picture of yourself,and give it to me at the trailhead.The picture is to show Fish and Game if you get separated from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
