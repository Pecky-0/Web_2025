The opening will take place this Thursday (10/16) from 7-9 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are located at 167A Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington (one block before the Capitol Theater).  This will be a great way to meet other Meetup members and to enjoy the work of four highly respected Boston artists: Yossi Veissid (in his lat US exhibition before he moves to Israel), Jack O'Hearn, Kate Sullivan and Venessa Ly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through highly detailed drawings and paintings, Free Parking presents realistic and magic-realistic studies of buildings, transportation systems and social issues that define familiar and fictional urban environments.  The four artists in Free Parking have shown their work across North America, Europe and the Middle East, but this is the first time they have appeared in the same show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Kiely</member_name><member_id>6495837</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1302826239000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Creative People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCreative</urlname><id>919281</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Creative People</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284572950000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art Exhibition Opening - Thursday at 7 pm</name><id>16253754</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1302822000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCreative/events/16253754/</event_url></item>
