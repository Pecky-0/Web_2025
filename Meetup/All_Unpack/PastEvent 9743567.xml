Years later, when the very same rebels whom Sir William had amassed grow to be too powerful, he is called back to regain balance on the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is a reworking of the events of the the 1790s in the French colony of Guadeloupe. It was also meant to reflect upon the situation in the &lt;i&gt;Vietnam War,&lt;/i&gt; which was going on at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brando had the opportunity to have a role on &lt;u&gt;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&lt;/u&gt; but chose instead to work on this film. He also had to turn down a major role in &lt;u&gt;Ryan's Daughter&lt;/u&gt; because of this film's production problems.  In an interview with Larry King, Brando claimed that Burn! was his personal favorite film to have worked on. In his autobiography he claims, &amp;quot;I did some of my best acting in Burn!&amp;quot; Evaristo MÃ¡rquez, Brando's co-star, was a non-actor and a real-life sugarcane plantation worker. His role was originally to be played by Sidney Poitier, but Pontecorvo insisted on a non-professional actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this film is on a Monday night, and Mr. Zinn's presentation is likely to extend the showing of the film towards 10 pm, the meetup will occur before the film so that members can get a bite to eat and discuss the state of world affairs, their histories with Howard Zinn and Marlon Brando, and sit together for what should be a fascinating evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be at &lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Panera Bread&lt;/span&gt; across the street from the Coolidge Theater at 6:00.  Please join us whenever you can.  We will go over to the theater at 6:45.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will be at Panera Bread starting at 6:00 at a  table with a Meetup Sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234661309000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Burn!
