The result was one of the finest film interpretations of Shakespeare to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AllMovie Guide states- &amp;quot;In contrast to previous Shakespeare adaptations, it was fresh and lively--even challenging and daring--in its presentation and structure; it had fun with its subject, while other versions had been reverent and respectful; and it delighted audiences, scholars, and critics alike&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a complete review: &lt;a href="http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=2430&amp;amp;buy=closed&amp;amp;PID=10047237&amp;amp;Tab=reviews&amp;amp;CID=18#tabs" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.reel.com/m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brattle is also screening Olivier's version of Hamlet at 2:00 pm. I believe this is a separate admittance($) and would make for one long afternoon, although I might attend both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is the custom, I'll be holding a meetup sign near the front row after the movie and then we'll go to a local restaurant to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179262890000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177545594000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Laurence Olivier Directs Shakespeare</name><id>5709784</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179090000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5709784/</event_url></item>
