After nearly an hour dancing on the wire, he was arrested, taken for psychological evaluation, and brought to jail before he was finally released. James Marsh’s documentary brings Petit’s extraordinary adventure to life through the testimony of Philippe himself, and some of the co-conspirators who helped him create the unique and magnificent spectacle that became known as “the artistic crime of the century.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Winner, Audience Award &amp;amp; Grand Jury Prize for World Documentary, 2008 Sundance Film Festival;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Winner, Audience Award &amp;amp; Special Jury Prize, 2008 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever been to the top of the twin towers?  An experience that is forever gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that they made it nearly impossible to jump?  Barriers meant that you'd have to jump &lt;b&gt;out&lt;/b&gt; way too far to be able to clear the ledge.  There are efforts currently underway to 'protect' the Golden Gate Bridge in the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once got to the towers minutes before closing.  I only made it to the Windows of the World because I had a boy on crutches, with me.  Greatest invention, crutches.  Everyone got out of our way . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say if you threw a penny off the top (impossible because of the barriers) it would crush anything on the ground and bury it.  Makes me wonder why we don't take a bunch of pennies to Iraq and drop them instead of bombs.  Now, that is the kind of change I think we need to bring to Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't even comprehend what it must have been like to 'dance on the wire', but it seems like in many ways we spend our lives doing it.  Couple that with what happened on 9/11 and this film becomes an opportunity for us to watch, contemplate, and consider how precious life on the wire really is in a setting that overlooks the harbor, and the airport from which history was written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we'll seek refuge on the ground for discussion, perhaps at the ICA, perhaps at a nearby eatery like &lt;u&gt;Anthony's Pier 4&lt;/u&gt; or the &lt;u&gt;Barking Crab&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy on the high wire balancing a Meetup Sign over the Harbor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217977868000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216163307000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Man On Wire</name><id>8347609</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217790000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8347609/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/global_4806086.jpeg</photo_url></item>
