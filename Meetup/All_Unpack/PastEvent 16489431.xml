Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.livingforgottenrealms.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.livingforgottenrealms.com&lt;/a&gt; We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGLA1-2 At the Foot of the Lighthouse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sea of Fallen Stars is the lifeblood for many who live along the  coast of Aglarond, for the men and women who ply their trades over its  dangerous depths, the sight of a lighthouse means a welcome return to  the relative safety of shore. That is, of course, unless the lighthouse  in question is no longer dedicated to guiding travelers along the safe  path...&amp;nbsp; An LFR adventure for characters levels 4-7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELTU3-2 Blue Wounds (Heroic Tier)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the recent conflict against the Plaguechanged horde, the  paladins of Elturel find themselves and their city pushed to the  breaking point. The corruption of the Spellplague yet lingers in many  parts of the city, and Elturel's citizens feel overlooked while Torm's  faithful focus on vengeance instead of guardianship. In this chaotic  environment, hero and villain alike must seek ways to work together for  the common good -- or perhaps the appearance of charity merely hides an  ulterior motive. A &lt;em&gt;Living Forgotten Realms&lt;/em&gt; adventure set in Elturgard for characters of the Heroic tier (levels 1-10). This adventure is the first part of the &lt;em&gt;Controlling Chaos&lt;/em&gt; Major Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*********************************************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.  Please have a character pre-made as pre-generated characters will not be available.  Due to issues arising from previous sessions, if you do not come with a pre-made character you will be seated last at a table, as it's unfair to others who RSVP and are ready on time to have to wait and potentially have the adventure not finish in time before the store closes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297296717000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297181425000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms:  At the Foot of the Lighthouse &amp; Blue Wounds</name><id>16489431</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297292400000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/16489431/</event_url></item>
