It is open to photographers at all levels. You will be working in a fully equipped commercial studio &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Glamour-Photography/photos/612052/"&gt;(link)&lt;/a&gt;, using a full range of high-end studio lighting gear with experienced and professional models. Individual training and assistance will be available throughout the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will run 4 hours from 10AM to 2PM. This event will be limited to 12 photographers with a 4:1 (or better) photographer to model ratio. The event will be run such that each photographer will have focused time with each of the models. This means that no other photographer will be permitted to shoot while you are shooting. 2 or 3 sets will be arranged for multiple models so there will be plenty for shooting time and sets to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Meetups are characterized as having very attractive, professional models. We're working on some new talent for this seminar but here are some links to previous events: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Glamour-Photography/photos/680345/"&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Glamour-Photography/photos/641415/"&gt;Perstephanie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Seats will go to the 1st 12 paid attendees. (your RSVP &lt;u&gt;does not&lt;/u&gt; guarantee a seat, only fully payment will guarantee your seat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a free (no charge) pre-meetup workshop from 9AM-10AM to discuss and review studio lighting.
