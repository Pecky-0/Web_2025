<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We're getting close to the Fall of 2011.&amp;nbsp; Help send off Summer with a blast and welcome the down side of the calendar with a wine tasting event at Ralph's house in Cheshire on Saturday, September 17 
&lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; 6-10 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine (no boxed wine or 1.75MLs&amp;nbsp;please) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvres or desert.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;One group is setting up a fondue station so you can bring stuff to dunk in the cheese.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; Please indicate what food item
 &lt;br /&gt;you want to bring when you sign up. If you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is $15 or more with your dish. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $30 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group, to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste.&amp;nbsp; Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Reds - 
&lt;span&gt;Malbec&lt;/span&gt;, Blends, cab, merlot, 
&lt;span&gt;shiraz&lt;/span&gt; pinot noir.
 &lt;br /&gt;Whites - sav blanc, chards, reisling, pinot grigio, etc
 &lt;br /&gt;Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a persons spot if you do not show up.&amp;nbsp; If you must cancel, the earlier the better if there is a waiting list. &amp;nbsp;
 &lt;br /&gt;*Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already to all the "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence. It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly. I will have water and coffee too. &amp;nbsp; This is for&amp;nbsp;4 meetup groups and set at 20 people each.&amp;nbsp; Only sign up on one site if you belong to more than one for an accurate count. &amp;nbsp; See you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Someone's knocking at the door...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ralph</member_name><member_id>8774347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1316544611000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
