<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the new Mandarin/Cantonese PlayDate that will alternate in exposing our children to the Mandarin and Cantonese Languages.  It is co-hosted (experimentally for now) by MJ who is a native and fluent speaker in both Mandarin and Cantonese.  And I help provide the informal educational components in the form of a short group activity appropriate for all ages to promote the learning and use of the languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we will have story-time in Mandarin.  We will start this around 10:45am.  The activity this week will be decorating simple hand-puppets that will help with learning a song to sing in Mandarin!  Very easy to do for tots and even easier for Moms of infants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids can always free-play as desired.  If you have DVDs to share or information on links to videos in Chinese that are appropriate for babies and young toddlers to view, please bring them to share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breastfeeding-friendly environment!  Bring your baby's bottle/fomula or your tots lunch if you want to stay for lunch together. (And your own lunch too.)  I will have snacks for kids including a choice of juice or milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please just RSVP for yourself and you don't have to add "+1guest" for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Elsie's Cell:  508-202-0097 (okay to txt me)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elsie Smits</member_name><member_id>17363801</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350703814000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349968731000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mandarin/Cantonese PlayDate</name><id>qnhkmcyqnbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350657000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/86528212/</event_url></item>
