This month, Steve invites us to his home on the border between Hartford and West Hartford to share Latin food. Karen, the organizer of this special meet-up says: &amp;quot;Bring a recipe (with copies to share) or a prepared dish, or just come to see--and eat--what others bring.&amp;quot; Steve will supply the wine, and also invites people to prepare their dish at his house. He has most of the necessary spices--just bring the main ingredients. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve's house is on Prospect Ave between Asylum Aveenue and Albany Avenue (Rt. 44). Any questions, call him at 860-306-4300.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Dworski</member_name><member_id>2589505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200614799000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198026339000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Spanish Language January Food Fiesta</name><id>6935975</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200441600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/6935975/</event_url></item>
