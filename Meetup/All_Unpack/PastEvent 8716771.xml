Bugs should be done for the season, and brave swimmers would be advised to pack earplugs to limit earaches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My camp provides coffee/tea, lighting, fishing tackle and bait, refrigeration and cooking appliances for meals, and limited bed space on a half acre. There is space for about 4 tents outside. I have a fishing boat for anyone interested in a boat tour of the 14 mile waters in the front yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the distance into camp, I will meet inbound campers at the Blackbrook Cove campground at 10pm Friday evening and again Saturday (noon?). For drivers of cars with sufficient ground clearance, I can provide instructions to navigate the road on an individual basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you want to join the hike only we will meet at the Parmacheenee road on rt 16 at 10:30 am on Sunday morning. There is excellent parking area .3 miles in for people who want to head home straight from the trail on Sunday. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Magalloway summit is at 3360 feet and requires only a short hour hike.  (&lt;a href="http://www.firelookout.org/towers/nh/magalloway.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.firelookou...&lt;/a&gt;) It has a maintained fire tower which can be scaled to near top, even when the ranger is out. GreyJays are plentiful and will pluck apple cores from platform. Garfield Falls is a historic logging legacy and the stony scape is breathtaking and inviting. In spring flood it must be deafening and fierce. Another nearby falls could be added as the group wishes, called Hellgate Falls. In the logging days loggers where lowered on ropes to cut up logjams, or to place dynamite. Many loggers died in the attempt and the name seems therefore appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222137675000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220912183000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bullwinkle Weekend On Pristine Lake Aziscohos</name><id>8716771</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221928200000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/8716771/</event_url></item>
