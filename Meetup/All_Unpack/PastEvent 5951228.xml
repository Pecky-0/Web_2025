We do NOT have to attend the party at Milly's parking lot (for those of you concerned about their ban of open carry) or be on Milly's premises in any way. (Milly's is merely what draws the people and they come early to get a good view of the fireworks from Arms Park...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will instead be stationed along the riverwalk just to the left of the bridge that runs between Milly's and Arms Park. We will pack up the table before the fireworks start at 9:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP to jane at nhlibertycalendar.org if you wish to help out. We will be handing out official palm cards, bumper stickers, and displaying a large 4 x 8 sign. Bottled water will be provided. This is a go.&lt;br /&gt;Thousands attend this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See video of last year's celebration here: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqYx9qjzEVE" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185577978000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183085157000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester 3rd of July</name><id>5951228</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183498200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/5951228/</event_url></item>
