 &lt;br /&gt;

Cooking and Eating! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I'm truly looking forward to this - it should be a wonderful experience! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Ayurveda is the Art and Science of Medicine from ancient India. It is based on the elements and rhythms of nature as they exist in your individual body. For over 5000 years, people of all cultures including ours, have adopted this system in their daily lives to maintain vibrant health. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

In Creating Vibrant Health - Part II we will take a deeper look at a daily schedule based on your dosha, age and the season, cook and taste a basic meal. If you like, bring a spice or herb that you think balances your dosha! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This 1½ hour class includes: &lt;br /&gt;

◦ Review of principles of Ayurveda &lt;br /&gt;

◦ Review of Daily Routine – what have you incorporated and what is the impact? &lt;br /&gt;

◦ Cooking Demo – discussion on tri-doshic foods and spices that compliment your dosha! &lt;br /&gt;

◦ Discussion of Ayurvedic Lifestyle based on your questions &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

You will receive handouts with basic info, and have a chance to taste the Basic Meal. &lt;br /&gt;

Cost: $25 per class or $45 for both classes (cost includes food and oils) &lt;br /&gt;

pay in full by April 10th! &lt;br /&gt;

Cost after April 10th - $30 per class or $55 for both classes. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I hope you are enjoying the spring mornings with full sound effects! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

As always feel free to contact me with any questions. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Namaste, &lt;br /&gt;
