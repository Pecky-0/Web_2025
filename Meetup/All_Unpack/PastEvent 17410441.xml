<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Noble Japanese Hibachi has some good specials during the weekdays. I just called to confirm this. If you're into sushi, it's 40% off sushi night. Along with that its a great place overall. So come through and have some fun with others, have a drink or saki as the chef slices and dices our food then does the flaming onion volcano "choo choo" train thing. (you all know what i mean, lol)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those coming from Southern CT area. I'll provide car pooling from Exit 15 on I91 (Wallingford). Noble is inside the Walmart Plaza in Southington on Queen Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian&lt;/p&gt;
