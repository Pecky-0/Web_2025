This discussion will ask questions around vision and intention. Why are you photographing? What are you trying to show others through your work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynthia and Ken will each show samples of their photography and talk about what it means to them, and why they do this work. This will be an interactive session with the audience. The purpose of this workshop is to focus more on philosophy/vision/intention as opposed to technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Location info:&lt;/p&gt;
