&lt;p&gt;The second race of our informal 2012 TMIRCE racing season, the Super Sunday 5 is a new twist on an old favorite from our friends at RaceMenu, complete with a post-race party. It features a team competition (top five finishers including the top two female runners on each team count toward the team's cumulative time for scoring) and an award for the largest team in the 5 mile race, which goes from Kendall Square to Harvard Square and back. You can also opt to run 5K instead and take a party bus back to the starting area (no, seriously). When you sign up, simply choose to join as part of an existing team and select "TMIRCE" from the pull-down menu. Registration is only $25 until midnight tonight (Monday, Jan. 9). &amp;nbsp;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
