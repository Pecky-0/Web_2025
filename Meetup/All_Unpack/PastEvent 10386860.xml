In this one-day writing workshop you will be connecting to your passion, taking time to look at what you are doing and why you are dong it, co-creating a personal story with others, a story that you will share at the end of the day, and a story you take home with you. In the course of the day, you will develop deep listening skills, listen to the unconscious speak, and integrate what is important to you in your life in a novel way. Join me for an intense day of surprise and wonder.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come a 8:30 because we will start promptly at 9:00 and end by 6:00. Starting and stopping on time is important to this process. Bring a journal and your favorite art materials. Wear comfortable clothes. Lunch will be served.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about Birute Regine visit www.ironbutterflies.com or www.soulatwork.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>7932349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246844659000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242066688000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>One Day Writing Workshop - Reflecting and Connecting to your Passion</name><id>10386860</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246107600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/10386860/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/f/c/global_7505116.jpeg</photo_url></item>
