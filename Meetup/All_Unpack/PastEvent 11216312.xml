Pennock, a professor at Michigan State University, will deliver Quinnipiac University's 25th annual Alfred P. Stiernotte Lecture in Philosophy, &amp;quot;Design by Darwin: How Digital Evolution Is Extending the Darwinian Revolution,&amp;quot; at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 3, in the Grand Courtroom in the School of Law Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pennock is an expert on the philosophy of evolution and a noted critic of the idea of intelligent design. He gained national prominence when he testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School Board case in 2005. The suit, tried in the U.S. District Court in Harrisburg, Penn., tested the constitutionality of a policy put in place by the Dover Board of Education that required the teaching of intelligent design or creation science as a legitimate alternative to evolution in public schools. The court ruled for the plaintiffs in deciding that the teaching of intelligent design in public schools was unconstitutional since it is a religious doctrine, not a scientific theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information see &lt;a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x2518.xml" target="_blank"&gt;the event listing at Qunnipiac University's web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252191970000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251393445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Robert Pennock at Quinnipiac University</name><id>11216312</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252018800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/11216312/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/4/global_10415156.jpeg</photo_url></item>
