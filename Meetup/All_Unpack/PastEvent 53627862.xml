<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Don is hosting&amp;nbsp; a Texas Holdem game on the 18th, but it seemed like there was a lot of interest when he put out the poll so I was wondering if anyone not making into Don's game wanted to get together for another game on Sat 3/3 (this could be moved to Fri night 3/2 as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tournament style $20.00 buy in. I've usually played with $2000 chip stacks but can do $1000 as well, whatever people are comfortable with.&amp;nbsp; Split 50%/30%/20% depending on the number of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm good with chips and buttons, but I don't own a real Poker table(or table top or felt playing surface) yet so folding tables will have to do. I'd like to limit the first gathering to 12 just to see how it all works out (1 or two tables depending on # of players and seating comfort)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have some snacks but I'm not a beer drinker so BYOB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is in the driverway. There are a couple spots in front of the garages. My driveway is several hundred feet (and uphill) so it's best to angle park off the left side near the top on the grass. Snowy conditions will make the driveway situation more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone needs help with directions just email me and I can give you detailed directions.&lt;/p&gt;
