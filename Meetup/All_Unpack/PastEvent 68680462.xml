&lt;p&gt;We will meet at the Route 91 exit 9 park and ride (on the east side of the highway) at 10am.  We'll then caravan up to Sumner Falls and drop off the boats, then take some vehicles down to Cornish Landing to leave there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a truck or vehicle that can accommodate more than one kayak, please let me know (besides Nat, Joe, and John).&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342484408000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339429529000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak down the Connecticut River</name><id>68680462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342274400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/68680462/</event_url></item>
