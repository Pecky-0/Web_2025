To really help  you get the best shots,  there  will be a variety of quality tripods and  lighting equipment manufactured  by Manfrotto,  Elinchrom,  Metz and  more. The proper equipment makes a  cumbersome photo shoot more  streamline and you will learn directly under  Kathy's tutelage and have  the full array of loaner equipment on the  set. There will even be a  Manfrotto representative there to advise on  applications across many  different photographic scenarios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
