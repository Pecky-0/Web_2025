&lt;p&gt;Are you looking to restart your career? Searching for tips on handling a long commute or juggling home life with your career? Switching from full time to part-time work? Changing careers? Moving from working for pay to staying at home? Then come join us, share your experiences and meet other moms who are trying to answer the same questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the Net-Working Mothers subgroup is all about? We are simply a group of women who focus on supporting other members in their decisions to work for pay, in whatever capacity, and also to support mothers who are contemplating re-entering the workforce or changing their career path. Everyone is welcome to join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP so we can know who is coming.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334105891000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333422154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Net-Working Mothers Meet and Greet</name><id>59013292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334100600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/59013292/</event_url></item>
