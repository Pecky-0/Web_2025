We usually start the run on the bike path and go up to Arlington Center and then head back, about 4.5 miles round trip.  Then at 8:00 we'll stay for dinner and play Stump Trivia and compete for cash prizes and bragging rights.  Feel free to join for either the run or the trivia if you can't do both.  For those trivia buffs out there, we could always use people knowledgeable in the pop culture, business, sports, music, literature, science, and politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there this Tuesday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for people in running gear just outside the bar</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244759739000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244380158000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Training and Trivia</name><id>10595530</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244586600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10595530/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
