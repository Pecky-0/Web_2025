We are going to limit this first group to 15.  Here is what we will be doing.  First we will go through some of the tools and features of photophlow and for those interested in holding workshops or using this application as a place for photo review.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For next weeks meetup you will need to sign up for a free flickr acct.  Download a few shots you would like to review with the group.  After you have established a flickr acct.  we will provide you a link you will need to sign into NEPWs site on photophlow.  Next Wednesday at 8:00pm simply follow that link to the group page.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photophlow is set up as a virtual online chat room.  It was set up by flickr and designed for photographers.  You will be able to chat with one another and see one anothers photos.  There are also some cool tools for those who host a online event which we will go over fully next week.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256343385000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Photography-Workshops</urlname><id>1540111</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>New England Photography Workshops</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255574127000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Online Meetup via Photophlow and Photo Review</name><id>11630841</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256169600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Photography-Workshops/events/11630841/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/f/5/global_11231109.jpeg</photo_url></item>
