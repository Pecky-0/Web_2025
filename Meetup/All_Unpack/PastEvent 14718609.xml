The answer lies in a new paradigm that embraces purpose, passion, and concern for all stakeholders while remaining profitable. The new model empowers women to pursue ideas of social justice and environmental stewardship and create meaningful workplaces by speaking to the new trends of conscious capitalism, mindfulness in business, and authentic leadership in the networked economy.
