Being an accommodating soul I thought a mystery flight for dinner would be fun.  I'll plan a trip to a not-too-far airport that includes a local restaurant.  And that most likely means we've been there before.  Highlighting pens and rulers will be available for the few of us that still draw lines on sectionals (&amp;quot;all available information...&amp;quot;) as a backup to GPS and VOR navigation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the parking lot near the flag pole in front of the airport terminal building for a briefing at 5:30 P.M., then off we go by 6:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sam, for the idea.  See you on the 7th!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Louise Anderson</member_name><member_id>6714056</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278606397000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277332585000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mystery Dinner Flight to ???????????</name><id>13891752</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278538200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/13891752/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/8/1/global_15928737.jpeg</photo_url></item>
