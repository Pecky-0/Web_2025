A revered wild medicinal herb, SJW is much more than an antidepressant. The blooms start in late June and continue through July. Learn how to identify and harvest the plant along with a few of the uses for this wonderful gift from nature! We will also be watching for other edible and medicinal plants.  Our search for herbs will be in the meadow behind the historic Whipple house in Ipswich. We'll also take a quick tour of their herb garden and discuss a few of the specimens found there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optional follow up is a stroll across the riverwalk to visit the Green Festival!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loose agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:00- Meet and greet&lt;br /&gt;1:15- Move to the meadows to search for St. John' Wort&lt;br /&gt;3:00ish- Wrap up at the meadow and move on to the Green Festival &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please:&lt;br /&gt;Bring a pocket knife or similar tool&lt;br /&gt;Have a basket or a paper/ canvas bag for collecting (not plastic)&lt;br /&gt;Wear clothing &amp;amp; footwear for walking in high grass &lt;br /&gt;Be aware of the potential for ticks and bring insect repellant&lt;br /&gt;Bring a simple snack to share with the group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hanging about the herb garden in front of the house</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247936644000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234311608000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wild Herbs- St. John's Wort</name><id>9716431</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247418000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/9716431/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/7/global_7064327.jpeg</photo_url></item>
