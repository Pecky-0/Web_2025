Come out and wish him a Happy Birthday on a walking tour among his architectural masterpieces on Beacon Hill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Beacon_Hill" target="_blank"&gt;walking tour of Beacon Hill&lt;/a&gt; begins at Bulfinch's State House and roams among his other works including the Mason daughter houses, the 2nd and 3rd Harrison Gray Otis Houses, and the Swan daughter houses. You will also see the transition of early American architectural styles from Bulfinch's Federal style to the Greek Revival row houses of Louisburg Square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This walking tour is also a story of the creation of a neighborhood from its rural beginnings and through the vision of the Mount Vernon Proprietors the south slope of Beacon Hill remains one of the most valued neighborhoods in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour leaves from the Massachusetts State House on Beacon Hill at 2pm. Tickets are $12 (free for Boston By Foot card holders -- see www.bostonbyfoot.org about becoming a&lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt; Boston By Foot member&lt;/a&gt;).
