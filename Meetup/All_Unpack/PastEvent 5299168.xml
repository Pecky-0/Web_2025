Well Sevenender a local band to Cromwell, CT will be doing a reunion show at Rookies Bar &amp;amp; Grill in Cromwell, CT.  Doors open at 7pm.  There is no cover and it is always a great time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas day night is usually a busy time at Rookies and always a big reunion.  We will have the opportunity to eat, drink and dance at our leisure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of you will be away for the holidays but thought it would be a good opportunity for those of us who are around.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to call my cell at 860-614-9367 or reach me via email at chrsie@hotmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1167279355000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Classy CT Match Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Match-Singles-Events</urlname><id>357950</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>CTMatch Singles Events Music Dance Speed Dating Golf Comedy</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1164910036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christmas night to unwind!</name><id>5299168</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1167094800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CT-Match-Singles-Events/events/5299168/</event_url></item>
