She will begin the 38 mile walk early Saturday morning in Dover and end at the capitol steps at 10:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can show your support for Ron Paul by coming to one of the following locations on the route and encouraging Kelly on her walk. The media will be covering the event, so we would like to see a lot of supporters holding signs and handing out literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the locations and times:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irving Station at the intersection of Rte 9 and Rte 125 in Barrington: Kelly will be stopping here around 7:30 to 8:30 AM for water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susty's Restaurant: 159 1st New Hampshire Turnpike, Northwood: Kelly will be stopping here for lunch around 12:00 - 1:00 PM. Volunteers could join Kelly for lunch and/or hold a sign wave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom Traffic Circle: Kelly will arriving here around 4:30 - 5:30 PM. This is a high traffic area, so a sign wave would be a great way to increase awareness of Dr. Paul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capitol Steps, Main Street, Concord: Kelly will be ending her walk at the steps of the State House in Concord, around 9:00 - 10:00 PM.
