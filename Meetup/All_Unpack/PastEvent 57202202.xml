Considering people may be at different levels, why don't we run at a local high school track? That way, we can always be within 400 meters of each other!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm selecting Rockville HS in Vernon as the location, simply because I live in Vernon. However, I'm willing to change the venue to suit others who don't live out in the wilds of East of the River. Give us a shout in the comments. I'm all flexible and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3979797</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334501658000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>5K-Runners-Meetup</urlname><id>1354697</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>5K Runners Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332295476000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anybody up for interval training on a HS track?</name><id>57202202</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334413800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/5K-Runners-Meetup/events/57202202/</event_url></item>
