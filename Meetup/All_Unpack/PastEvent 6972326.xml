<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi Guys and Gals,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be playing another day of flag-football this Saturday @ 2PM @ Cambridge Common. It is about a 2 minute walk from the Harvard Square T-stop. Just head up the hill to the park (Cambridge Common) from the T. We encourage all skill levels to join us. We play to have fun, don't keep score, and again, have fun. The field will most likely have a feet of snow, so be sure to put on a few layers, definitely a few pair of socks, and gloves are a huge plus. We play every Saturday and plan to continue our events throughout the winter into the spring. Hope to see you all out there, and bring a friend if you can think of someone that may be interested.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please reply whether you will be attending or not, so we can we have enough people coming this week.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing everyone there this Saturday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Flag-Footballers&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>BK</member_name><member_id>4273085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199216249000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><why>This is a great opportunity to play flag-football, to get some exercise, and/or to meet new people in the Cambridge/Boston area.</why><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198705416000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag-Football - 2PM - SAT - Cambridge Common</name><id>6972326</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198954800000</time><rsvp_limit>26</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6972326/</event_url></item>
