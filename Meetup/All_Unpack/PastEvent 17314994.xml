The beneficiary is the Eduardo Zabala II Memorial Fund at Rhode Island College. Ed, a RIC student, was tragically killed in a car accident on Feb 26, 2011, and his sisters Carissa and Valerie who have long been members of the Sushi Meetup are establishing a fund to assist students in need, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds such as transferring from community college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to drop in anytime between 1:00pm and 5:00pm and stay as long as you like. Of course, the longer you stay, the more fun you can have. For those at least 21, the restaurant offers a full service bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE TICKET YOU BUY IS FOR ADMISSION ONLY, OF WHICH 100% WILL GO TO THE MEMORIAL FUND. ALL PURCHASES OF FOOD AND BEVERAGES AT THE EVENT WILL BE OPTIONAL AND SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN ATTENDEES AND THE RESTAURANT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to have you join us for sushi, but we understand if you are buying a ticket to support this effort in Ed's memory and will not actually be able to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can purchase tickets through Brown Paper Tickets using a major credit or debit card (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, Maestro, and Solo) with a $1.69 service charge:  &lt;br /&gt;Web: &lt;a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/172115" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/172115&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Telephone (toll-free!): +1 (800) 838 3006 &amp;mdash; event code 172115&lt;/p&gt;
