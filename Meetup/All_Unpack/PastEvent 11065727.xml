I know September can be a busy month with the kids going back to school, but this can be a wonderful opportunity to let your dog and yourself un-wind for a few hours. We will host the meet up from 1:00 - 3:00pm. Hope to see everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I will put out some beverages and some food to munch on. Also, If you would like your dog groomed after them meet up let me know prior to the 12th and we can schedule an appointment with 25% off discount. If you have any questions give me a call or send me an email.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255184907000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249755202000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Active Dogs September Meetup</name><id>11065727</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252774800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/11065727/</event_url></item>
