He's also offering 2-4-1 for the FIRST drink (so one free drink) and their usual happy hour prices on drinks (50 cents off domestic bottles and well drinks and 25 cents off top shelf.)  They have a whole computer set up process for pricing for happy hour, and unfortunatly they can only offer us special pricing on drinks until 7pm without changing the computer....but hey, at least we get a free drink! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>20</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187053096000</updated><rating><average>3.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185490914000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>8/6 - Monday Happy Hour - Christopher Martin's</name><id>6082177</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186437600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6082177/</event_url></item>
