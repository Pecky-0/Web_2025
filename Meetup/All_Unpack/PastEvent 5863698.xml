<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Ok, since I have to work this weekend, Saturday most likely and maybe Sunday too..??....So I can?t post a decent enough kayak trip.&lt;br /&gt;Most Likely next weekend will be Chapman Pond and WaleBone Cove located near the Goodspeed Opera House Or the Bantam River in Bantam CT..not sure yet.. If I dont work Sunday and its good out..then i will post one of em..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO instead wouldn?t it be nice to have a short hike to a nice flat area near the first set of open area at the top path of the Heublin Tower for a small dinner, snacks and wine (other beverage too for non wino?s) for a sunset socializing event?&lt;br /&gt;I don?t plan on going to all the way to the tower, but its an option if there is enough time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can?t stay up there too much past sunset since im not sure how strict the rules are enforced for a park closing at sunset?&lt;br /&gt;We can find out im sure?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting There:&lt;br /&gt;Look for the signs for Talcott Mountain/Hebulin Tower State Park area (south side of rte 185), its right across from Penwood State Forest if you missed it.. &lt;br /&gt;Go up the entrance way for a short distance, you will see the parking area off to the right across from the trail head on the left. I will have the Red Chevy Blazer with the plate WWU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is in an odd location for most of your routs of travel..&lt;br /&gt;Please check your maps.&lt;br /&gt;For Mapquest, GPS or others, 130 Hartford Road (rte 185), Simsbury, CT will get you close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181599301000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181189778000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Not Enough Time for a good Paddle Trip</name><id>5863698</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181426400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5863698/</event_url></item>
