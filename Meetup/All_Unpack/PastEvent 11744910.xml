Although our sympathy lies with the indigenous people and their lawyer, Pablo Fajardo, Berlinger presents this epic environmental law cases from multiple points of view, including interviews with Chevron-Texaco’s lawyer and environmental scientists. The case, whose battleground spread from the court to the jungle and to three different continents, grew to epic proportions, attracting media attention and celebrity involvement. “Rarely have such conflicts been examined with the depth and power of Crude. These real characters and events play out on the screen like a sprawling legal thriller” (Stephen Holden, The New York Times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/movies/09crude.html?scp=2&amp;amp;sq=amazon%20oil%20chevron&amp;amp;st=cse" target="_blank"&gt;New York Times Critics Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUITO, Ecuador — The multibillion-dollar legal case between Amazon peasants and Chevron over oil pollution in Ecuador’s rain forest keeps unfolding more like a mystery thriller than a battle of briefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since the oil giant released videos in August that were secretly taped by two businessmen who seemed to have the ambition of feasting off the expected $27 billion in damages sought, Ecuadorean officials and Chevron have accused each other of gross improprieties, including espionage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ecuadorean judge hearing the case recused himself after he appeared in the recordings discussing the case and potential damages. He was returned to the case by another judge, but he was then removed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two mysterious businessmen, who used watches and pens implanted with bugging devices to make the recordings, have refused to explain their motivations for going to the furtive meetings in Quito and a jungle outpost to discuss a bribery plot. And now, with questions mounting, one of them has enlisted a lawyer who has represented Barry Bonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent days the plot has thickened further. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Following the film, we'll go to a local eatery to discuss all manners of Crude topics.  Look for John to be holding a pathetic MEETUP Sign in the lobby outside the theater after the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;For those attending Tom's Meetup, &lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;1920's Dada Music Extravaganza&lt;/span&gt;, note that Discussion with the director follows the &lt;b&gt;Nov. 7&lt;/b&gt; screening of &lt;u&gt;Crude&lt;/u&gt; at 3:15 pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256854030000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crude</name><id>11744910</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258153200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/11744910/</event_url></item>
