Come down to the English Cellar Alehouse in Providence to play Stump Trivia! A beer, great conversation and a bit of good old fashioned competitive spirit is a terrific way to end the weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English Cellar Alehouse is a relatively new addition to Providence and boasts an extensive beer list (over 150 kinds) and a pretty good menu: &lt;a href="http://www.englishcel.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.englishcel...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trivia begins officially at 8 p.m. but we should probably get there early to get organized and order food and drinks. Please keep in mind that the game takes approximately 2 hours to complete and that teams can't have more than six people.  Let's be sure to form our teams prior to the beginning of the trivia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be shy! Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284408723000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Atheist</urlname><id>12929</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283137963000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society - Trivia NIght at English Cellar Alehouse!</name><id>14586383</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284332400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Atheist/events/14586383/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/0/global_13237216.jpeg</photo_url></item>
