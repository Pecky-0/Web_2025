We plan to visit the Chihuly Exhibit, an extraordinary explosion of glass and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, we will view the four floors of the new New Americas Wing a magnificent addition to our MFA containing some new and old treasures from both continents and four centuries of our own history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will make arrangements to dine together afterward when the group meets and expect to eat nearby after the MFA closes at 4:00 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan on going to the Chihuly Glass Exhibit at 1:00 p.m and recommend renting an audio set (cost $6 for nonmembers/$5 for members), which will provide you with information on the Exhibit and selected paintings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be helpful to know if you are an MFA member or a senior (over 65). As an MFA member, will you bring someone in as a guest? With sufficient numbers it may be cheaper to come in at a group rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBTA Green Line (E-line)on Huntington Avenue,limited on-street parking; however, there is a parking garage on Museum Road. Garage costs vary depending upon MFA membership and length of stay; maximum $14 for MFA members and $24.00 non-members. Car pooling is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>http://www.mfa.org/</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>4094202</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307988401000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Active "People" people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1425</urlname><id>1283834</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Sitzundjibers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306950820000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A visit to the MFA &amp; the Chihuly "glass fantasy"</name><id>20540921</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307808000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1425/events/20540921/</event_url></item>
