We will begin our indoor/outdoor season this month. I ask all members to please list which location you plan to attend in the comments section of your RSVP. This will help ensure that there's a &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; at each location. We don't want any lonely chihuahuas roaming about. For those who are new to the group, all members can choose to attend one or both meetups    (Boston common , meets near Boylston T stop on the green @ 11AM) and/or Doggie Day play center at our usual time of 1:00pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very special thanks to Kim and all others who take great photos for our website every meetup, check back often as your pet may be featured!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indoor meetup will be held at Doggie day &lt;b&gt;(1-3pm)&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should anyone have any questions, feel free to contact me. &lt;br /&gt;Susana&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2067938</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257697538000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Chihuahua Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>chihuahua-99</urlname><id>32412</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Chihuahua Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252858375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chihuahua October Meetup</name><id>11360371</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255273200000</time><rsvp_limit>45</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chihuahua-99/events/11360371/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/global_6840113.jpeg</photo_url></item>
