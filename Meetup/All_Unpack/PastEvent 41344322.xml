&lt;p&gt;I'm thrilled to announce the next Indoor Recess show, New England edition, at the Middle East Upstairs on 12/1! I first saw our headliner, Spirit Kid (Boston), gracing the main stage at the Harvard Mayfair and was blown away by their sound - a cut above the rest in the local scene, they bring a more modern twist to Beatles-style pop-rock. In fact, the Beatles' influence is a thread that runs through the styles of all three performing bands: The Russians (Boston) are another polished psychedelic alternative act whose songs could've been stripped straight from a Beatles album, and while newer to the scene, The Famous Winters' (Providence) debut EP is riddled with a grungy earnestness that will break your damn heart in the best kind of way. Show's 18+, tickets are $10 in advance and $12 at the door, but if you're a smart cookie you'll nab one in advance not only to save some green on the ticket, but to get 20% off food the night of the show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the bands here:&lt;/p&gt;
