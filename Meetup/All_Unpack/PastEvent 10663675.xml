The colonies have had enough with British rule and have started an uprising in Boston Harbor. The Tea Act that the British imposed on the colonies was the last straw. The colonists will stage a bold protest by trying to steal British tea and dumping them into the harbor. Will the colonists be able to break free and become independent or will the British be able to subdue the rebel colonists?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pre Reg*: $15/members and friends $20/non&lt;br /&gt;At Door: $20/members and friends $30/non&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous swordsmanship experience is not required. We provide the padded weapons (and spell packets). This is a family event with adults, teens and kids (ages 6+). If not in costume, Sweats and T-shirts are suggested. No shorts or tanktops allowed. Under 18 must have signed waiver by parents. 18 and over must have their own signed waiver. Waivers can be downloaded here: Waiver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $15 for Meet Up members (and their friends) who pre-register ($20 for non). Pre-registration required as these events DO fill up and we cannot take anyone else after our capacity is reached. To pre-register you must call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead with a credit card or cash. Make sure to tell them that &amp;quot;Meghan sent you&amp;quot; so that you get the Meet Up rate which is the same as the Member Rate (a savings of $5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: RSVP with YES does NOT PRE-REGISTER. You MUST call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead to complete the pre-registration process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At-Door is $20 and you may be turned away if there is not enough room. Since we fill up before the event more than 1/2 the time, pre-registration is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to be ontime for required safety instruction at start of event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247958951000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245168283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Battle Night: Fight for Independence</name><id>10663675</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247266800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/10663675/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/9/global_6162841.jpeg</photo_url></item>
