The day was a great success thanks in large part to Tracey.  &lt;br /&gt;As a show of appreciation she has invited us all to a cook out/ pool party at her house at 304 High Street in Randolph.  The pool party is on Wednesday the 26th.  Anyone interested in going can show up any time I'm going to say after 2.  Come with something extra if you wish, but she said she will have burgers and dogs, potato salad, green salad etc.  I'm going to offer to bring soda.  &lt;br /&gt;I know she will make it a wonderful day in appreciation of what we did for her so PLEASE drop by if you can.  She is a super sweet lady.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants to try to organize a short group ride(s) to arrive with style in groups, please email Tracey ASAP so she can send it out to all members.  &lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Paula&lt;br /&gt;PS Bring your bathing suits to work and come for a dip and some dinner on your way home.  Nice end to the day.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey Juda</member_name><member_id>9039356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252844787000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251131936000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Berta's Cookout</name><id>11186681</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251309600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/11186681/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/b/global_9177195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
