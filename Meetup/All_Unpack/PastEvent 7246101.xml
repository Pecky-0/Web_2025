As someone who listens to online radio this event sounds rather interesting.  Below is part of the updated email I received from Pandora with a description of the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This get-together is a free event, open to everyone. It's a chance for me to share our story with you and hear what you have to say. I'll tell you about the Music Genome Project's beginnings, living through the dot-com collapse and what this last whirlwind year has been like. Most of all I'd like to get your ideas and thoughts about the service and where you think music is headed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet in front of the Boston University Morse Auditorium at 6:45.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204328757000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201935982000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pandora Internet Radio Discussion</name><id>7246101</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204155900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/7246101/</event_url></item>
