That's the slogan on the menu at &lt;a href="http://www.peppercornz.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Peppercornz on Main&lt;/a&gt;, which moved from cramped quarters on Columbian Avenue in Weymouth to take over the space formerly occupied by Reggio in September of 2008. All available evidence seems to indicate that quite a few people concur with the sentiment; among them the &lt;a href="http://www.patriotledger.com/entertainment/dining/x776468111/TASTE-TELL-Peppercornz-on-Main" target="_blank"&gt;Patriot Ledger's Mimi Claffey&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, the &lt;a href="http://www.phantomgourmet.com/Showpage.aspx?content=ReportCard&amp;amp;id=3846" target="_blank"&gt;Phantom Gourmet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you make yet another Italian restaurant on the South Shore something special?
