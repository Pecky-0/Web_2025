&lt;p&gt;The poll for this month was a tie! So we are going to read both books! One this month and one for December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book for November is going to be Mogworld by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw. From the Amazon page: "In a world full to bursting with would-be heroes, Jim couldn't be less interested in saving the day. His fireballs fizzle. He's awfully grumpy. Plus, he's been dead for about sixty years. When a renegade necromancer wrenches him from eternal slumber and into a world gone terribly, bizarrely wrong, all Jim wants is to find a way to die properly, once and for all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at &amp;nbsp;Rodney's Bookstore on Mass Ave. There is parking around the corner on Green St. ($8 for the night). There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;See you there!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
