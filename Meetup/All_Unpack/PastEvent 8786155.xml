The orchard will donate the apples, but we need volunteers to pick them. Word is that the apples are still dripping from the trees! Children five years and older are welcome to come with their parents. Foodshare needs a completed volunteer information form for each person, which Gloria can e-mail to you when you RSVP. Here are the details: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: 2 Clark Hill Road, Glastonbury&lt;br /&gt;Date: September 27th from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP or contact Gloria if you are planning to join us that day, so Foodshare is prepared for the right-sized group!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222899602000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221777145000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Apple picking for Foodshare</name><id>8786155</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222534800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/8786155/</event_url></item>
