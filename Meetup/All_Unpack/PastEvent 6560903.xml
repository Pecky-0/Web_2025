We will have lunch at the cafeteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Paul is planning on video-conferencing with us, since the Concord HQ meetup got a telecon as a prize for donations. He could be subject to last minute schedule changes, but for now, we are expecting the video conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location will be the New Hampshire Technical Institutes' Sweeney Hall Auditorium in Concord, NH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have some activities planned for Sunday for those that can spend an extra night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE SIGN UP FOR THIS EVENT ASAP.
