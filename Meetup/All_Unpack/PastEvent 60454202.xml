<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This group typically doesn't meet in July or August due to the heat and humidity in the ole Town Hall, and since so many of us are off on, or recovering from, vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you stuck around town the third Thursdays of July and August, come meet for a much more informal and intimate gathering near the beach in Rye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own Jonathan has graciously offered the use of his sizable patio, with a large fire pit surrounded by a dozen Adirondack chairs. There's a cabin or the property capable of holding most, if not all, of us in case of inclement weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll provide burgers and dogs, please bring snacks, food for the grill, and/or whatever beverage you prefer to drink and share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early and walk the beach (only two blocks away), or catch the sunset when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no agenda, though the normally taboo subjects of American Idol and country music remain off limits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park on Perkins Road or Maple Street. The house is a white cape with big deck and American flag on the corner of Perkins and Maple, two blocks from the beach.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>4289009</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343260601000</updated><rating><average>4.92000007629</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Photography Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastPhotographers</urlname><id>1528260</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast Photographers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334340606000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Photo Pub Night Meeting</name><id>60454202</id><headcount>28</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342737000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastPhotographers/events/60454202/</event_url></item>
