It currently caters to over 4,000 individuals involved with the biotech field by hosting monthly events that have an average turnout of 150-200 people. Our philosophy is that we offer no lectures or agenda to follow as we look to offer a pure networking experience to all. In order to be on the list for this event, you MUST register through our website which allows for free admission to all events. This also will allow us to keep you up-to-date on upcoming events as they present themselves. Otherwise, there will be a $20 charge at the door to attend. For more details, check out www.biotechtuesday.com. Individuals or companies who may have any questions or interest in sponsoring furture events, please contact Josh Lang at lang.josh@yahoo.com.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297818797000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Networking event for all those involved in Biotech in some way or another.</why><group><who>Biotechnology Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>biotech-31</urlname><id>178843</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Biotech Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297143238000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biotech Tuesday</name><id>16486328</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297814400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/biotech-31/events/16486328/</event_url></item>
