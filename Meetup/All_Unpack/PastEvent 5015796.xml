Since our discussions in previous meetups have tended to go off into left field, we have decided to discuss Objectivism: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand.  In August, we'll focus on Chapter 2 and revisit Chapter 1, which we discussed with the help (of a study guide) in July.  This is pretty heavy reading, so we're taking our time on it to make sure we understand the axioms on which her philosophy is based.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The point of the group is to meet other folks interested in Ayn Rand's philosophy and grow in your understanding of it.  Feel free to come with as little or as much knowledge of Ayn Rand as you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll hope to see you the FIRST Sunday of August... August 6, at 5PM in the basement of Starbucks on Boylston at Berkeley!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pay meetup.com $19.00 per month to use their site, but for me, this is a small price to pay for the opportunity to meet other people interested in Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand.  However, if anyone would be willing to donate a dollar or two to help me defray the monthly expenditure, that would be great.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152482456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand August Meetup</name><id>5015796</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1154898000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/5015796/</event_url></item>
