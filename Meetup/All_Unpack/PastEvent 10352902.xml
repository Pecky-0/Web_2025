From the Boston Garden along the Bulfinch Triangle, over the Charles, and to U.S.S. Constitution, you will experience the art, technology, and nature of this historic area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the tour we will get a close up view of Boston's new cable-stayed landmark, the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge, the locks of the Charles River Dam, and the revitalization of the lower basin (once called the Lost Half Mile). Not to mention, discuss the alewife herring and its anadromous behaviour, the harbor crossing of a certain Mr. Revere and the exploits of the Boston Ice King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small area of Boston is packed with amazing things to see! Bring along some water and enjoy a real journey of discovery. The tour lasts 90 minutes and costs $12 ($5 for card carrying &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot members&lt;/a&gt; -- see &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org" target="_blank"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to join). We will meet at the corner of Portal Park on Causeway Street - just next to the North Station T entrance kiosk closest to the Boston Garden.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for folks with BBF badges, hats and bags...standing near the park</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246877086000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241631831000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boats, Bridges &amp; Locks tour</name><id>10352902</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246456800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/10352902/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/2/e/global_8513678.jpeg</photo_url></item>
