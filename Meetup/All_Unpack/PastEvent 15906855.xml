&lt;p&gt;The first theme of this party is dreams. What would be dreamy to you? Feel free to explore your creative edge. Here are some of the things we may do. Wear dream costumes, sing dream songs, eat dream food, play dream games, tell fortunes, listen to dreamy music, tell dream stories, and talk about dreams. We will have costumes, dream games, dream cards, oracle cards, and fortune telling cards at the party to play with. Please feel free to bring your own dream paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second theme of the party is the number 2, so feel free to bring two of something. Two rocks, two feathers, two turtle doves, two shoes, two dreams, or two twins if you know any!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a vegetarian potluck, so bring some yummy vegetarian food to share. There will be plenty of opportunity to share dreams and talk about dreams. Anyone who wants to may share their New Year dream experiences. You are welcome to bring your friends! The more the merrier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 6 PM - 12 Midnight. This is a party, so you can drop in whenever you feel like it. We will be meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
