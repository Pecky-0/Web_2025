As always there will be free booze and free food that has been picked over by hundreds of vultures aka our fellow New Haven residents.  This event is from 5-8.  Not sure when I can get there but just like last year this is not an event like happy hour where you look to seek out and meet up with your fellow NHCer's.  It is usually packed and crazy.  I suggest if you like art or things that are supposed to be art just go check it out.  Having said that I will be there if you want to say hello.  My cell is 203 525-5670 and my name is Chris.  Location is artspace.  50 Orange Street.  Elm City, CT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artspace?s 10th Annual City-Wide Open Studios is a 20-day celebration of contemporary art in all its myriad forms. From October 9-28, 2007, meet over 500 artists, visit studio sites, and see art being made in New Haven, CT.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192395840000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191775209000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>I could have painted that!</name><id>6505625</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192222800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6505625/</event_url></item>
