The Breakfast Club will meet each month for a meal at a new restaurant and an activity afterwards.   This month will be the Delaney House. The food at the Delaney House is very good.  It also has one of the best buffets in the area.  Combine this with their excellent service and believe me you will be good to go.  The group will then mosey on up to the Summit House at Skinner State Park in Hadley for the spectacular view.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222340489000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219535360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Breakfast Club</name><id>8606772</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222005600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/8606772/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
