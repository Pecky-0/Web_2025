&lt;p&gt;I have never been to Plum Island, so the best meeting location I can find is&amp;nbsp;at Plum Island center beach, turn right on Southern Boulevard.&amp;nbsp; Follow the road to the end where you'll see a parking lot on the left and a sign for $10 parking. (no charge off season)&amp;nbsp; The road curves around the parking lot and goes past the Blue Hotel (so I read, at least) but you can pull into the parking lot on this side.&amp;nbsp; If anyone has a better meeting location, please feel free to make a suggestion!&amp;nbsp; I will be bringing my dog, and believe they are allowed off leash at the beach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll collect a dollar towards meetup fees from every&amp;nbsp;one.&amp;nbsp; THanks!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329788939000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329441809000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday afternoon walk....PLUM ISLAND is the place :)</name><id>52671312</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329678000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/52671312/</event_url></item>
