&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will follow Avalon trail, A-Z trail and Mt Tom Spur to Mt Tom&amp;nbsp; Willey Range Trail to pick up both Mt Field and Mt Willey.&amp;nbsp; Then return via Willey Range Trail and Avalon trail. &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This will be a slow/moderate pace hike will cover about 10.0 miles and climb about 3,400 feet &amp;ndash; it is considered INTERMEDIATE because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain. It should take an average hiker about 6 hours 40 minutes to complete this trip&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;(I'm thinking more like 8 hours, no need to rush and hopefully new hikers will find this enjoyable)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you. Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you. The goal of this hike is to summit safely, and to do that, everyone in the group needs to be at a similar fitness and experience level. If you have ANY questions about your ability to participate in and complete this entire event please contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. Winter hiking is more strenuous than hiking in the summer. We will assess travel and weather conditions and make changes to our planned trip as necessary - &lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;"Reaching the summit is optional, getting down in mandatory" (Ed Viesturs). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list describing the minimum clothing and equipment required to participate in this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sturdy hiking boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic shirt and pants, including at least one insulating layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterproof rain jacket (with hood) and pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-energy snacks, food for lunch and water.&lt;/p&gt;

Toilet kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items). Sunscreen. Lip balm. Waterproof cover for your pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
