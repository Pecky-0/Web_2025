They have DJs on various nights. Some may characterize this as the local 'punk' or rock-a-billy bar but we all seem to fit in. On the last Wednesday of every month is a great DJ playing old alternative classics (and he takes requests). Trying out this place the night before Thanksgiving, the guy checking IDs at the door was wearing a kilt and the two guys behind the bar were very attentive. The crowd filled up the space comfortably so Astronomer Mike of P-collective and I decided to post this as an event for December for both meetup groups. You might want to wear black but it's not required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are around, and think this could be a place to check out or up your alley, please join in.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262398105000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259710453000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scurvy Dog - Dec. 30</name><id>11994078</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262224800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11994078/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
