&lt;p&gt;This ridiculous, over-the-top spoof of dance movies was produced by the members of the Upright Citizens Brigade. Its plot is pretty much what you’d expect: a spoiled rich girl yearns to be a dancer and finds freedom in the underground dance world but, when tensions rise between two rival crews and a dance-off is imminent, she finds herself caught in the middle. The delivery, however, is totally, hilariously, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the director will be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you RSVP yes, let me know if you would like to meet ahead of time to get a bite to eat.  I'm partial to Charlie's burgers, but I know that I'm a group of one.  Would be happy to compromise and pick another place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is 90 minutes long, so it's possible I'll have enough energy to go for a movie discussion after at 9:30.&lt;/p&gt;
