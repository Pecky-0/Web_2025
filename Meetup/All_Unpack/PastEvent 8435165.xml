The idea is that young professionals from different building industry backgrounds will plan tours, events, workshops and/ or other fun activities for the larger YPNet community. They will also make sure to plan for future leadership so that when people cycle off, others will take over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in participating in in &lt;b&gt;YPNet Leadership&lt;/b&gt; please come to a planning meeting at the BSA. All are welcome- membership is not required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to RSVP to the BSA by noon on the day of the meeting to insure ample pizza and beer: bsa@architects.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Take the elevator to the 5th floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda Solinsky</member_name><member_id>5258600</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jonathan Taylor</member_name><member_id>5351739</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alyson</member_name><member_id>5616452</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218233121000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Design Build Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonarchitects</urlname><id>696342</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Architecture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217348727000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>YPNet Leadership Planning Meeting</name><id>8435165</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218060000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonarchitects/events/8435165/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/global_4332225.jpeg</photo_url></item>
