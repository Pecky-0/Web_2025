 If you've ever been backpacking, you've probably heard people boast that their pack weighs 50 or 60 lbs. Those days are over. With a little knowledge and careful gear selection, it is possible for anyone to reduce their pack weight to a comfortable 20 or 25 lbs, even for a week long trip. By carrying less weight in your pack, you can hike further, see more, experience less fatigue, and prevent injuries.&amp;nbsp;In this talk, Philip Werner will discuss a number of different strategies for reducing your gear weight and demonstrate some of the cutting edge gear used by lightweight and ultralight hikers, including products from leading manufacturers, both small and large, that are leaders in the lightweight backpacking revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
