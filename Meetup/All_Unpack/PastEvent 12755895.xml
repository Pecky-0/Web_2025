It's starting to get warm outside, and i'm starting to get the itch to go outside and play.  So, I'd like to hear from you to see what kinds of trips you'd like to see happen with the group over the spring and summer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;In truth, I've always wanted for this group to be more than just climbing.  I'd really like for us to go backpacking, rafting, kayaking, hiking, and anything else outdoors - - but all this does require some planning on our part.  Hence this meeting!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, it'll be a good time.  Please come out and join us!    Venue is Archie Moore's - we all know and love it.  If there is an overwhelming response then I might need to change to larger venue, PLEASE RSVP EARLY so i can get a head count.  Archie's is great, but they don't like to be sprung upon by 20 ppl - as i found out one night... :-P&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anyway, please come, RSVP SOON PLEASE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;-Dan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask for Dan, or look for the crowd.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Jeanette</member_name><member_id>8934370</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268356136000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctrockclimbing</urlname><id>1388805</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>CT Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267541558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Food, Beers, Climbs, Ideas, Hikes...</name><id>12755895</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268182800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ctrockclimbing/events/12755895/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/global_13404020.jpeg</photo_url></item>
