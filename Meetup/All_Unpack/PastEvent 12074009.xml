Joey and I will make gingerbread cookies and we can all decorate them for children at a local homeless shelter. We'll make extras for everyone to enjoy them and take some home. We'll also have supplies for people to make cards to send to friends and family. I've contacted an organization so we can also send cards to the troops overseas. We need to make sure they feel the love, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's have a pot luck style dinner so we can taste each other's delicious culinary abilities! Whoever makes the best spiked egg nog gets a prize....I'll be the official tester :-) Let me know what you're going to bring when you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cammy&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261438910000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Smiling Happy Faces</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford</urlname><id>1498492</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>Eat, Laugh, and Be Merry in West Hartford</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260676620000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Give the Gift of Good Food, Gingerbread People, and Pretty Cards!</name><id>12074009</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261265400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford/events/12074009/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/e/7/global_9949255.jpeg</photo_url></item>
