 &lt;br /&gt;Building Blocks: The Real Dirt on the Back Bay, from the Civil War through the Gilded Age
 &lt;br /&gt;September 5, 2011
 &lt;br /&gt;10:00am-3:00pm
 &lt;br /&gt;Admission: $20 general public ($5 for BBF members)
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Between the Civil War and the end of the 19th century, Boston underwent stunning changes and emerged as a great metropolis; the creation of the Back Bay was part of the city&amp;rsquo;s metamorphosis. Building Blocks: The Real Dirt on the Back Bay will dig beneath the surface to reveal the architectural landscape as it developed, starting from the early houses on Beacon Street and ending with the grand mansions of the late 1800s on Commonwealth Avenue. &amp;nbsp;Our expert Boston By Foot tour guides will also unearth stories of famous and not so famous Bostonians and their passions: scholars, poets, railroad magnates, and humanitarians, feminists and firebrands. We'll discover how Boston changed drastically after the Great Fire of 1872, when the old Puritans and the new money lived side by side on the glorious site of a once fetid swamp.
 &lt;br /&gt;
