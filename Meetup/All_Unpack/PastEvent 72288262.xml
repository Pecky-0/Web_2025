More praise for The World Peace Diet: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

One of the most important books of the 21st century.” -- Norm Phelps, author, The Dominion of Love and The Longest Struggle, &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

and others &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Absolutely the BEST book EVER on the spiritual connection to what’s on our plates. This is my favorite book in YEARS. A must.” -- Meria Heller, radio talk show host &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Will Tuttle, the author of this eloquently written book, challenges our thinking about our relationship to non-human animals with respect, sensitivity, and grace. His understanding of the human psyche is deep. His use of language is divine, and his compassion reaches out and jumps off each and every page. I highly recommend this book, and I dare you to not be moved by its gentle power.”Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, author and host of Compassionate Cooks &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“A profoundly insightful and important book, The World Peace Diet is sure to be a catalyst and important tool in the evolution of human consciousness.”-- Satya Magazine &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Use The World Peace Diet as a guide to empower yourself and others in making dietary choices that are powerful beyond what you can possibly imagine.”Julia Butterfly Hill, famed environmental activist, author, and founder, Circle of Life Foundation &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Will Tuttle brings a priceless perspective—not only to the planetary crisis confronting us all, but also to powerful ways we each can affect it. This book is radiant with his learning and his compassion.”Dr. Joanna Macy, noted author, lecturer, educator, and peace activist &lt;br /&gt;

“I believe The World Peace Diet is the most important book of the 21st century. If you read but one book in your life, make it The World Peace Diet.”James Macy, M.D. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Will Tuttle speaks with a prophetic voice for those in our world who have no voice. I find this book to be the clearest and most complete case for ethical vegetarianism that I have ever seen. I admire him for the courage and the skill to state his case in a very clear and compelling way. A landmark publication.”Rev. Robert J. Brumet, Faculty, Unity School of Christianity &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“The World Peace Diet presents what is probably the most comprehensive case yet for eating a diet, and creating a society, free from cruelty and violence. Its central focus is the idea that cruelty to animals (particularly farmed animals) sets a tone in our society that plays out in interpersonal violence, war, and environmental destruction. It is a provocative thesis, one that merits the attention of all who claim to value life.” -- Dr. Daniel Redwood in Pathways Magazine &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Stripping away delusions and rationalizations, The World Peace Diet powerfully presents the connections between our current food choices and so many of the problems we face with our health, our environment, our politics, our society--and our spirits. Dr. Tuttle provides the understanding of why and how a change to a truly health supporting--and life affirming--way of eating can enable us to thrive as individuals--and to survive as a society.“Profound, passionate--and ultimately hopeful and inspiring--Will Tuttle's The World Peace Diet should be required reading for students everywhere--and for all people with inquiring minds and open hearts. I recommend it most highly.”Michael Klaper, M.D., noted author, lecturer, and health researcher &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“Thought-provoking and recommended for most collections.”-- Library Journal &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“I am grateful for this powerful and cogent book. It has stretched my thinking (and heart) about animals, compassion, and our society.”John Mackey, Founder and C.E.O., Whole Foods, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
