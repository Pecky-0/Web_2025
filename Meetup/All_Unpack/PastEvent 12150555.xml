In his short life, he wrote dozens of books, some of which are lost, and some became curriculum classics for generations of students of mystical Judaism around the world. Greatest mystics of later generations, the elders, said that if Ramchal would live in their days, 'they would walk to sit at his feet and learn from him'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will learn about Kabbalah Fundamentals as presented by Ramchal: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Creator &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Man &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Human Responsibility &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Spiritual Realm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start to learn about kabbalistic concepts of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; the 'System of Providence'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; the levels of the Soul  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; the realms of our existence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help us connect the dots in between mystical traditions and inner work / personal growth work, we will start to employ the system of self-mastery by brilliant spiritual teacher of our times, IsanaMada -- Maya Riley, 'A Course in Congruence'. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For meditations: letters meditation, Sefirot chakra meditation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- For those who didn't attend the first gathering: we covered quite a volume of information about major kabbalistic concepts, history and ideas. I schedule a 'make-up' meeting; attaining the basics may be helpful in further classes --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duration: 2 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Miriam </member_name><member_id>7891623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263427861000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Kabbalah-and-Meditation</urlname><id>1557684</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>Kabbalah and Meditation</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261876959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ramchal: The System of Providence.
