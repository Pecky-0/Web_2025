&lt;p&gt;I have Biked the Beach Section several times, you will enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over those who signed-up on my other Meet-Up Site,  I see a few Faster Riders &amp;amp; Quite a few who ride at my pace. ( 13-14 mph).   There are some who I have never rode with, so I do not know where you fit in.  FYI: This is not a beginners ride.  You are more than welcome to ride, but if you can not keep-up with me, you are on your own. I offer a variety of rides, with different paces.  I am sorry, but I can not accommodate everyone or watch everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Route was marked, but it may be a little faded.  I have done this route twice &amp;amp; I have directions.  Some of you have also ridden  this route &amp;amp; I have a few from another Group, who have ridden this route.  The first 1/3 is basically a straight Route.  Then you go thru Watch Hill &amp;amp; Misquamicut Beaches.  The last 1/3 is heading back to your cars.   If you want directions, please send me an E-Mail &amp;amp; I will send them to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Great Ride &amp;amp; I plan to ride it twice a Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we did this Ride in September.  This is a good Training Ride for those who have Charity Rides coming up in June.  FYI: I plan to do it again in September, God willing &amp;amp; the well don't run dry.  Did your Dad say that ??&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Switch Road is in Richmond, R.I.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave N.</member_name><member_id>10478672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369098111000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1368215153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Back Roads &amp; Beaches of Southern R.I. a Perfect Training Ride</name><id>118778922</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368973800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/118778922/</event_url></item>
