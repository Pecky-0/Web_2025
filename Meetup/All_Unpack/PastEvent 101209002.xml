&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchid Facts and Triva:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Originating about some 80 million years ago, orchids are a fascinating group. The name is derived from the Greek &lt;em&gt;orchis&lt;/em&gt;, which means testicle, so named because of the shape of their bulbous roots. There are about 25,000 different types of orchids, and it's estimated that another 5,000 have yet to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've eaten orchids (as Vanilla), they have inspired books (The Orchid Thief) and movies (Adaptation, based on the book), and were illegal for English women to own for a time because they were considered too sensual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest orchids can grow to 60 feet, weight 2,000 pounds, and produce 10,000 flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, note that I cannot attend due to a previous engagement. If someone would be good enough to step up to organize this even, we'd all be much obliged.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Gather before 8AM in the hallway outside the orchid display room.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1360425695000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Photography Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastPhotographers</urlname><id>1528260</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast Photographers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359055919000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Orchids - The Sexiest Flower</name><id>101209002</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1360414800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastPhotographers/events/101209002/</event_url></item>
