Save your appetite for this delicious lunch!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your Group Organizer is a huge fan of this restaurant and has been looking forward to bringing the Group here almost since the Group's inception.  Your food is cooked right in front of you and it is entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++Prices range from $3-$8 for appetizers and $10-$15 for entrees.  Our entire party must be present to order and eat.  Due to the set-up of the tables you will generally be socializing with those seated in your immediate proximity (up to 2, possibly 3, seats away).  Therefore, we encourage you to arrive on time or a few minutes early to have the opportunity to socialize and mingle.  We will do our usual round of introductions once everyone's drink order has been placed.  We do have the private function room for our Group so socializing should be fairly easy before and after our food is prepared and enjoyed.+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carpool:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;This has been cancelled due to a lack of interest.  We will meet everyone at the restaurant.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fun &amp;amp; Entertaining Japanese Lunch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, February 6th, 2010 @ 1:00pm&lt;br /&gt;Hibachi Steakhouse&lt;br /&gt;315 Morse Street&lt;br /&gt;(Off Route 1 South)&lt;br /&gt;Norwood, MA 02062&lt;br /&gt;781-278-8977&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hibachistkhouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hibachistkhouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hibachistk...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Organizers:&lt;/b&gt; Angela &amp;amp; Mike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Fee:&lt;/b&gt; Organizer Team &amp;amp; Annual Members: FREE, Group Members $2pp, Guests $2pp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Min/Max:&lt;/b&gt;  Max of 30 attendees.

Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over three years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: We will only cancel if there is a snowstorm the day of the event.  TBD - Please see our Weather policy on the About page (scroll to the bottom and click on &amp;quot;weather&amp;quot;).  We will be there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Carpool @ Braintree Town Hall:&lt;/b&gt;  Click &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/messages/boards/thread/8471078"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Hibachi Steakhouse:&lt;/b&gt; Take &lt;b&gt;Route 95/128&lt;/b&gt; North to &lt;b&gt;Exit 15B (Route 1 South)&lt;/b&gt; toward Norwood.

A prominent landmark is the &lt;b&gt;Boch auto dealership&lt;/b&gt; on your &lt;b&gt;left&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find yourself passing the &lt;b&gt;Norwood Stop &amp;amp; Shop&lt;/b&gt; on your right, you have gone about &lt;b&gt;1/2 mile too far&lt;/b&gt; and need to turn around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please use maps.google.com or mapquest.com for door-to-door directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the Lobby area.
