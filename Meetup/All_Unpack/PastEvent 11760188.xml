Enjoy the crisp air as we walk and chat. You'll find that time goes by quickly. Since Wollaston is so well lit, we will be fine walking in the dark. Plan on walking 1-1.5 hours depending on the group consensus. Hopefully the weather will work out and we'll have a great night!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to dress in layers as it can be windy and cool along the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about this event, please contact me.

Look for the organizers there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will meet by the flagpole</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>4336960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257554938000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257085513000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Evening walk at the beach</name><id>11760188</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257379200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/11760188/</event_url></item>
