You can really bring anything to trade: &amp;nbsp;handmade items, tools, books, plants, seedlings, seeds, preserved or fresh produce, etc. are all welcome at Portland Trading Post. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use the comments area of this page to chat in advance about what you might be bringing and/or looking for from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;nbsp;If you are a member of Hour Exchange Portland (&lt;a href="http://www.hourexchangeportland.org/howtojoin.php"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;join here if you're no&lt;span&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;) consider bringing more substantial items to trade to time dollar hours! &amp;nbsp;I'll make some "I'll Trade for Time Dollars" table tents for anyone who wants to post one on her/his trading table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea is that we are stepping outside of the cash economy and mutually "gifting" things to each other in a way that turns whatever we have in abundance into a diversity of goodness and good will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only rules are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No cash changes hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't start the swapping until everyone's there and has a chance to look around at what's on offer (usually about 15 minutes into the swap, but it's flexible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can swap with someone or simply "gift" things to each other without taking a return item. Your choice. &amp;nbsp;Make sure you've found a home for all your stuff before you leave (or take home what hasn't been gifted).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you bring a food item with multiple ingredients, pls label.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use the comments area of this page to talk about what you might be bringing or seeking. Food/Snacks/Fiddles/Juggling/Attended Children welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very relaxed, social atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;Even if you have nothing to trade, feel free to come by just to see what it's all about and meet some members. &amp;nbsp;We are considering combining these with short skill-shares or "show and tell" sessions, too. &amp;nbsp;These are kid-friendly events but in a "keep an eye on your child" sort of way, as the space is also a functioning business with equipment, etc. Join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that gifting and bartering is still something many of us are getting a handle on...it requires different thinking for our society which has been so used to "monetizing" every transaction or product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the &lt;a href="http://www.urbanfarmfermentory.com/"&gt;Urban Farm Fermentory&lt;/a&gt; for hosting. &amp;nbsp;Consider purchasing some of their fine products while you're at the Trading Post in show of support.&lt;/p&gt;
