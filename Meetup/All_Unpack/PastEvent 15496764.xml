Eight years later, we are still figuring out how to incorporate Personalized Medicine into standard clinical care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2011 Mass Bio Annual Meeting will focus on Personalized Medicine - past, present and future. Leading experts will discuss successes and failures, road blocks, business models, regulatory issues and other challenges around Personalized Medicine, while also offering ideas for solutions and best practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also hear from the patients and advocacy groups - key stakeholders in developing a new model for healthcare that is proactive and preventative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for more details!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponsorship opportunities are available!
