The first Bentara opened in 1980 in Kelantan, Malaysia and it is still in operation with the chef's mother at the helm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blending of all different ethnicity and influences from Indian and Chinese cultures as well as Dutch, Portuguese and English produces a unique mixture of dishes in the Malaysian dining experience. One dish that has been associated with Malaysia is Satay; skewered meat grilled over charcoal and served with a stewed peanut in coconut sauce and spices. This is accompanied with sliced cucumbers, red onions and ketupat (compressed rice cakes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentara is Connecticut's finest Malaysian restaurant, with some of the spiciest and most creative dishes in Downtown New Haven. The spacious interior, carved out of a historic storefront in the Ninth Square neighborhood, is dramatic and elegant, combining an architectural eye with fascinating elements of Malaysian culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A parking lot is available at 110 Crown Street. From Orange Street, drive past the restaurant to the next traffic light. Turn right onto Crown. Parking lot in 1 half block on left. Parking is validated on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>the reservation will be in my name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nanette</member_name><member_id>4729277</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1255812161000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254093066000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebration Dinner at Bentara</name><id>11481514</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255214700000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/11481514/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
