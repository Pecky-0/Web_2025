Who will take you there? Everywhere you turn, you hear the “soul” mentioned; people looking for their “soul mates” and trying to discover who they are as souls. All the while, the nature and location of the soul remain unknown to so many; but not to all. At this seminar, Father Peter will awaken within you the truth about the soul, which will leave you with a clear understanding that will springboard you into a real search that will lead to discovery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/a/centersoflight.org/boston/" target="_blank"&gt;http://sites.google.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245541326000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242278445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  Soul Searching</name><id>10409189</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245367800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/10409189/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/4/global_4477444.jpeg</photo_url></item>
