&lt;p&gt;Start your St. Patricks Day celebration off with a traditional Irish Breakfast at Harrington's Irish Pub on Sunday, March 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's opens at 9:00am. We will meet there at 9:15am to avoid any lines, be seated at 9:30am and have the big breakfast that will get us ready to celebrate and drink all of St. Patricks Day. &lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/b/7/0/event_104539312.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is NO COVER for Breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives are going Green on Sunday, March 17 to celebrate St Patrick's Day at Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield. Harrington's is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's is all Irish, all day, all night, on both floors. There is live entertainment all afternoon and night at Harrington's led by the owner Dan's band Casterbridge Union and Terry Weir and others. There is a $10.00 cover after 1 pm. (We have another group attending in the afternoon through the evening).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center. And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station via the Reading and Haverhill Trains stopping at Wakefield with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion to Main to Water Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to pay in cash as you order or maintain your own bar tab and settle with your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
