&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/span&gt; by Margaret Atwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"In a startling departure from her previous novels ( Lady Oracle , Surfacing ), respected Canadian poet and novelist Atwood presents here a fable of the near future. In the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, far-right Schlafly/Falwell-type ideals have been carried to extremes in the monotheocratic government. The resulting society is a feminist's nightmare: women are strictly controlled, unable to have jobs or money and assigned to various classes: the chaste, childless Wives; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the "morally fit" Wives. The tale is told by Offred (read: "of Fred"), a Handmaid who recalls the past and tells how the chilling society came to be. This powerful, memorable novel is highly recommended for most libraries."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the book and that I'll see you all in September!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachel Greene</member_name><member_id>11862196</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316984738000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1313546639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Brookline Book Club</name><id>29786701</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316980800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/29786701/</event_url></item>
