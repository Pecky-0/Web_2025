&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- the river and its banks, tidal creeks, salt and fresh water&amp;nbsp;wetlands,&amp;nbsp;grasslands,&amp;nbsp;woodlands, and former agricultural fields. The land is being actively managed to provide habitat for many animals including waterfowl and New England cottontails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time/Distance&lt;/strong&gt;: We'll be out for about 3 hours, hiking on level, sometimes muddy ground. If there's snow on the ground, this is a great place to snowshoe! Food &amp;amp; drinks afterward, probably at The Farm Bar &amp;amp; Grille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;: From Dover or from Route 4, take Back River Road to Rabbit Road. Turn right at end of Rabbit onto (Old) Garrison Road then left at the sign to the gate. (A portion of Back River Rd is called Piscataqua Rd on some maps.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trails&lt;/strong&gt; on the 400-acre urban oasis are widely used by birders -particularly those seeking grassland species -- and other wildlife-watchers, hikers and cross-country skiers. Hunting and trapping are permitted.The Bellamy has been managed for wildlife since the early 1990s, after being acquired through the New Hampshire Land Conservation Investment Program (LCIP). Surrounded by urban communities, Bellamy is valued by its human neighbors for hunting, fishing and other outdoor opportunities -- and as a natural refuge for all kinds of wildlife.

It's a major feeding and resting area for these and other migrating waterfowl, plus estuarine and shorebird species such as sandpipers, herons, gulls, and osprey. Other wildlife include deer, pheasant, upland game, bobolinks, and meadowlarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A project is underway to re-establish native grasslands at Bellamy River WMA. A commercial timber sale/habitat improvement project was recently completed to create patches and strip cuts to regenerate oak, provide woody browse and increase structural habitat diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winter Hiking&lt;/strong&gt;: This time of year it's a good idea to carry&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;microspikes&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and/or hiking poles because trails can be wet or icy even if there's no snow on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
