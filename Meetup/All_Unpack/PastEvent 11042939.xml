The next easy water source is when we hit the Wilderness Trail at @ mile 15, but will need to be filtered or otherwise made safe to drink.  Water is available at the Guyot shelter, but adds distance and elevation to the hike. We recommend  3 - 4 liters per person. This is a hike to pack very light - 19 miles is a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to carry a headlamp just in case, and bring enough food to last you the day. Don't forget your camera!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend who is hiking Liberty &amp;amp; Flume will be waiting with a cooler of cold drinks and will give us a ride back to the start, so we will not need to do a car spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact us directly with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob &amp; Geri</member_name><member_id>4842806</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249901467000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249495370000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Zealand-Bonds Traverse - ADVANCED Day Hike</name><id>11042939</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249728300000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11042939/</event_url></item>
