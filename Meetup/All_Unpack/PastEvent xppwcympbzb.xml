Here are the details of the November meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight’s topic: Be the Casting Director of Your Own Life – Choose the roles you want to play&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there some roles in life that you wish you could play, but you just don’t feel confident enough to step into?  Perhaps you’d love to answer the call to be a hero, a successful entrepreneur, a passionate lover, or a calm centered person; but you just don’t believe it’s possible for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are probably roles which you feel fit you perfectly.  Perhaps you’re confident that “I’m a kind person,” “I’m intelligent,” “I’m a go-getter,” “I’m unlucky,”  “I’m a poor student,” or “I’m unlovable.”  You’d be comfortable in these roles.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In NLP we call these self-concepts, and they are among the most powerful of all avenues for personal change.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this month’s meetup, I will teach you how to explore the structure of your self-concepts.  We will then do exercises to tune-up your positive self-concepts to make them even stronger, and begin to transform your less useful self-concepts; so that you can cast yourself in any role you want to play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular.  I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to discuss specific issues that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Marx &lt;br /&gt;NLP Master Practitioner &lt;br /&gt;New Light NLP &lt;br /&gt;317 N Main St, Natick MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;(617) 329-1657&lt;br /&gt;adam@NewLightNLP.com &lt;br /&gt;www.NewLightNLP.com &lt;br /&gt;Helping you to become the you that you want to be: &lt;br /&gt;Coaching, Counseling, and Training&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go straight back to the large studio</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259008285000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256775587000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston NLP November Meetup- Be the Casting Director of Your Own Life</name><id>xppwcympbzb</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258676100000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/11737072/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/f/global_11743071.jpeg</photo_url></item>
