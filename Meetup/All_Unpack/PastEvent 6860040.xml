This will be an opportunity to meet other local sailors, find sailing opportunities around Cape Cod Bay, and find some sailing gear. What more could you ask for in the dead of winter? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in room #156, which is upstairs. We are working on having a few people come to describe sailing opportunities in the area, such as sailing clubs, sailing schools, yacht clubs, etc. We'll start the talks at 6:30pm. There will be time beforehand to just meet the other Meetup members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have quite a few local organizations speaking:&lt;br /&gt;SailTime Boston&lt;br /&gt;Courageous Sailing Center&lt;br /&gt;Constitution Yacht Club&lt;br /&gt;Mass Bay Sailors&lt;br /&gt;Winthrop Yacht Club&lt;br /&gt;BoatWise&lt;br /&gt;Boston Harbor Island Alliance&lt;br /&gt;TowBoat U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, you can walk the show.
