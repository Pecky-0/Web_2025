Join Susan Gale to learn how to create your own and how to make use of this amazing healing oil.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your own cotton flannel and a towel, and you can create your own pack for immediate use!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for great food and conversation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, many come to the potlucks other than Meetup members, so do not look at the RSVP's to determine if it will be a well attended event!  We do hope you will come and join other like-minded folks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542168000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189897908000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Indigo Children and Parents October Meetup</name><id>6366308</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192917600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/6366308/</event_url></item>
