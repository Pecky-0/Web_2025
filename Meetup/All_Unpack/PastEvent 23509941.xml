In this Meetup we will feature two professional psychics to answer questions about your own experiences and practices.&amp;nbsp; Our experts will teach us about the different kinds of ESP, such as mediumship versus psychic intuition, and the different ways to get information (the four clairs: clairaudience, clairvoyance, clairsentience, claircognizance). You'll get tips for how to distinguish types of paranormal dreams and what to do with them, as well as advice for building your psychic abilities. Join us with your questions or comments on visions, clairvoyance, remote viewing, out of body experiences, premonitions, psychic healing, telepathy, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
