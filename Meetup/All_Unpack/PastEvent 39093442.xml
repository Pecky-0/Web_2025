&lt;p&gt;Be sure to join us at the Middeboro Christmas Parade on Saturday, 11/26 (raindate, Sunday, 11/27) at 1:00. We'll gather at the Henry B Burkland School, 41 Mayflower Ave, Middleboro, MA starting at 12:00 so that we can get organized properly. The Pugs should be dressed in Christmas coats, sweaters, or collars (antlers optional), and I'd like to see each Pug decorated with at least one non-breakable Christmas ornament, plus some jingle bells. Everyone bring jingle bells - nothing more fun than a pack of musical Christmas Pugs! Whoever has a wagon, please bring it! It's always nice to have extra wagons for the old, slow Pugs. Don't forget to decorate your wagon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if your Pug would prefer not to dress up, come anyway!&amp;nbsp; Everyone looks forward to seeing the Pugs marching in the Christmas parade.&amp;nbsp; This is our third year participating in this wonderful tradition.&amp;nbsp; We hope to see all of our Puggie friends and their people there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>shar</member_name><member_id>2833949</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322536224000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319833435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pugs March at the Middleboro Christmas Parade!</name><id>39093442</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322326800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/39093442/</event_url></item>
