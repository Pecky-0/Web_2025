Located at 335 Harvard Street, Zaftigs is my favorite restaurant in Brookline.  The best part is that they have the same menu all day, so you can have anything from an omelette to fish to steak for for dinner.  Sign up quickly, as this event will likely fill up fairly quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eli &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following MEMBER GUIDELINES were developed so our events run smoothly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our focus is on friendly and respectful gatherings while sharing a delicious meal. &lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly. &lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend. &lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the event and you have not attended the event, it is counted as a NO-SHOW. &lt;br /&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO after 7pm Wednesday August 29th, it is counted as a NO-SHOW. &lt;br /&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW it will count as if you've NO-SHOWED. &lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events you are removed from the group. &lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation. &lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the event and you are not able to attend or are running late, you must text or call Tonya at (617) 445-7549.&lt;br /&gt;An email from you explaining your absence or less than twenty-four hour change, is an expected courtesy. &lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment requesting to be placed on wait list. &lt;br /&gt;If this event is full and you wish to attend, please RSVP NO with a comment to be wait listed. &lt;br /&gt;Your feedback is appreciated, so please rate the event and venue by completing the surveys after the events.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189719258000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187319629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Breakfast for dinner, part II</name><id>6195192</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188514800000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/6195192/</event_url></item>
