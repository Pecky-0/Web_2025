Check out their website at &lt;a href="http://www.bergamotrestaurant.com"&gt;www.bergamotrestaurant.com&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a very easy place to over-indulge both your appetite and your pocketbook. But this is January, the month where everyone is recovering from holiday excesses. So let's sample Bergamot's pleasures in a more affordable way. On week nights before 7 p.m., they offer a 3 course prix fix dinner for $39 . . . at this time of year, that is SO much more my style!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, your reservation fee will be added in to the tax and tip, which I'll figure for the table. So it is not really a fee. But it IS an excellent way to ensure that people are serious about coming. And in this case, since I have a potential cancellation fee on my credit card for the reservation, I need you to be serious about coming! Note the cutoff date for RSVPs, which is a bit earlier than our usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation in Iris's name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330735711000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325531976000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Early bird prix fixe dinner at Bergamot</name><id>46296822</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326927600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/46296822/</event_url></item>
