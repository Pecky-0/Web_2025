The “retro soul” tag is added to almost any contemporary work that sounds like it was originally recorded before 1980, and Mayer Hawthorne is aware of how trends come and go. Hawthorne is not interested in taking it back to the “good old days,” as much as he is in creating the “new good days” and he proves that he is not part of a trend. The classic Motown sound that provided the blueprint for his self-produced independent debut, A Strange Arrangement, remains, but is joined on his latest release, How Do You Do, by music reminiscent of late 1960s California pop and the best workfrom the likes of Steely Dan and Chicago.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
