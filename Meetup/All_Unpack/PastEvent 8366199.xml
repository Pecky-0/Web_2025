You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder.  For more information see: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/everett.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Metro nearly kicks us out @ 10 pm we go wine, whine and dine not too far from Everett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you there! &lt;br /&gt;Lopa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black pants and a green/red/blue shirt.  I will wait till 7:15 pm and if you arrive after that you'll have to come find me. :) I will have a description of what I'm wearing on the whiteboard near the restrooms.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Opal</member_name><member_id>3394775</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217804540000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>It's fun!
