In addition, multi-pure filtered water is used during all food preparation stages, including rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome your special dietary requests and will be happy to accommodate them. We encourage you to share your appetite with us and are confident you will enjoy your wholesome dining experience as much as we enjoy creating it for you.
