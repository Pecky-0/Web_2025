A quick loop around the Broad Street Green onto Broad Street turns right onto Marsh Street and left onto Hart Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Hart Street take a right onto Main Street and enter the Wethersfield Cove. The finish is on the path from the cove to the Solomon Welles House.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The course is accurately measured but not certified. The run is scenic and flat on good road pavement (except for a 100 yard section of grass by the cove). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Course Map:  Old Wethersfield 5K  (pending)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information on 10K course is pending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions &lt;br /&gt;Take I-91 to Exit 26 (Old Wethersfield). &lt;br /&gt;Follow signs to Department of Motor Vehicles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking &lt;br /&gt;Park in Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) parking lot &lt;br /&gt;at 60 State Street, Wethersfield.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abdul</member_name><member_id>2464273</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256247512000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>5K-Runners-Meetup</urlname><id>1354697</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>5K Runners Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245867880000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>5K Road Race and 5K Family Walk</name><id>10726643</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251633600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/5K-Runners-Meetup/events/10726643/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/b/global_9326235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
