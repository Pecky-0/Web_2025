Isn’t it romantic? The city is (hopefully) covered with a blanket of snow, the ice skating rinks are open, and Xmas lights twinkle everywhere to add to the festive mood. I didn’t appreciate the season in NYC until I moved across the country – isn’t that always the way? – but now I look back with fond memories at the wonderful activities and things to see and do in New York City during the Christmas holidays. Here, in no particular order, are the top 10 things to do in the city for the winter holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;Ideas&lt;br /&gt;1. Every day after Thanksgiving and up until Christmas, Santa Claus is at Macy’s in Herald Square. Anyone who’s seen that old movie, Miracle on 34th Street knows that Santa indeed lives at Macy’s. The lines may be long, but he’s considered the best Santa in NYC.&lt;br /&gt;2. Stroll around 5th Avenue, and admire the famous, elaborately designed window displays. Department stores like Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord &amp;amp; Taylor, Macy’s, Barneys, and Bloomingdale’s participate in this visual fun.&lt;br /&gt;3. Everyone can afford tickets to see Balanchine’s The Nutcracker. It’s performed by the New York City Ballet at Lincoln Center, and tickets range from a mere $10 to a splurge-worthy $215. This show is only around during the Xmas holiday season, and is iconic of Christmas in the city. Cute little children scurry and dance, the toy soldiers march, and a huge one-ton Christmas tree make for a wonderful show.&lt;br /&gt;4. While we’re on the topic of traditional winter holiday shows in New York, the world famous Radio City Rockettes have been performing their Radio City Christmas Spectacular for over 75 years (with different actual Rockettes, needless to say). This year, The Rockettes kick in unison until December 30, and tickets range from $40 to $250. Anyone visiting NYC in the winter should consider trying to budget in seeing Christmas Spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;5. The Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle has its annual “Under the Stars” light show, and (fake) snow falling in its entranceway. This show and experience is every weekend evening until January 2; good thing, too, since there isn’t always real snow in NYC for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;6. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is the biggest in the city, and the annual tree lighting is nationally broadcast. The lighting is always at the beginning of December – this year it’s December 3 – and it stays lit through the first week of January.&lt;br /&gt;7. The ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center is cheap (skate rentals are less than $20)&lt;br /&gt;8. A romantic Horse Drawn Carriage Ride thru Central Park, maybe in the snow!!! How Romantic would this be?&lt;br /&gt;9. A what ever day. You pick and choose how much you want to do. Great food/people watching/ getting into the Holiday Spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Large Bus with Singles having a blast</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ira Wettenstein</member_name><member_id>5032313</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292077642000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>56</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284075785000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Ira- New York City/Big Apple Holiday Bus Trip </name><id>14717215</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292072400000</time><rsvp_limit>56</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/14717215/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/c/global_11330492.jpeg</photo_url></item>
