We can head up to the Center of Advanced Visual Studies at 6:15 pm to find seats. The Center is right next to the MIT Museum. You go through the door to the right of the MIT Museum, go in the elevator and head to the third floor. Don't take the stairs, you won't be able to get in that way. There should be a sign pointing the way. And, yes, it is free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-T.J. Maher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the site:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/events/2009/10/27/alumna-kelly-dobson-cavs" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.media.mit....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kelly Dobson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Artist Lecture&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuesday, October 27, 6:30 PM - 7:30 pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Kelly Dobson is an artist and engineer who works in the realms of technology, medicine, art, and culture. Her projects involve the parapraxis of machine design -- what machines do and mean for people other than the purposes for which they were consciously designed. She is currently working with machines that call into question our shiftable notions of being and care. Currently a Visiting Artist and Assistant Professor in Digital+Media at RISD, she is a Research Affiliate at the CAVS, and received a SMVisS from the MIT Visual Arts Program and a PhD from the Media Lab&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will meet outside the MIT Museum at 6:00 pm. We can go try to find seats as a group at 6:15 pm. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; namegag and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Kelly Dobson's site&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~monster/" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.media.mit....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Long before implants, splicing, and cyborgs, people and machines co-evolved as companion species. Critical infoldings happen in the connections between people and machines, and my work in Machine Therapy investigates these engagements. The machines (some made by me, some found) have expressive engaging behaviors, strength of character, negotiative egos and neurotic propensities...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... on her site she talks about past projects such as Wearable Body Organs, and Machine Therapy. For an exampel of wearable body organs there are items such as ScreamBody &amp;quot;is a portable space for screaming. When a user needs to scream but is in anynumber of situations where it is just not permitted, ScreamBody silences the user’s screams so they may feel free to vocalize without fear of environmental retaliation, and at the same time records the scream for later release where, when, and how the user chooses&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Blendie (past project):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~monster/blendie/" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.media.mit....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Blendie is an interactive, sensitive, intelligent, voice controlled blender with a mind of its own. Materials are a 1950’s Osterizer blender altered with custom made hardware and software for sound analysis and motor control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;People induce the blender to spin by sounding the sounds of its motor in action. A person may growl low pitch blender-like sounds to get it to spin slow (Blendie pitch and power matches the person) and the person can growl blender-style at higher pitches to speed up Blendie. The experience for the participant is to speak the language of the machine and thus to more deeply understand and connect with the machine. The action may also bring about personal revelations in the participant. The participant empathizes with Blendie and in this new approach to a domestic appliance, a conscious and personally meaningful relationship is facilitated&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Wearable Body Organs (past project)&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~monster/screambody/" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.media.mit....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Wearable Body Organs is a series of very visible, spectacular or carnival even, play-use objects-devices-equipments that both offer context sensitive functionality for their wearer and simultaneously announce their own need for existence by being used in public without being hidden and small as is the trend with consumer gadgets and self-helping devices, hearing aids, PDAs,artificial organs, and colostomy bags. ScreamBody, CryBody, SleepBody, EatBody, HoldBody, FightBody, HideBody, HouseBody... Rather than being hidden and made to go unnoticed, these &amp;quot;products&amp;quot; are designed to be noticed, as this is key in their functionality -- they are social-critical activists&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Center for Advanced Visual Studies&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Advanced_Visual_Studies" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT was founded in 1967 by artist and teacher Gyorgy Kepes. Kepes, who taught at the new Bauhaus in Chicago, originally founded the Center as a way to encourage artistic collaboration on a large civic scale.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
