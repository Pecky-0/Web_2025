We can order appetizers as a group or If you'd like, you can order dinner as well. Or if you just want to come and have a drink that's fine too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving this some thought coupled with some of your responses, we felt it best to keep the option open to whatever you were comfotable with.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have not collect any money to this point, please refrain from doing so.  I only ask that you RSVP by tommorow night August 14th. We need at the very least a head count so that we can be accomodated comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank Italia DeFazio for helping me pull this event together. So when we meet on August 16th, be sure to thank her for helping me organize this. How appropriate to have someone named &amp;quot;Italia&amp;quot; help setup our first MeetUp. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on Francesco's Ristorante, visit their website at ristorantefrancescos.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorenzo</member_name><member_id>4408109</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187478253000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Amici Italiani</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-452</urlname><id>535327</id><group_lat>41.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>Connecticut's Viva Italia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185931850000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"VIVA ITALIA" MeetUP UPDATE (please read!)</name><id>6106571</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187305200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-452/events/6106571/</event_url></item>
