At 7:00 we will commandeer one of the seating areas and start our discussion / exchange, but there will be no dinner at this event. The social continues until 8:00, so there will be more free hors d'oeuvres, but you will have to buy a drink after 7:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to reserve directly as they only admit by prior reservation (it's a club).&lt;br /&gt;RSVP by Friday March 26 to Nikki DiGuilio at 617.960.8376 or nikkidiguilio@livenation.com.&lt;br /&gt;Say you are a guest of Thurman Smith (but don't mention the meetup group).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our main topic is to swap information on Mass. races in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thurman Smith&lt;br /&gt;781-388-9386&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I won't arrive until abouit 6:30; I look like my picture!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>THURMAN SMITH</member_name><member_id>1416920</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277167339000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Conservatives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>townhall-61</urlname><id>155655</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Conservatives' Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276623812000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthy gathering</name><id>13809036</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277161200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/townhall-61/events/13809036/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/1/9/global_3409561.jpeg</photo_url></item>
