&lt;p&gt;In this year's Speaker Series, successful entrepreneurs will talk about the paths they took on their way to starting, running, and growing their businesses. They will talk about the lessons they learned along the way and the things they wished they had known when they started out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Bogoff partnered with Chris Lalli in 1992 to create Berkshire Brewing Company (BBC). Based in historic South Deerfield, MA, BBC was on the leading edge of the national microbrewery movement that continues today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From humble beginnings in a renovated cigar factory, BBC has grown to become one of the largest microbreweries in New England. The company's goal is to produce clean, fresh, well-balanced ales and lagers in small batches. Currently, it has the capacity of producing 580 barrels (17,980 gallons) of fresh beer each week. Today, BBC brews nine year-round flavors of ales as well as seven seasonal lagers with distribution to five states, including its flagship beer BBC Steel Rail Extra Pale Ale. The company brews more than 15,000 barrels of beer a year, equal to 465,000 gallons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Speaker Series events are free and open to students, alumni, the University community, and the general public. Lunch will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
