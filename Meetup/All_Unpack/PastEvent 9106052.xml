We (the collective) were lucky enough to go to a show of hers in November (&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/calendar/6621507/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;) before someone broke into the Marsh Gardens at Yale, where her work was being showcased.  (Two pieces remain missing, but eight were recovered, luckily).  You can see some of her art at www.clinard.org, and you can see a flyer for this particular event at &lt;a href="http://www.clinard.org/exhibitions/index.html"&gt;http://www.clinard.or...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to tour the show whenever you wish, but I'm going over with a few people at 5pm on Friday.  We can meet a the corner of Whitney Avenue and Sachem Street at that time and go over together : ) I'm really looking forward to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dev is your contact; my number is in my RSVP : )&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah</member_name><member_id>3741637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226268346000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225982480000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Opening reception for Sculptor Susan Clinard's work!</name><id>9106052</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226095200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9106052/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/0/global_6215328.jpeg</photo_url></item>
