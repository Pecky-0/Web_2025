We don't have to go around everything together (which could be challenging anyway) but take a look at the program and we can communicate here about what we'd like to check out and maybe groups will form organically. (I have got my eye on Shakespeare and some dance and music...films - so much to choose from!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://firstnight2011.sched.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've booked a table for 10 at Pazzo, 269 Newbury St, Boston - Italian where you can get pizzas and appetizers from $10 - 12 and entrees for $16 - 23 if you want to eat more. Let me know if you prefer NOT to meet for dinner and I'll amend the reservation - and you could maybe turn up at the restaurant later. (More fun to eat together though..)&lt;a href="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/img/6600937677290979606/toolbar/smiley.gif" target="_blank"&gt;http://img2.meetupsta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: If you have signed up, please come. There are now people on the waiting list. If you are unsure, please take yourself off the list so that others can sign up, thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the table for 10 and somebody who looks like me..</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1293900477000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291479482000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and First Night in Boston! </name><id>15640020</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293834600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/15640020/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/global_18876213.jpeg</photo_url></item>
