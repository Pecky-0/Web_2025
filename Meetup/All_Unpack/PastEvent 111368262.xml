Not know how to approach people at networking events?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Join Socializing for Justice for a  &lt;em&gt;fast-paced,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;fun &amp;amp; interactive&lt;/em&gt; Skillshare on the Art of the Schmooze on May 6th, 6:00 - 8:30 PM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoJust hosts events that draw progressives of all stripes that share common values but may work on different issues.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SoJust's Co-Founder, Robbie Samuels, who is well known for his schmoozing skills, is this month's trainer. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art of the Schmooze&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Forming and cultivating relationships is at the heart of any successful fundraising campaign, volunteer drive, committee effort or community building activity. This training will give you the confidence to pursue your personal goals - from the importance of shaking hands and making eye contact, to tips on the best opening line and how to exit a conversation gracefully. An amazing side benefit is that you'll learn how to create a welcoming community space by keeping an eye out for outliers, considering yourself a host instead of a guest and knowing how to compliment someone without "othering" them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABOUT OUR PRESENTER  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Robbie Samuels&lt;/strong&gt; has extensive community organizing, events logistics and fundraising experience. In 2006 he co-founded Socializing for Justice to build a cross-cultural, cross-issue progressive community, network and movement in Boston based on the philosophy of abundance. He is the Senior Manager of Events and Donor Engagement at Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp;amp; Defenders (GLAD). On the side he offers trainings and consultation to non-profit boards, venture capitalists and grassroots organizers. In 2011, Boston City Council named his birthday, September 16, "Robbie Samuels Day". Learn more about his trainings, including: Art of the Schmooze, Fundraising: Getting Past the Fear of Asking, Suicide Prevention Training for Community Leaders, at &lt;a href="http://www.robbiesamuels.com/"&gt;www.robbiesamuels.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Check out his &lt;a href="http://www.robbiesamuels.com/p/testimonials.html"&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt; - including this one: "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Robbie's Art of the Schmooze training totally blew me away. First of all, it must be said-- Robbie is VERY FUNNY. In fact, the workshop felt almost more like a comedy show than a skill-building workshop. It was awesome. Apart from being highly engaging, Robbie was also insightful, informative and wonderfully practical. As someone who often has trouble getting out of dead conversations, I felt like I came out of the workshop with concrete strategies for how to wrap up and end a conversation BEFORE it dies. On the flip side, Robbie also has a number of great stock comments/questions to help keep conversations from prematurely dying. Now, I consider myself an extrovert but it is still extremely helpful to get such a clear explanation of what kinds of questions help deepen connections, and which kinds of questions one should avoid. From handshakes, to body stances, to where to keep your business cards, Robbie knows the ins and outs of how to make connections and keep them. I got so much out of this workshop. I only wish I could sit through it again (and again and again...)." ~Beck Epstein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
