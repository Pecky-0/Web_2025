<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Again, just to try to mix up when we meet, I thought that we could try a Saturday.  November is a bit far away, but the slots have been filling up, and October can be a crazy time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's plan on Saturday, November 3.  Hopefully, people enjoy the idea of doing a potluck.  So, let's say for those who want to eat dinner, come at 7:00 with either a salad or side dish.  Those who just want to get down to the games, plan on coming at 8:00.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address for the house is 21 Lemon St. and it is pumpkin colored.  (There are also two cats who live here, should you have allergies.)  Hopefully, we'll start to get some non-pet households on the schedule for those with allergies.  Anyone please feel free to volunteer to host at some point, just send me an e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your RSVP, please specify if you will be coming at 7:00 or 8:00.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200116565000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189831279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Board Games in November</name><id>6362734</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194130800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/6362734/</event_url></item>
