Make sure you sign up soon – there are a limited number of tickets and lots of interested partygoers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sign up, you need to call the Post Club directly at: 617-332-2582&lt;br /&gt;or you can drop by their offices at 313 Washington Street (3rd floor), Newton (right across the street from the Newton Sheraton) and sign up in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $75.00 for Post Club members / $85 non-members beginning January 15th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: &lt;br /&gt;(1) As a non-Post Club member, if you mention &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Boston Event Guide&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; when you sign up (before Jan. 15th) you can get a $5 discount =&amp;gt; your ticket will cost $70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Several of our Meetup members have attended multiple events at the Newton Sheraton in the past, and it is a great location: Really nice ballroom, excellent food, great service, covered parking garage right next to the hotel, and those &amp;quot;heavenly beds&amp;quot; (if you stay over) are - as they say - really heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The hotel has some special room rate deals for the month of January. If you are prepared to pre-book and pre-pay for your room before Jan. 11th, you can get a rate for as little as $109+tax.&lt;br /&gt;Book &lt;a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton" target="_blank"&gt;online at the Sheraton web-site&lt;/a&gt; or call 1-866-716-8120 and reference rate code TOPDEAL1 for weekend stays.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check the hotel function/event listing for Post Club Holiday Party</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232990406000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Tall Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostontallsingles</urlname><id>1235066</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Tall Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231011393000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Singles Post-Holiday Party (Dinner, Dancing)</name><id>9434859</id><headcount>150</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232757000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostontallsingles/events/9434859/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/5/global_5827173.jpeg</photo_url></item>
