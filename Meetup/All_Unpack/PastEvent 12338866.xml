She has climbed six of the Seven Summits—the highest mountain peaks on every continent—and her goal is to join the ranks of a handful of elite climbers who have scaled all seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only Mt. Everest left, she is well on her way to becoming the first Chinese woman in history to accomplish this feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come chat with this local adventurer and hear her inspirational story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more about Lei at her website: &lt;a href="http://leisventures.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://leisventures.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info go to: BCNC.net &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If possible and you are on facebook go to:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=227936654086&amp;amp;ref=mf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.c...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;to rsvp with BCNC or mail them at info@bcnc.net or call: 617-635-5129.
