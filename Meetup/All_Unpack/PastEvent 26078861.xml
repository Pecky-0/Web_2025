We frequent there often, walk the paths and when adventurous hike the trails. There is a pond and large grassy areas as well as a very welcoming dog friendly environment. We could meet on a sunday and casually walk around while socilaizing or the more daring of us could venture up the mountain. No matter what you choose its a great day out in the sun and fresh air with our best friends...showing off the bully breeds finest! Lets plan a date soon when we can all confirm availability...with summer I know its harder but maybe a nice morning meet about 9am would be ideal&amp;quot;!?&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1315259748000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1310944941000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue hills in Milton, MA...</name><id>26078861</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1314453600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/26078861/</event_url></item>
