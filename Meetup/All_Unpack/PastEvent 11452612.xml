It's a tribute concert you'll never forget.&lt;br /&gt;The Fourth Annual Lunch Around The World Boston Style Fundraiser (All proceeds to benefit The Elton John AIDS Foundation). Gerald Brann and his band, Yellow Brick Road, are the premiere Elton John tribute band! There is no other performer who sounds and looks so much like him, nor any tribute act that provides the experience of being at an Elton John concert the way Brann and his band do.  With an unprecedented nod from the international superstar himself, Brann was granted permission to use Elton John's own orchestral scores to perform with the Augusta Symphony Orchestra.  Brann and Yellow Brick Road have been officially endorsed by Hercules, the International Elton John Fan Club, and have played extensively throughout New England, including The Foxwoods Resort and Casino, to rave reviews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of past snafus with pre-payment and procrastination, I set a short deadline for me to receive payments and buy tix in advance. That deadline has passed but if you still want to come, maybe have dinner with us before the show,  you may still be able to find tix on Bostix.org. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I am asking for  payment of $1 per person per event whether I buy your tix or not to help cover the fee for Meetup organizer. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet beforehand for a drink, maybe dinner - venue TBD</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256164522000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253759214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yellow Brick Road: A Tribute to Elton John</name><id>11452612</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255820400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/11452612/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/6/global_5526982.jpeg</photo_url></item>
