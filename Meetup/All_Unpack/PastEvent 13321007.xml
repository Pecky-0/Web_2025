<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For those organizers who feel that these meet-ups, where we share ideas, advice and touch base, are important to hold regularly, I invite you to join us at UNO Pizzeria on Sunday 16th at 6pm for drinks and/or dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the location and time are not convenient for everyone, but the last meeting at Bertucci's with Biagio convinced me that these meetings are very necessary and productive, so I hope you will try to attend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel that with the ever-increasing number of meet-ups, exploring the possibility of more joint meet-ups for our groups would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.
