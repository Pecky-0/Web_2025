The area is gorgeous, and for several miles of the river the water is crystal clear, you can see the beautiful formations on the bottom and lots of fish!  Plenty of birds everywhere too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be paddling upstream as far as we can go first then back down to the launch area for a break.  That will be about 1 1/2 hours.  For anyone who wants to continue we'll then go downstream awhile then back up, for no more than an additional 1 1/2 hours of paddling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link that shows a map to the boat access area -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/pab/pabpdfs/pab-37.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------Directions------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming from the north, please use yahoo maps or mapquest with Cold Spring Road, Belchertown, MA as your destination, that should get you there.  I also recommend looking at the map in the link above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Mass Pike – (These directions are from yahoo maps, but modified as their directions are misleading in a few places.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Take Exit #8 (Palmer)&lt;br /&gt;- At the end of the offramp after the toll booth, turn left onto Thorndike St.&lt;br /&gt;- In 0.8 miles turn left onto High St.&lt;br /&gt;- High St. becomes Church St.&lt;br /&gt;- Church St. becomes Pleasant St.&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant St. becomes Thorndike St.&lt;br /&gt;- At the end of Thorndike, bear right onto Rt. 181 North.&lt;br /&gt;- Turn left onto Depot Road and then right at the end of that street to stay on 181 North (just follow the signs for 181 North and stay with that).&lt;br /&gt;- In 1.5 miles, turn RIGHT onto Michael Sears Road  (Note that there is a left onto Michael Sears Road about ¼ mile before the right, don’t be confused by this, ignore the one on the left.)&lt;br /&gt;- In 1.3 miles, take a sharp right onto Cold Spring Road&lt;br /&gt;- In about ½ mile, you’ll see a sign that says “Swift River Access” on the right at the entrance to the parking area.  If you go over the river, you missed it.  (The parking area is just after you pass East St. on the left.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1246113069000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241486425000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swift River - Belchertown, MA</name><id>10339157</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244293200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/10339157/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
