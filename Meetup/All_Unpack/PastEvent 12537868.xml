Walk straight ahead and you'll come to some powerlines and then the Musquash Conservation entrance is right there... The hike can be 45 minutes to more than 2 hours, depending on how far the group wants to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find wearing my Stabilicers (like Yax Trax) helpful for the icy patches.... but others did fine with just winter boots...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park at the end of Hickory Hill Drive and heading straight to the trails we can meet under the power lines. I'll be wearing a black bandana with my hair in pony tails.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267287600000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265490201000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Londonderry Musquash Conservation</name><id>12537868</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266681600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/12537868/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/a/global_12965034.jpeg</photo_url></item>
