You can get more information about the Drinking Skeptically Meetup Group at &lt;a href="http://skeptics.meetup.com/183/" class="linkified"&gt;http://skeptics.meetup.com/183/&lt;/a&gt;, and more about the Ig&amp;reg; Nobel Prizes at &lt;a href="http://improbable.com/ig/" class="linkified"&gt;http://improbable.com/ig/&lt;/a&gt;. This is the same webcast you can watch on your computer at home. It should be more fun watching it with a bunch of other people. Well, assuming we placate the wifi gods and can get the webcast to work. "The Ig Nobel Prizes honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think. The prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative -- and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology. In a gala ceremony in Harvard's Sanders Theatre, 1200 splendidly eccentric spectators watch the winners step forward to accept their Prizes. These are physically handed out by genuinely bemused genuine Nobel Laureates." The ceremony starts at 7:30 PM, but the thrilling test pattern is scheduled for 7:05! We will order pizza, consumption of which is optional. It should be delivered at about 7:00 PM. We probably will be watching the event in a room where food is not allowed, so you may want to turn up earlier for the pizza.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be upstairs in the library.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317438349000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315883230000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The IgÂ® Nobel Prizes webcast</name><id>33321292</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317337200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/33321292/</event_url></item>
