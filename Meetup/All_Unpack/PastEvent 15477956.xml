Phoebe O'Connor saw those years in terms of her older sister Faith's life and death. In 1978, 18-year-old Phoebe decides to relive the final months of Faith's life and perhaps discover the truth about her death. She leaves San Francisco for Europe, determined to retrace Faith's journey using the precious postcards from Faith that she has saved for ten years. She visits London, Amsterdam, France, and Germany, where she meets Faith's lover, Wolf. Wolf decides to accompany her to Italy, and they have a passionate, feverish affair as they travel to the place of Faith's death. Phoebe learns the truth about Faith, the sister she has idealized, and about herself and her family. These self-realizations are often painful to read because they are so real. Egan's first novel is great reading. Recommended for most fiction collections.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305874810000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290014867000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Readers: February meet-up:  The Invisible Circus, by Jennifer Egan</name><id>15477956</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298417400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/15477956/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/c/e/global_1450046.jpeg</photo_url></item>
