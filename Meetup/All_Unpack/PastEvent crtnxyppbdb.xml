&lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D Encounters is a weekly Wednesday ongoing in-store campaign, playable in two encounters per week (approximately 1-2 hours per encounter). Players earn experience and treasure for their characters as they participate in a compelling ongoing story arc that lasts for a few months. This season, the Lost Crown of Neverwinter, runs for 14 weeks through November 9. The adventure is divided into four chapters, which are similar to acts in a play. All the Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s (DMs) materials for play are included in the kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest season of D&amp;amp;D Encounters begins on August 10, with an adventure that takes players to the famed city of Neverwinter in the Forgotten Realms, as their characters attempt to locate the Crown of Neverwinter and the so-called Lost Heir before the city plunges into chaos. The Lost Crown of Neverwinter gives players exciting new rules options for their characters as presented in the Neverwinter Campaign Setting, and provides a great way for players new and old to experience this fan-favorite locale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run our Encounters every other week with 2 encounters per night.&amp;nbsp; The night usually lasts 3 hours or so once the tables sit down and start.&amp;nbsp; Players who play in the Game Day will have a special advantage in this season if they successfully completed the Game Day adventure and carry that character over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season also features the newest set of D&amp;amp;D Fortune Cards from the Neverwinter set.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321214089000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1312400451000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D Encounters: Lost Crown of Neverwinter</name><id>crtnxyppbdb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1320271200000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/28207161/</event_url></item>
