Remorse is a feeling inside that comes from recognizing that something you chose really did not feel right to you or to another person.  It is usually accompanied by a feeling of lost time, or lost opportunity to get close to someone you love or to accomplish something that may have been good for you.  This feeling is the fuel that moves you to never choose that action, word or thought again.  Your discomfort can be relieved by asking to be forgiven and by never wanting to taste that bitterness again.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us in learning the true meaning of remorse and repentance and how they work in your daily life to lift your burdens and free your mind.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205969655000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Father Peter Bowes is a Master Teacher and a true inspiration.
