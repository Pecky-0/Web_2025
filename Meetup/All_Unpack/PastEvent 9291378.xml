Trivia rules:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) To be eligible for prizes a teams maximum number players is six. Be aware if a team with less than six players has one of the top three scores, that team would win first or second place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The trivia jockey (TJ) provides Stump! sheets, on which to keep your team score. Write the categories as the TJ reads them, and keep track of the points you've wagered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) When the TJ asks a question, you have one song to write your team name, your answer, and your wager on an answer ticket and hand it in. You can wager 1, 3, 5, or 7 points in the first two quarters, and 2, 4, 6, or 8 points in the last two quarters. You can only use each value ONCE per quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) There are three bonus rounds where you can earn lots of extra points! Your TJ will explain how they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) No shouting out any answers, and absolutely no using cellphones/other devices to look up answers! Teams that break this rule are disqualified.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be seated at the end of the bar furthest from the entrance and should be the only one wearing a Happy New Year tiara.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230070842000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228582032000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>It's Thirsty Thursday, So It's Time For Coogan's Again</name><id>9291378</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229034600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/9291378/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/6/global_6210534.jpeg</photo_url></item>
