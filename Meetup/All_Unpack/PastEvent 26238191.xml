&lt;p&gt;They're called Fast Times, and they&amp;nbsp;rock! They play anything from Blondie to the Ramones, with of course some Def Leppard and Journey.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#65279; 
&lt;a href="http://www.fasttimes.biz/"&gt;www.fasttimes.biz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be there with a bunch of friends, so if anyone wants to come check it out, come by and&amp;nbsp;say hi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band starts pretty promptly at ten, and cover will be $5-10 dollars at that point. If you get there closer to 10:30-11,&amp;nbsp;I've seen cover as&amp;nbsp;high as $15. Also, anyone who knows the Pelham knows it gets very crowded very quickly, so keep that in mind too. The smart bet is to get there closer to 9:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm posting this as a&amp;nbsp;"meet", but this is more like me saying "hey, here's a fun thing to do sat night, I'll be there if anyone wants to come hang out" . Chances are I won't be there till 10, I can never seem to get my friends going in time to get there early. So, I hate to have people waiting on me if I'm late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get there and don't know how to find me, you can text me at (508) 965-0534. Just&amp;nbsp;mention&amp;nbsp;your name in the text, since I don't have many of your numbers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
