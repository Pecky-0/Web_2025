In case you haven't seen them yet, Changes In Latitudes is one of America's premier tribute shows to singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, the master of the tropical lifestyle.  They are a nine-piece band with a singular plan, to take you to Margaritaville.  Every set is a party, with beach balls flying, dancing conga lines, and leis galore.  Oh yes, and the music.  You know more Jimmy Buffett songs than you think you do, and they'll prove it.  &lt;br /&gt;So, if you're ready for a &amp;quot;Latitude Adjustment&amp;quot;, break out your grass skirts and Hawaiian shirts, kick off your shoes, and join the beach party. You can learn more about the band at Changesinlatitudes.biz.&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $15 in advance and can be ordered at IndianRanch.com, or you can buy tickets the day of the event for $20. The show starts at 2:00 so let's plan to meet about noon, get some lunch, and stake out good seats. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277796539000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273354771000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Parrot Head PARTY!!</name><id>13424949</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277568000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/13424949/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/d/d/global_14902061.jpeg</photo_url></item>
