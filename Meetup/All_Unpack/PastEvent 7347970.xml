We do some guided meditation and have some discussion about what the meditation experience is like and how to go deeper in our practice. This is also a great introduction for those who would like to begin a spiritual meditation practice and want to know how to start. We also look at a reading from a sacred text from one of the world religions and talk about what it means for our inner development and how is it relevant to us in our modern lives. It is an evening of warmth and connecting with others who are interested in real conversation and meaningful spiritual experience.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
