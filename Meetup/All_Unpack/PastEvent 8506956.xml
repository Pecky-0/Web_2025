<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We decided at our last meeting to continue with Kant's Prolegomena. The plan is to study the Prolegomena, Critique of Pure Reason, then to go back to Hume for one meeting, to An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals. After these we plan to address Kant's moral philosophy: Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and Critique of Judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this next meeting the text is part of the Prolegomena, up to and including the chapter: The Main Transcendental Question, Second Part. Unlike the usual two weeks, the time before our next meeting is three weeks long this time. Choosing only part of and not the whole Prolegomena was somewhat a &amp;quot;controversial&amp;quot; decision, so anyone who would like to generate a consensus next time to spend only one meeting on the Prolegomena please prepare, do not stop with the reading at the chapter mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a joyful reading!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please ask for the philosophy meetup group from the staff</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220137711000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218241408000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kant: Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics</name><id>8506956</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219964400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/8506956/</event_url></item>
