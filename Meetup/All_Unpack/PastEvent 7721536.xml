It's described as a sweet-natured comedy that offers escapist entertainment. What's not to like about that? The cost includes complimentary hors doeuvres and a drawing before the movie.

I found the directions provided by the link confusing. It's on Rte. 75 in the Southgate Plaza. I'll be in line or in the lobby looking for you.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210091933000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>You'll love it because - don't we all love a good movie once in awhile?</why><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207942601000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Foreign Film Festival</name><id>7721536</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209918600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/7721536/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
