Each class will have two components. The first half of the class will focus on the art of meditation. It will include a guided meditation followed by a practical discussion of how one can learn to deepen their meditative practice. The second half of the class will include a reading from the sacred text of one particular religion and a discussion of the truths put forth there and their practical modern-day application. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
