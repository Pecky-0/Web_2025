&lt;p&gt;What: FOOD, Eating food... relaxing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where: 80 Hope Ave - Longview Apts right next to Children's Hospital in Waltham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: Saturday... at 11 or whenever you show up! -- see most of ya after the St.Jude 5K&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why: Because you're awesome and you're a trail runner :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, June 1, join the Waltham Trail Runners at Longview Apartments (Devon's place). I live close to some of our runs along the Charles River, right near the Children's Hospital on Hope Avenue. Most folks are doing the St. Jude's 5K in the morning, so feel free to come around 11 and hang out for however long. We have a large common area with TV, pool table, fridge, bathrooms, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking we could do it potluck style, so when you sign up, add a comment on what you'd like to bring (BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking?? - Don't worry there's tons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be plenty of parking on the weekend in the parking lot along Hope Avenue, across the street from the garage entrance of the Children's Hospital. It's free! I'm in building 80 and will be downstairs to let folks in (Call me if you get lost... 315-246-1781). Also, there's a fridge downstairs if you need to keep your dish cold. And if you need to heat things up, we can use the stove/oven/microwave in my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special note: If you like WINE, I have tons... name your fave and I'll be sure to chill it/bring it to the shindig. ...courtesy of living near Napa where going through a couple bottles a week was the norm :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devon Messecar</member_name><member_id>48793122</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1370112298000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Waltham-Trail-Runners</urlname><id>1479223</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Waltham Trail Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1368061026000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waltham Trail Runners hang out for a potluck cookout!</name><id>118471502</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1370098800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Waltham-Trail-Runners/events/118471502/</event_url></item>
