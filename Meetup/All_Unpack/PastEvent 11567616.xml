Maria Guleghina plays the ruthless Chinese princess of the title, whose hatred of men is so strong that she has all suitors who can’t solve her riddles beheaded. Marcello Giordani sings Calàf, the unknown prince who eventually wins her love and whose solos include the famous “Nessun dorma.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this isn't the most convenient location for many of you, but this is the only theater that I could find that still had tickets available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;On that note, if you are interested, please purchase your ticket ASAP since these shows sell out quickly&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/themetropolitanopera:turandot_126856/movietimes?tid=AADXG&amp;amp;wssac=58&amp;amp;wssaffid=11551_NationalCineMedia(NCM)&amp;amp;date=11/07/2009" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fandango.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online ticket price $22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please post a comment when you RSVP saying if you have bought your ticket or not.
