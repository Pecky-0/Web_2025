Father Peter will be teaching a seminar each evening that he is here this week. This is a very special event, and we are already anticipating that many group members will be attending all three seminars with this very dynamic and knowledgeable teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final evening: The Mind of Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Einstein once said, "I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details." Do you ever wonder what is in God's mind? What does God think of you and your purpose in this life? The Mind of Christ is accessible to anyone who is willing to still their mind and inquire within their being. Come and learn how to access the wisdom and peace of the Mind of Christ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
