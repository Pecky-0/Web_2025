&lt;p&gt;Please use your rsvp comment to offer or ask for a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions to Ravenswood Park:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Rt. 128 Exit 14, take Rt. 133 East toward Gloucester for 3 mi. until it ends at Rt. 127. Turn right and follow for 2 mi. to entrance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;About Ravenswood Park:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explore a shrouded landscape of hemlock groves, a magnolia swamp, and other trees species where you’ll find remnants of Colonial habitation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravenswood Park offers 600 acres for solitude and quiet contemplation of nature. Whether you prefer to surround yourself with snow-covered hemlocks, experience spring emerging in a burst of color and aroma, or escape the summer’s heat – you’ll find a refuge here. The park is a testament to one man’s conservationist philosophy, and to all those who have cared for this special place. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 With 10 miles of carriage paths and trails that meander through the park, you can find plenty of room to picnic, bird watch, walk, cross-country ski, and simply appreciate the outdoors. Children love the Ledge Hill Trail – a 2-mile round-trip walk among magical-looking, fern-covered boulders. You don’t want to miss trekking to the overlook to Gloucester Harbor or traversing the boardwalk through the Great Magnolia Swamp, home to native sweetbay magnolias (Magnolia virginiana).   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Trails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 10 miles of trails and former carriage roads. Moderate hiking. Carriage roads are covered with dense crushed stone and are generally wheelchair accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
