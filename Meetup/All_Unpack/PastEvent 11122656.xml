It will feature our absolute best models and locations.   And, if thatâ€™s not enough, we will be using some very talented make-up artists and hairdressers to really make this event extra special.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will feature 3 talented, professional models.  &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Glamour-Photography/photos/680345/"&gt;Cassie&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Glamour-Photography/photos/641415/"&gt;Persephanie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will shoot a number of locations including outdoors with reflectors and scrims, indoor, and in the studio.   The event will be from 10AM to 3PM.  This is a longer than normal event to allow time for the professional make-up and hairstyles to do their jobs.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some locations may include a walled garden with dappled sunlight, vintage cars, train tracks (and possible standing freight cars), industrial loading dock and more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be open to only 10 photographers, a 3.3:1 photographer to model ratio.  2 or 3 models will be posing simultaneously so there will be plenty for shooting time and many sets to choose from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Seats will go to the 1st 10 paid attendees. (your RSVP &lt;u&gt;does not&lt;/u&gt; guarantee a seat, only fully payment will guarantee your seat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who attended our Meetups you already know the quality of the models we use and the large professional studio that is available.  If this is going to be your 1st event please take a look at the past reviews to see the consistently high marks our Meetups get.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary,   &lt;br /&gt;-          Paid Professional models, &lt;br /&gt;-                Great locations,   &lt;br /&gt;-                      Full studio,   &lt;br /&gt;-                             Professional hair and makup.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jerry</member_name><member_id>9244453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268609277000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Studio Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Greater-Boston-Studio-Photography</urlname><id>1454286</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2799987793</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Studio &amp; Glamour Photography</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250433666000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of Summer - Best of All Shoot</name><id>11122656</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251640800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Photography/events/11122656/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/b/global_10223547.jpeg</photo_url></item>
