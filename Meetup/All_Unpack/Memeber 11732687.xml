Our 1-2 year old adopted dog is a chihuahua/JRT/daschund mix, who we haven't let off-leash yet, so a well enclosed area would be great.  He wants to play with every little dog!</bio><topics><topics_item><id>10193</id><urlkey>puggle</urlkey><name>Puggles</name></topics_item></topics><name>Deb Desrosiers</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>11732687</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>Holliston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/11732687</link><visited>1271517615000</visited><lon>-71.44</lon></member>
