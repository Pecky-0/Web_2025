Join Boston-area socialists and supporters at the next best thing, an informal get-together at 7 pm on Saturday, 12 July outside Au Bon Pain.  We'll have a chance to get food and drinks, and chat about whatever catches our fancy -- from upcoming antiwar actions to the presidential campaign to music and films.  This should be a relaxed and fun opportunity to meet up and chat, maybe get a drink or something to eat, so stop by and bring your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Au Bon Pain is located at 251 Massachusetts Ave., in between Symphony Hall and the Hynes Convention Center, both of which have stops on the Green Line, and is just down the street from the Mass. Ave. stop on the Orange Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome, nothing is required.
