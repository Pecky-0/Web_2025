However, the path could not be properly maintained, and it fell out of use within approximately 10 years. In 1910, the path was reconstructed for foot travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 3,119 feet, Mount Crawford shares the Bemis Ridge with lesser known peaks Mount Hope and Hart Ledge. Mt .Crawford is the first peak ascended by the historic Davis Path. The trail leading to the summit was constructed as a bridle path, so grades are &amp;quot;easy to moderate&amp;quot; all the way to Mount Washington, approximately 15 miles from the trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hike will take in consideration the early winter conditions and how the group feels after reaching Mt Crawford as to whether we continue on to Mt Stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must adhere to backcountry rules for the Presidential-Dry River Wilderness, which is located within the White Mountain National Forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the same rules as the White Mountain National Forest, plus the following rules specific to the Wilderness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# No motorized equipment or mechanical transport &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# Hiking and camping group size must be limited to 10 people or less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;# No camping, wood or charcoal fires within 200 feet of any trail except at designated campsites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total distance to Mt Stairs and returning to the trailhead:&lt;br /&gt;Distance  9.80 mi&lt;br /&gt;Time  8 hr 0 min&lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain  +3534 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss  -3534 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Change  0 ft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All hikers should review the White Mountain trail map and review the hike plan.
