<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please bear with us as we figure out what type of schedule and format will work best for this group.  We have decided to move it from Sunday to Thursday to avoid interfering with members' weekends.  The group will meet weekly and be fairly informal so you can come whenever you are available.  We will be reading and discussing A Course in Miracles and related material.  You are welcome to bring passages to share that have been meaningful for you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (860) 633-0180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great day, &lt;br /&gt;Theresa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Theresa</member_name><member_id>4688183</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224200822000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Students of ACIM</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>acim-309</urlname><id>1241028</id><group_lat>41.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Connecticut A Course In Miracles Study Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223344003000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Thursday Meetup </name><id>8911931</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223593200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/acim-309/events/8911931/</event_url></item>
