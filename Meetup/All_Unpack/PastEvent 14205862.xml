I am planning a ride  about 6 miles in circle starting at the parking lot near the main entrance at the north end of park along the Union St. (Near Union St crosses Charles St.) and ride toward the camp ground, then go toward Aaron River Reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail map in below website. &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/southeast/womp.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to take the Bridle Path on the west side of the Union St toward Prospect Hill, and return. Once we get to the bottom of the hill, see if we are up to the challenge to ride up the hill (or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried this path yet, and don't think I have a chance to before the event. We will be discovering the path together. I am hoping a small group of us to try this out. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Masahiro&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am on the silver Mt.
