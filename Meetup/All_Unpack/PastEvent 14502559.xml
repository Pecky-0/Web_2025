EZ Acupuncture will be offering this healing service every Wednesday from 3 to 6 pm. Individual sessions will last approximately 30 minutes and can be scheduled in advance by contacting Jeane at mimosa3005@gmail.com.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Description:&lt;/b&gt; Community acupuncture is a return to traditional healing, where treatments were conducted in a group, rather than individual, setting. Group treatments foster a sense of community and support and are convenient for family members or friends to receive treatment together. This also allows us to make acupuncture more affordable and accessible for our patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Acupuntcure:&lt;/b&gt; Acupuncture is a safe, natural holistic therapy that utilizes your bodyâ€™s inherent ability to heal itself. This treatment relieves pain, reduces inflammation, enhances immunity and promotes healing. Additional benefits include relief from headaches, improved sleep, and a deep sense of relaxation. Community acupuncture is performed on zero gravity recliners or yoga mats for your comfort and convenience. Most treatments take about thirty minutes and require no disrobing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost: $30  ($10 off for first time visits)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283977662000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282498699000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community Acupuncture on Wednesdays</name><id>14502559</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283972400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/14502559/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/a/global_11136970.jpeg</photo_url></item>
