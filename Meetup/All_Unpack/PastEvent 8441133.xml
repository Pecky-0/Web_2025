<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I heard that a nice group gathered last week so that's a great reason to schedule more playing this week.  I may or may not show up but most of you recognize each other by now and please be on the lookout for newcomers and make them feel welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the Single Event is playing at Conard on Thursday night at 6 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to believe this weekend is August but we'll have tennis until they take down the nets in the fall (or later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, I can be reached at 860-559-7983 for questions or comments.  Have fun.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217855610000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217431391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis Saturday at Conard</name><id>8441133</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217682000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/8441133/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_2940738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
