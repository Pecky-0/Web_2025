 &lt;br /&gt;

The all-star band 'Dub Apocalypse' and four other highly regarded Boston-area reggae and rhythm bands will perform until late, artisan vendor booths, craft beer, bbq and a full menu to round out the experience. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Every weekend normally brings four bands to The Governor's Inn ¿ acoustic acts perform on the front lawn Thursday and Friday evenings. Rock, jam, and alternative bands normally perform on Saturday nights behind The Garage. And on Sundays afternoons it's the best in blues, bluegrass and Americana. All bands and links are posted at &lt;a href="http://www.governorsinn.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.governorsinn.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

But on Saturday, July 14 it's going to be a whole different act — five of them, actually, including a high-flying experiential 'dub' band named Dub Apocalypse featuring members of John Brown's Body, G Love, Morphine, and The Nate Wilson Group. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Dub Apocalypse has a different and unique sound, with varying cast, at every show and other well known musicians often make it a goal to gig with Dub Apocalypse. Even Nate Wilson (of his band the Nate Wilson Group) sometimes jumps in. This band is ever evolving, but one thing is always constant, and that is amazing music played by an all-star line up that is certainly turning heads with their unique sound. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The other four bands at the Governor's Inn reggae festival deserve nearly as much press but there is only room here to mention their names ¿ Van Gordon Martin, Rythem Inc., The Equalites, and Hot Like Fire. The first band takes stage at 1 p.m., but the festival gates open at noon with open seating, vendor and menus available. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Tickets are $10 for the Reggae Fest and are available in Rochester at Tri-City Bicycles, Jimmy's Convenience Store, Fat Tony's Italian Restaurant, and The Governor's Inn, and in Dover at The Orchard Street Chop Shop Restaurant. Tickets are also available online at &lt;a href="http://www.governorsinn.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.governorsinn.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Others are recommended to bring lawn chairs or lawn blankets. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
