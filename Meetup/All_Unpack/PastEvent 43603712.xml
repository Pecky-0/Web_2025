Wildman of the BU School of theology to deliver a lecture on the different varieties of sophisticated religious naturalism. A welcome opportunity for those who find atheism or secular humanism unconvincing to explore different intellectual options; for secular humanists and atheists, a chance to learn about our co-naturalists of the religious persuasion, whom we must work with to combat shallow literalism and encroaching theocracy. An account of Professor Wildman's research interests and professional achievements can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.bu.edu/sth/academics/faculty/wesley-j-wildman/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bu.edu/sth...&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Wildman is an especially articulate and persuasive speaker whom secular and religious students alike can learn much from.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323389917000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323202188000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Varieties of Religious Naturalism w/ Wesley Wildman</name><id>43603712</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323385200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/43603712/</event_url></item>
