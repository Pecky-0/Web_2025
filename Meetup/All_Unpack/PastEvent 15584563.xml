Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/rpga/downloads/LFR_CharGenGd.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wizards.co...&lt;/a&gt;.  We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something special for this week is that while BALD1-1 will be run at one table, players can vote for which one of the two other modules (CORM1-3 and CORM1-5) will be run at the other table.  Adventure descriptions are below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BALD1-1 &amp;quot;Flames of Initiation&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;You have come to the city of Baldur’s Gate in search of adventure and quickly discover the Flaming Fist, one of the largest and most powerful mercenary companies in all Faerûn. To survive in this teeming metropolis, you must prove both your physical and political prowess, and the challenges you will face might turn out to be far more complicated than you imagined. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Baldur’s Gate for characters levels 1-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORM1-3 &amp;quot;Head Above Water&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;The Valwater family has fallen on hard times but believes that a secret near their family's decaying estates may redeem their good name. Can the PCs uncover the truth that will restore the family's honor? A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Cormyr for characters levels 7-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORM1-5 &amp;quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;There is something rotten in the city of Suzail. While a midwinter festival brings throngs of competitors, merchants, and spectators, it also brings an element of danger. When the host turns to heroes for help, they must uncover what lurks under the city's snow and ice. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Cormyr for characters levels 1-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.  Please have a character pre-made as pre-generated characters will not be available.  Due to issues arising from previous sessions, if you do not come with a pre-made character you will be seated last at a table, as it's unfair to others who RSVP and are ready on time to have to wait and potentially have the adventure not finish in time before the store closes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dale King</member_name><member_id>4528347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291321853000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291054880000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms - "Flames of Initiation" &amp; "Player's Choice"</name><id>15584563</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291244400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/15584563/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
