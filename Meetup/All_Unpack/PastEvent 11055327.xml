ANY EXPERIENCE LEVEL IS WELCOME!! We always have some who have never played before as well as veterans. We will shoot for having a 202 board, but as always we reserve that board for those who have gotten out of the Rat Race at least five times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS TIME, however, we will be doing something SPECIAL to shake it up a bit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is parking on Hemenway Street. Even though it says Fenway Resident, I have never gotten a ticket there. If you have any trouble finding us, please feel free to call my cell (617-519-3163).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE ON TIME!!! We will start PROMPTLY at three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're looking forward to seeing you ALL there on Sunday August 16!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ &lt;br /&gt;617-519-3163&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252266716000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249610374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>REGULAR Cashflow Meetup</name><id>11055327</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250449200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/11055327/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
