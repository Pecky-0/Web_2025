<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;A looping hike of roughly 6 miles and roughly 4.5 hrs. at Hubbard Park in Meriden, CT. We'll stop at Merrimere Resevoir and follow the road to the back, ascend South Mountain to the cliffs, return to the back end of the reservoir, and back to the start. There will be many beautiful views of and on the various cliffs with water views aplenty. Some of the hike will be on a portion of the Metacomet Trail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet at the large parking lot on the east side of Mirror Lake (see map below) and we'll hike from there. Due to the distance and some up/down I would rate this hike high easy to moderate. You must bring a quart of water and trail appropriate shoes. A small backpack would be advised to carry water and maybe a snack so hands are free.&lt;/p&gt;
