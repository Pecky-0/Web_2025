RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT! &lt;br /&gt;

If the weather permits, I think it would be fun to go hiking on the trails at Cutter Woods. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. So come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will meet at 2:00 pm in the parking lot. Because this is conversation land, I can only give you the address of the home that is directly across from the parking lot. The sign is currently off its post and on the ground so please look for the unpaved driveway across from 117 Sherburne Rd. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails. &lt;br /&gt;

If anyone cares to, we can then go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a hot chocolate, at a nearby restaurant. I hope to see you there. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897 &lt;br /&gt;

Location: Across from 117 Sherburne Rd, Pelham NH &lt;br /&gt;
