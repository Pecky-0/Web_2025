If runners wish to connect sign up so other know you will be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I've been reluctant to place unattended runs because a number of people RSVP but never should up so it wasn't fair to someone that traveled to the area expecting to run with a group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend crossing Skiff Street and heading North on the trail.  Though I have never run towards New Haven I have heard from a few sources it goes through some questionable areas and that was confirmed with a newspaper article recently where a few 50 year olds were assaulted because they would not give up their bikes to a gang.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Cummings</member_name><member_id>4930656</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281806349000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenRunners</urlname><id>426798</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280785194000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Morning Run</name><id>14296063</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281787200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenRunners/events/14296063/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/4/8/global_16813352.jpeg</photo_url></item>
