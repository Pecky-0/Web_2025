&amp;ldquo; &lt;span&gt;If you are seeking a spiritual practice that is both practical and profoundly meaningful, regardless of your background (or even your religion!), this class is the place to start.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rdquo; 
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just finished an amazing round of this class. People were deeply moved and definitely felt that their consciousness was raised. Some couldn't get enough and have already started on more advanced classes. If this sounds like something you'd like to experience, I invite you to come, try the practice, meet some wonderful people, and start having a taste of that ever-elusive sense of peace inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are beginning a new six-week class series called Meditation &amp;amp; Mysticism: Experiencing God Within Yourself. This is a powerful introductory course designed for those who are seeking an inner experience of God through meditation. Classes include teachings on the practices of the mystics and how they can be applied in the modern western world. Mysticism refers to "the practice of knowing the reality of God through direct experience." It is certainly nothing new, as it has always been at the core of every religion and represents a more inner, experiential way of coming to know God and the spiritual world. We offer this series as an opportunity for you to discover whether the mystical path might be right for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will be spent teaching the principles of meditation that will allow you to move deeper than the body, beyond thinking and emotions, and into the reality of God's peace and presence within. Each class begins with a guided meditation that will help you begin to learn to&amp;nbsp; meditate or will help you deepen the spiritual dimension of your current practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

This class teaches an introduction to mysticism in the Christian tradition, though the truths are the same as those taught in all mystical traditions. Everyone is welcome, no matter what your previous experience or religious background may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

There is no charge for this introductory class, but RSVP is required. Late admittance may be permissible (after the first week of the class), but check with the organizer to be sure. Completion of this series can lead into more advanced classes for those who are interested. &lt;br /&gt;

The class is offered on six consecutive Tuesday evenings at 7:30pm, beginning January 10, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
