Established in 1949, Cape Ann Camp Site is a family owned and operated business built on the knowledge that the vacation is only as good as its destination &amp;mdash; and you really can&amp;rsquo;t get any better than this small fishing village on the coast of Massachusetts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every site comes with a ready-made fireplace and picnic table. We also have six toilet and shower buildings, and a small campsite store stocked with ice and wood. We now also offer a centrally located Wi-Fi signal and Wi-Fi on big rig spots for Internet connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;We will carpool to keep cost down, arriving Saturday between 10-11:00 am. Set up tent(s) and enjoy some hiking, biking, kyaking and much more. We will be checking out Monday morning, but can still hang around the local Glouster area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;I will be circulating a "what to bring" list, so we can pack as best possible, and still cover all the basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$30.00&amp;nbsp; per car up to 2 people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$8.00 per additional adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each car must register and pay separately.  Example:  2 cars with 4  adults have a base rate of $30.00 for each car and $60.00 total per  night.&lt;/p&gt;
