(ask me about the time i had to jump over a bicycle....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one measure of our pace:  we will be skating fast enough to pass almost any runner you'd see going around the river and we may pass the slower cyclers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we will be going from The Park at the Charles River to the Hatch Shell and back.  according to gmaps-pedometer.com, this is about an 8 mile round trip.  (see the route here: &lt;a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2985619" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.gmap-pedom...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we will stop for traffic and traffic lights as we cross streets and there are a couple of water fountains on the route.  (i usually stop for water.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i'll be at The Park by 5:45p, near the kayak rental stand, and we'll get going at 6:00 sharp.  there's ample parking there and i usually park in lot # 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see you around the river.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>i'll send an email w/my cell # on friday afternoon, 10 july, to all Yes and Maybe RSVPers</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>paul</member_name><member_id>4738108</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249578593000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247068837000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intermediate After Work Skate @ The Park at the Charles River</name><id>10830303</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247263200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/10830303/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/8/global_1713624.jpeg</photo_url></item>
