 We are going out to the western part of the state to&amp;nbsp;Burr Pond State Park. It is a beautiful area of trails in Torrington. We are going around the pond on the Wolcott Trail until we hit the John Muir Trail. From there we are headed out to Walnut Mt. at 1325 ft. It is a good climb but not much of a view.&amp;nbsp; Those who have told me of this peak have never summited. Those who have have never returned. I am kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the summit we will head back (ooh another in and out hike)&amp;nbsp;to the pond and finish the loop. The distance should be about 5 miles with a considerable climb up Walnut Mt. These hikes generally last no more than 4 hours. Dress in layers with no cotton. As we head toward spring you will need waterproof hiking boots for the possible wet conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring water and snacks. We will park at parking area off Burr Mountain Rd., near the north end of the pond.&amp;nbsp; According to the DEP site, there will be a $9 fee to park....sorry.&amp;nbsp; There is a boat launch down the road that can accommodate some cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please no dogs or children. Mapquest link to the parking area:&lt;/p&gt;
