I'll be in lobby at 7:30 &amp;amp; then at 7:45, I and whoever has arrived from our group, will be going into the theatre to take our seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of fun! Don't miss out.&lt;strong&gt; If you're interested, I'd suggest calling the box office to buy your ticket ASAP because I was told that the tickets are selling quickly&lt;/strong&gt; -- particularly with this being a Saturday night performance. (Additional details re tickets/box office below.)&lt;/p&gt;
