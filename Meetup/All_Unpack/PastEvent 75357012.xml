&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;MySQL&lt;/span&gt; is the most popular relational database for web apps – be it Web 2.0 sites, SaaS applications or any other web app.  In most cases, these apps are written in Java and often have lots of users – which translates to a high number of hits/second on their &lt;span&gt;MySQL&lt;/span&gt;instance, and a big database size.  In the meetup we'll dive into this particular area of Java applications - the layer between the application and the database.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will discuss how to optimize the database to better service the increasing the demands from the applications, as well as how to optimize the applications to better handle and exploit database capabilities. A sample of topics that will be covered include: JPA, SQL command optimization, use of database scale-out such as read/write splitting and sharding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
