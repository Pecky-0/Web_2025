&lt;p&gt;Although it takes only two to tango, it takes at least four people to play Proverbial Wisdom (of course, the more the merrier). Teams try to make heads or tails of sketches drawn by the presiding Wisdom Master (every picture tells a story!). They must also identify common sayings drawn on game cards, and choose the meaning of proverbs from three given options. The first team to get all the way around the board and solve the final sketch clue wins. After a few rounds, you and your friends and family will be spouting bits of conventional wisdom and age-old sayings everywhere you go. This great game isn't easy, but as they say... practice makes perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
