&lt;p&gt;A few changes from the past years; They have increased the number of rounds from 4 to 5 and they have also increased the entry fee from $300 to $320.  Perhaps due to the added round, the top 3 from each round qualifies now for the outdoor finals, instead of the top 4 in the past years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 PM Driver Arrival, Check-In &amp;amp; Weigh-In &lt;br /&gt;

 7:00 PM Drivers Meeting and Full Safety Briefing &lt;br /&gt;

 7:30 PM Qualifying Session &lt;br /&gt;

 8:15 PM Official Race Start &lt;br /&gt;

 9:45 PM Official End of Race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format may change at F1 Boston's discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minimum of 5 pit stops have to be completed during the course of the 90 minutes. Pit stop strategies have to be devised by each team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 3 teams from each round will qualify to race in the 3 hour final on Saturday, September 15th at the F1 Outdoor track for a discounted price of $250 per team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost per team for the 90 minute endurance is $320. You can go with a two ($160/driver) or three ($107/driver) driver team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please indicate your interest by RSVP'ing and letting me know if you prefer to be in a two or three driver team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the teams have been made up, you can send me a check when I send in the application to F1 Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer - I will try as much as possible to accommodate all who respond, but please note that due to team configurations as well as availability of grid positions, I cannot guarantee a spot for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
