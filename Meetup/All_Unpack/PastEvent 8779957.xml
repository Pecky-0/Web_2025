I say what better way to organize than a sarge.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, since I fly out for work early as hell Sunday, the only night I can sarge is going to be Friday. And lucky guy that I am this week, I have a meeting at the office in Stamford that night starting at 5. SO... pending my meeting getting out on time and all that fun stuff like traffic, I figure I can get to downtown New Haven at 9:30. FIgure Black Bear is a good spot to meet up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there, we can figure out where we want to sarge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, let me know on here or IM me on AIM -    jcidol@luckymail.com   - Yes, put the entire thing including the @ sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we are gonna get to PUA status, then let's go pick up some women dammit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Any one who can bring a pivot, that'd give us some good exercise too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you can't spot a fellow wingman, there's a problem.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282028868000</updated><rating><average>2.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221701564000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Sarge in New Haven</name><id>8779957</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221874200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/8779957/</event_url></item>
