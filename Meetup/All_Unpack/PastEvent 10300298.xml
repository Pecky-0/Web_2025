Feder is one of our favorite speakers, and we're thrilled that he's returning to speak for us again this year! (If you don't recall or haven't heard of him yet, he's professor of archeology in the anthropology department of Central Connecticut State University.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peking Man: Anatomy of an Unsolved Mystery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tale of the discovery, excavation, and sadly, the disappearance of the Peking Man fossils is one filled with serendipity (both good and bad) intrigue, war, torture, and sex. Well, okay, not sex (that we know of). When discovered and excavated in the 1920s and 1930s, the fossils found in a cave some 40 miles outside of Beijing reflected the most substantial accumulation of human ancestors ever found at a single site, representing more than forty individuals and about a dozen nearly complete crania. Housed for years at the Peking Union Medical College, the specimens fell victim to a combination of stupendously bad luck, tragedy, and human stupidity. All of the precious Peking Man fossils disappeared in the 1940s and none have been seen since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were the fossils destroyed? Probably. Were they irretrievably lost, never to be seen again? Likely. Then again, might they be ensconced in a packing crate in a warehouse in China or a royal palace in Japan? Even more interestingly, are they currently hidden in an attic or basement here in the United States? Maybe you have them. It actually is possible.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243550639000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241061026000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Humanist Association of Connecticut Monthly Meeting - Dr. Ken Feder Returns!</name><id>10300298</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242689400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/10300298/</event_url></item>
