<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a super-informal gathering. I'll be there drinking chai and puttering about on the laptop. I'll be playing with some music software. Feel free to join me and chat about whatever music topic you like. It's purely social. I'll have my headphones, so if you have music to share, bring it...I'd love to hear what you've done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. this is an example of how YOU can post a simple meetup. I don't have to be there. Do one yourself! Post to the mailing list or let me know and I'll post it for you. :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Big, Bald, Beard, Glasses, Laptop. :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luke Stark</member_name><member_id>3565678</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244310355000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Music Makers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>musical</urlname><id>413373</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Music Makers With Relaxed Expectations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242389093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Talking Tech Over Chai (because I don't like coffee.)</name><id>10417864</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243031400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/musical/events/10417864/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/b/f/global_8044031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
