The pimping gangsters in Yokusaka port contrive a plan to raise pigs for the black market, feeding the swine with kitchen scraps from the U.S. Navy. Young Haruko tries to steer her teen hood boyfriend away the scheme but lands in trouble herself. In a film crowded with energy and camera movement, the climax is a standout  HFA Description &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the novel by Kazu Otsuka, Pigs and Battleships is a wry, acerbically blunt, provocative, and irreverent satire on exploitation, greed, instinctuality, lawlessness, and imposition of cultural identity. From the establishing crane shot of the port town that reduces its inhabitants into near-imperceptible, animated dots , Shohei Imamura creates a caricatured and hyperbolic, yet intrinsically incisive allegory for the turbulent cultural conditions of occupied Japan as the nation?s fragile and uncertain path towards democratization becomes increasingly supplanted by exploitive opportunism and economic anarchy, and the inevitable tide of modernization and globalism (through Westernization) are reduced into ideologically detached pop culture imitation and crass consumerism.     Strictly Film School &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if this could happen today.... Director Imamura's most famous quote appears to be:  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I  am interested in the relationship of the lower part of the human body and the lower part of the social structure on which the reality of daily Japanese life supports itself.&amp;quot;   I take this to mean Imamura is not for the faint of heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HFA is screening 18 of Imaurura's films in December and so if you cannot attend this one, you might want to check out their Calendar for other of his films: &lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2007novedec/imamura.html#pigs" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is our custom, Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row after the film and then its off to a local restaurant to discuss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there, &lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197331437000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196043736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pigs and Battleships- A Tale of Post WWII Japan</name><id>6802629</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197158400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6802629/</event_url></item>
