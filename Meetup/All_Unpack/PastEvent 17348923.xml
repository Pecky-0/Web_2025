&lt;p&gt;I just talked to Sam and his plan is to provide some mini pies and sausage rolls and other Aussie snacks for us, as well as a selection of Australian beer and wine.&amp;nbsp; We will be charging a small entry fee to cover costs: $10 for drinkers, $5 for non drinkers.&amp;nbsp; After we leave the shop around 10pm we'll head down to Lucky's Lounge (&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;355 Congress Street, Boston) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;for some live music. Shaping up to be a great night, looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Come and relax on a Friday evening after work and enjoy some Aussie food and a few cold beers.
