The Internet allows knitters to connect, share interests and learn from each other, whether across the street or across the globe. Among the first Internet knitting phenomena was the popular KnitList with thousands of members. In 1998, the first online knitting magazine, KnitNet, began publishing. Blogging later added fuel the development of an international knitting community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patterns from both print and online sources have inspired groups (known as knit-a-long's, or KAL's) centered on knitting a specific pattern. Knitting podcasts, such as Cast-On and Knit Cast, have also emerged, with much cross-pollination of ideas from blogs, 'zines, and knitting books. Traditional designs and techniques that had been preserved by a relatively small number of hand-knitters are now finding a wider audience as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Membership fee of $5 due this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267458798000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247108377000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Knit Night   -Wednesday Feb 24th</name><id>10836046</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267054200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10836046/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/e/global_9564974.jpeg</photo_url></item>
