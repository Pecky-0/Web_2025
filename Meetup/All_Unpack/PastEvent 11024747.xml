Drum Circles are a great way to stay connected to our inner rhythms. You'll learn some new rhythms, get some technique help and meet some great people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will come together at 2PM at The Charles River. Please bring some food to share if you can. Check after NOON to see if we had to move this indoors due to rain. All you have to do is call. Please call 781-648-0066 for further info or just come! Bring your drums or use ours. We will have plenty of drums and bring some yummy food and drink to share. On the day of the circle call 617.686.6080 / my cell.

The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ” &lt;br /&gt;Irene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ This was a fun time. Alan's leadership style is loose, offering suggestions and some instruction. Nice group of people, too.”&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ It is the best drumming circle in the area! People really come together in a community, and with a community spirit. Instruments are provided if you don't have one. ... ” &lt;br /&gt;A former member&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drumconnection.com"&gt;The DrumConnection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll welcome you at the door! ...and make sure you are very comfortable.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>1328052</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250363755000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Drummers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DrumConnection</urlname><id>886763</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>The Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249327167000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Drum Circle Meetup and Bar-B-Que! - Come Celebrate!</name><id>11024747</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249754400000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DrumConnection/events/11024747/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/6/global_3485414.jpeg</photo_url></item>
