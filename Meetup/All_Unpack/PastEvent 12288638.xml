<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>If you could really use a break this Friday evening after work, two of us Brunch and More members already plan to grab some dinner and go check out the 9.45pm show of &amp;quot;Up In The Air&amp;quot; at the AMC Loews Boston Common afterwards. Yes, it's the same movie being posted for a second time this week, but a couple of us would like to go see it and can't make it on Tue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't promise but in all likelihood, I might be able to get hold of some cheaper tickets for the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to come, please RSVP and I will send out details (of dinner venue etc) later in the week. For now, just plan on meeting at the theater venue at 7pm for dinner and movie. Dinner will most likely be someplace close to the theater.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rajjo</member_name><member_id>8334158</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263773655000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263236582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Dinner and Movie</name><id>12288638</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263600000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/12288638/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/3/global_12164739.jpeg</photo_url></item>
