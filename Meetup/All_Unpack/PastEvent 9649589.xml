There were hundreds of kites flying throughout the day.  The event starts at 10:00 AM with some early arrivals but the bulk of the kites are up in the air by noon-ish.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at noon and shoot throughout the afternoon.  We'll regroup for a bite to eat at Santorini's just down the street from Kelly's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details as the event gets closer.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>More details as the event gets closer</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>5274985</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244395708000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233532936000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revere Beach Kite Festival - May</name><id>9649589</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243699200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/9649589/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/7/c/global_7847500.jpeg</photo_url></item>
