We will order in pizza and subs and everyone will pay for their own meal. Due to the space, we have to limit this event to 20 people and to members only. We are asking each person attending to give a $2.00 donation to our Mitzvah fund. Please reply as soon as possible and join us in an evening of fun and games.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy B.</member_name><member_id>11339653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363486531000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>425314</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Jewish Singles 55+  of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360520664000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game night Saturday March 16</name><id>dsgbkfyrfbvb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363474800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston/events/103953402/</event_url></item>
