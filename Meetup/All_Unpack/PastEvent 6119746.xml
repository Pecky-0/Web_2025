The entrance to the boat ramp is at the traffic light at the intersection of Rt. 20 and Edgemere Blvd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll paddle through the pond and into Lake Quinsigammond.  It's a great place for an after-work paddle, relatively quiet and usually a decent amount of wildlife to view!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186870222000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186147857000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak/Canoe Flint Pond, Shrewsbury</name><id>6119746</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186696800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/6119746/</event_url></item>
