No one more exemplifies this than Gardner – inspired by art, music, gardens, travel, and the world around her, she was the ultimate Renaissance Woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Courtyard Sounds: Enjoy music by up-and-coming musicians from the New England Conservatory (5:30-8:30pm)&lt;br /&gt;    * Gallery Travels: Explore the galleries with a self-guided tour of Renaissance highlights in the collection.&lt;br /&gt;    * Viewfinder: Visit the Dutch Room and get acquainted with some of the personalities at home here.
