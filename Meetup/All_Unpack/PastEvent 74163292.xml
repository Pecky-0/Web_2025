&lt;p&gt;Music by Roger Dee &lt;br /&gt;

He began his music career in 1990 after working as a graffiti artist and member of the b-boy group Crazy Break. He has opened shows for renowned Brazilian artists such as Thaíde and DJ Hum. Over time, his career has evolved and branched out into many styles, including hip hop, funk and original breakbeats as well as Brazilian music. Currently, Roger Dee operates his own label, Acla Music, and runs free workshops in Belo Horizonte dedicated to transmitting the culture of urban music to young people.&lt;/p&gt;
