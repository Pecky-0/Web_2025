Perhaps you have an idea for something new or want to revive and old creative hobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What people are saying about this monthly event..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ Really had a fun time, great to put faces with names and see what fun things folks were doing. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“  Great group of people. I especially enjoyed viewing everyone's work. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ It was really interesting to see work of other members and their different perspective about creative ideas. The only thing I didn't like was that only 7 members showed up when till the last moment there were 17 Yes to this Meetup. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ Nice location, good size group for me since I was new. It was smaller (7 total) but easier to get to know people. Nice work shown, too. Paul was great at collecting info to send out. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ A wonderful group of people - this was my first time at a meetup - and great to compare notes on various artistic endeavors. The event was well-organized. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ Wonderful time, everyone was really connecting and showing their work. These just keep getting better and better - can't wait for the next one! ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ This is a great event and loved hearing about what everyone else is doing. Definitely spurred some creative energy! Really enjoyed meeting and connecting with everyone. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;“ Was fun! Nice to meet you all and see your work. ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on your poll choices we are having our creative event at a different day &amp;amp; time from those in the past. If I get a good turnout, I'll do more like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will run with a minimum of 4 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS here's Finale's site for directions &amp;amp; parking: &lt;a href="http://www.finaledesserts.com/locations-cambridge.php#directions" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.finaledess...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come in and ask the staff</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238192671000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Creative People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCreative</urlname><id>919281</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Creative People</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234895292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March Creative Meet, Greet, Show and Tell</name><id>9760687</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236468600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCreative/events/9760687/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/b/global_6810507.jpeg</photo_url></item>
