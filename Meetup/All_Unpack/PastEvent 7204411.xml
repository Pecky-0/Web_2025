Prices have surged to all-time highs. Investors have been buying more gold than ever before in history. Questions have arisen such as: &amp;quot;How long can this go on?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What's behind the move in gold?&amp;quot; Join us on Friday, March 7 as Senior Analyst Jon Nadler of Kitco.com explains these and answers other questions. Jon will cover the latest statistical findings in key areas on the fundamental side (mine production, jewelry demand, central banks, individual investors) and highlight shifting trends that no investor should ignore. On the practical side, Jon will share with us his thoughts on gold as money, and why anyone with assets worth protecting should consider gold in their portfolio - but not for the reasons one might commonly think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bio:&lt;/b&gt; Jon and his family fled Communist Romania and came to the US when he was 18. They escaped persecution to create a better life in the West. Jon's first connection to gold came out of the act of leaving his native land. His family sewed a handful of gold coins into their clothes. This gold became seed money for their life in America and meant a ticket to college at UCLA for Jon. He graduated with degrees in European Languages and Special Fields, then he completed the UCLA Business Executive Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon's career includes starting retail metals investment operations at 3 financial institutions:&lt;br /&gt; - In 1977 with Deak-Perera, the USA's oldest and largest foreign exchange firm at that time. He managed gold and silver retailing, created Swiss-style certificate programs for retail investors and served as spokesman for precious metals at trade shows and in the media.&lt;br /&gt; - At Republic National Bank (now HSBC) - the oldest and largest gold bullion bank in the USA - he started gold and silver wholesale trading relationships, ran a retail precious metals sales department for RNB,  and spoke for RNB at precious metals forums and to the media.&lt;br /&gt; - From 1985, for 16 years, Jon served as a senior officer at Bank of America, the 2nd largest US financial institution, in Beverly Hills, California.
