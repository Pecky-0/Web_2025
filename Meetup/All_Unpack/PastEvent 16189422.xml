Through the movement of the spirit, women can learn of the power and healing that comes when one aligns themselves with the creative and benevolent forces of the universe. Regain your connection at this women’s seminar and join the ranks of the wise women and healers of history. &lt;br /&gt;Please note: this seminar is for &lt;b&gt;WOMEN ONLY&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also this weekend: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fear: Why We Are Afraid and the Path to Fearlessness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, January 27 • 7:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25 - Bring a Friend for Free!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Joy of Being Single&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, January 28 • 7:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25 - Bring a Friend for Free!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
