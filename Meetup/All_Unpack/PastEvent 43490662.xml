And should a camp meal cost THAT much?&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;if so, you are a perfect candidate to join us for the Dehydration 101 presentation by Kellie Anne Connelly. Preserving food and getting it to a lighter pack weight is not a new idea, but we have become more and more reliant on prepackaged commercial goods that have high sodium content, added preservatives, lost nutritional value, and a high price tag to meet our backcountry needs. This presentation will cover the basics of food dehydration, necessary equipment, suitable foods, shortcuts, and some recipes that you can use to start creating your own backcountry meals. Kellie has been developing her own selection of dehydrated meals, snacks, granola and beef jerky over the last six years; which have been successfully field tested as the group meals or snacks when she is co-leading AMC Hiking/Backpacking trips. She has also used her dehydration techniques to put together well balanced meals for long excursions backpacks on the AT 100-mile Wilderness and Kootenay&amp;rsquo;s Rockwall. Kellie will review trip meal planning, packaging and storage as part of the presentation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
