This month we will have a segment with Jeff leading members of the group to volunteer how they are trading this volatile market. We will poll the room to find out different holding periods and then look for people to volunteer their strategies for trading. In addition we will have our market discussion and stock picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are working to distill the knowledge of everyone in the room. This Wednesday meeting in March will have no formal speaker so that we can have enough time to talk among ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Market Talk led by Doug Roberts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug has delivered his Market Talk ever since we moved to MIT. The banter in our group of bulls versus bears has become vigorous as the market alternately rallies and tumbles. Join this discussion as Doug gives his perspective on fundamentals, technicals and sentiment. Doug is one of the leaders of the group and is a full-time trader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets during the hour from 6:00 PM to 6:50 PM.
