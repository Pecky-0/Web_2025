Well, Martin Marks is back doing accompaniment again -- this time to the British travel film the Open Road. Just being able to watch Marks perform is worth it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Open Road (65 min.). Early silent films with live piano accompaniment by Martin Marks. In 1924 Claude Friese-Greene (cinematographer and son of the British moving-image pioneer William Friese-Greene) embarked on an intrepid road trip between the two geographical extremities of Great Britain from Land's End in the Southwest to John O'Groats in northeast Scotland. This travelogue was conceived as a series of shorts, twenty-six episodes in all. In the 1920s, Claude's two-color tinted system failed to reach a large audience owing to heavy flicker and color fringing. Now, a special compilation of highlights from the journey has been restored by the BFI National Archive, using digital intermediate technology to remove the technical defects of the original. The result is a fascinating portrait of inter-war Britain, in which town and country, people and landscapes are captured in a rich color palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole. She will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater during the credits, so we can meet up and head off to a local cafe for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194286566000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193682175000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vintage British Travelogues with Live Piano Accompaniment!</name><id>6638214</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194113700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6638214/</event_url></item>
