As usual, socializing and pizza will start at 6:30pm, and the presentation will start at 7:00pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be on vacation so Vineet Sinha of Architexa will be hosting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Doug&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Write Once Run Anywhere&amp;quot; has long been one of the pillars of Java, but what are the challenges of building web based application that run in multiple situations. Java allows us to run applications anywhere, but very often different environments have implications on capabilities provide by a web app. While standards like JPA and JAX-RS make it easy to use different implementations, but we typically need to consider many issues such as technology limitations, service architecture, and design techniques for integrating the effectively. In this talk, we present a web-based collaboration application that we have build and deployed in multiple environments - from running locally on users desktops, running within companies intranets, to running in different cloud environments. We discuss our RESTful service, and talk about technologies like GAE, Hibernate, Jersey, Derby that we have been used to accomplish this. The talk focuses on the challenges faced, and some of the solutions used to overcome these. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abhishek is working on a building usable tools for helping developers see their code as diagrams and easily share them with other team members. As part of this, he has been building the server side collaboration capabilities for Architexa after finishing his Master's in CS in 2009. As a developer he is passionate about helping developers work with code, in particular using design patterns effectively and in building tools that will help them get control of their code. Apart from helping developers  his interests also lie in Enterprise Network Security. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284475578000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Java Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-java</urlname><id>87071</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Java Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278786915000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September - Write Once Run Anywhere on the Server Side</name><id>smqtnynmbjb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284417000000</time><rsvp_limit>100</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-java/events/14061380/</event_url></item>
