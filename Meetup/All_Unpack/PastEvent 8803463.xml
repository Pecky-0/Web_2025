Sorry that my many commitments did not allow me to be present at our last meeting (September 21). However, I heard that everything went well with a creative sharing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 21 people shared and commented on the intro and chapter 1-3 of the book &amp;quot;LIVING BUDDHA, LIVING CHRIST&amp;quot;. On October 26 we can continue, since the impression was that there is no need to rush through the book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my own reading, I picked some lines I want to share with you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Most of the boundaries between traditions are artificial. Truth has no boundaries. The differences are mostly in emphasis.&lt;br /&gt;+ For dialogue to be fruitful, we need to live deeply our own tradition and at the same time, look and listen deeply to others. We can appreciate the beauty and value of our won and the other's tradition.&lt;br /&gt;+ To stand straight and grow strong, we need roots.&lt;br /&gt;+ Dialogue must begin, first of all, within oneself. If we cannot make peace within, how can we hope to bring about peace in the world?&lt;br /&gt;+ True love is possible only with understanding. When there is understanding, compassion is born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this wonderful book. I am looking forward to seeing you again soon,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have a Wonderful Weekend,&lt;br /&gt;                                                &lt;br /&gt;PEACE&lt;br /&gt;Fr.
