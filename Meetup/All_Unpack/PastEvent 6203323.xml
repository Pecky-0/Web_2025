We are going to meet as originally planned this Friday 9/21 but at 6 pm instead of 7 pm.  Our venue (Me and Ollie's on Water Street in Exeter) closes at 7 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting will be social and discussion-oriented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and have a beverage and/or snack and meet others who are interested in sustainable living, peak oil and related issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will discuss our interests and which topics we'd like to explore as a group this fall and winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also talk about the best ways to publicize Dr. Barry Rocks's presentation on 10/5.  I have sent out several press releases but could use some help with the flyers and less traditional methods of publicizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to our meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathy Esmonde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy Esmonde</member_name><member_id>3657409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190808806000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Green Earthlings</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-286</urlname><id>459660</id><group_lat>43.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast  Energy and Permaculture Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187464147000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Peak Oil/Sustainable Living September Meetup</name><id>6203323</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190412000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-286/events/6203323/</event_url></item>
