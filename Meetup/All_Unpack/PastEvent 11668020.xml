Our Healer share is twice as much fun since we have Reiki happening in one room and Full Spectrum Healing going on in the other room. Try (or give!) some of each!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Share is open to all Reiki practitioners from all levels, backgrounds and teachers. It's a chance to practice Reiki, ask questions and help someone too. If you are Reiki curious, come and check it out, see what Reiki is all about for yourself and best off, try some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Spectrum Healing is what we teach at The Rhys Thomas Institute of Energy Medicine at Solstice. (It's Barbara Brennan style...) Come on and try it, it feels great!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Campion</member_name><member_id>9185187</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256771537000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People interested in healing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Metrowest-Reiki-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1415890</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Metrowest Reiki and Energy Healers Share</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256040201000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE Healer  (Reiki) Share</name><id>11668020</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256598000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Metrowest-Reiki-Meetup-Group/events/11668020/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/5/7/global_7810183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
