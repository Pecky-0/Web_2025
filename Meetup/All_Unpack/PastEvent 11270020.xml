He'll bring videos of the examination and controlled combustion of some of these particles, as well as videos of some observations of the collapse of the towers that can only be attributed to explosive processes. This WILL be good! Please don't miss this session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should have time for other videos as well, so be sure to bring your favorites for us to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short subjects&lt;/b&gt; - bring what you think others should see - we'll see what shorts we have time to view.
