Come to the comic book brunch where we will discuss our favorites over some classic brunch options:  &lt;a href="http://www.burren.com/food.html"&gt;http://www.burren.com/food.html&lt;/a&gt;. After food, we can stop off at the local comic book store, Comicazi ( &lt;a href="http://www.comicazi.com/"&gt;http://www.comicazi.com/&lt;/a&gt;) to browse and point out the comics we were discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no set agenda, but hopefully it will be a little more focused to comics from the overall sci-fi/fantasy genre. If people are interested, we can do this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burren and Comicazi are both in Davis Square, conveniently located on the Red Line. For those who drive, the parking meters are free on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's a relatively small place- so it shouldn't be hard to find us. If, for some reason, we can't get a table in the main room, just ask for us and they'll point you in the right direction.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn</member_name><member_id>9373103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349139856000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347631031000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Comic Book Brunch (with comic store trip)</name><id>82374752</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349017200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/82374752/</event_url></item>
