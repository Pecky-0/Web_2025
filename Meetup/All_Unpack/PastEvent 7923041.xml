Further to the east on the lake is a beach area that would be an excellent place to sit on the sand to eat some snacks. And to practice paddle float entries...if you have not one of these things...its a real life saver....&lt;br /&gt;you will see why..oh yeh and a pump...sponge , bail bucket..is ok too..but no where near the capacity of a good pump...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason 1..standing in the mud up to your waiste is not fun if you even make it that far to the shore..most likely you are going to die here like those stickey traps for mice....reason 2 :better to pop back in fast, pump out fast and get going...There is hungry LEACHES, EELS, and Frankenstein Fish in there....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Rte 384 East to Bolton Notch (off of rte 84 in East Hartford / Manchester line area)&lt;br /&gt;Follow 384 to the end..&lt;br /&gt;Continue on Rte 44 E (left part of fork) rte 6 is to the right, stay on 44&lt;br /&gt;There is a traffic light with a post office and a small shopping area to the right, (Quarry Rd off to the left).. you will pass vernon rd, lakeside and keeny also)  .... continue to the next traffic light.&lt;br /&gt;The next light has the boat launch to the left and a church to the right. (across from South Road, bolton)&lt;br /&gt;Enter the boat launch area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry my kayak on a old sailboat trailer so im easy to spot. But look for us on the water if you arrive later..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mapquest, GPS and others use 1,050 Boston Turnpike (rte 44) Bolton to get you close enough..&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have my Blue Toyota Avalon with a Kayak Trailer and a few Orange Traffic Cones.
We will be on the water and most likely near the sand shore opposite of the boat launch..
Some others may be out and about the lake...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AL-r</member_name><member_id>2711041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210977406000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><why>Its wet and wild..</why><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210614576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunset Paddle on Bolton Lake, Bolton CT... and Something MORE</name><id>7923041</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210804200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/7923041/</event_url></item>
