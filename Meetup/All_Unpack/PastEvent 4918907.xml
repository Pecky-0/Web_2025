There are a lot of references to it in the book so here we go. Feel free to invite friends and family to this Afghan feast. I have been to this restaurant a few times. The food is quite good. Please RSVP either way a week prior. I will call them and make reservations a week before this dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each person is responsible for the price of their own dinner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melissa</member_name><member_id>3059165</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1146536700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate the Kite Runner!</name><id>4918907</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1150498800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/4918907/</event_url></item>
