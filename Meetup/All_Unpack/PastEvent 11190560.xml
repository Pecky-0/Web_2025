WE WILL PROBABLY MAKE ONE STOP IN THE MIDDLE FOR A WATER BREAK.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm guess we'll be going at 12-13 miles per hour...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at the parking lot in the front of Fort Adams (near the food vendors to the right) at 9am on Sunday, August 30th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to be riding on the roads.  That means cars - not a whole lot, but some.  For this reason, we recommend that you bring a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things you should bring include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) A bicycle&lt;br /&gt;b) Lots of water&lt;br /&gt;c) Sunglasses!!  Very important as it will be very sunny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to be traveling at a decent speed - you don't have to be a professional athlete to keep up, but we won't be going at a snail's pace either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a joint meetup between the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/"&gt;Newport Friends&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Bicycling/"&gt;Providence bicycling meetup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions?
