Most of the concert will be sung in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be there by noon, music starts promptly at 12:10 (don't be late!).  Be sure your cell phone is off (vibrate-only isn't good enough).  If you can't stay until the end just be sure to leave in a break between music when others have started applauding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's ok to eat at the concert but please keep it quiet. Crinkly bags/wrappers and big celery stalks wouldn't be great choices.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOST: &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/members/2469731/"&gt;Alexis&lt;/a&gt;, cell 203-747-9203.  However, she won't be answering her phone starting an hour before the concert, and obviously not during it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POST-PARTY: After the performance feel free to say &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; and simper &amp;amp; fawn over them.  Post-party is TBD...it's relatively likely Alexis &amp;amp; Frank will want to get lunch or a drink, people are welcome to join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hear some of Frank at his site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frankmartignetti.com"&gt;www.frankmartignetti.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hear Alexis playing some Mozart at her site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist"&gt;www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING: Don't expect to find parking on Audubon St. (which is a 1-way street).  Grove &amp;amp; Whitney have street parking, and there are &lt;a href="http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/ParkingAuthority/images/map.gif"&gt;parking garages&lt;/a&gt; in the area (such as on Grove, &amp;amp; on Audubon).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192982544000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190228456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fri 10/19-2 NHCers in concert, lyrics by dead Irish monks &amp; Greeks!</name><id>6390329</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192809600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6390329/</event_url></item>
