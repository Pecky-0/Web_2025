Cards also available at all events after 8/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice cream location TBD, got a place in mind, let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Scooters</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218839635000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218055093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Marketing ride, divide and conquer!</name><id>8491528</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218666600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/8491528/</event_url></item>
