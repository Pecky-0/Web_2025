We have a small, supportive core group that is committed to meeting, getting to know each other, and supporting each other.  We invite more people to join us.  You would receive a goal handout on which you can write down one small, measurable goal and can also track your progess. You will only get a handout if you rsvp with a &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; by 3pm on Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be away on vacation from March 10-18, so I cannot lead a meeting on the 17th or on the 24th for personal reasons.  I will work on getting a host for one of these dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPCOMING MEETING: Guest speaker (professional organizer) on April 7th---to be confirmed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME REASONS TO JOIN THIS MEETUP:&lt;br /&gt;Do you not invite guests to your home for parties because you are embarrased about how it looks?&lt;br /&gt;Do you block off a room in your house when you have company so they can't see all the stuff in there?&lt;br /&gt;Do you have multiple storage units and you don't know what is where?&lt;br /&gt;Do you have piles of papers on your desk and you aren't sure where to put them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLUTTER BUDDIES:&lt;br /&gt;Some people have found clutter buddies who support each other in reaching their goals.  One person from Quincy is still trying to find one. Let me know if you need a buddy and would like to contact her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be  on the patio on the left side as you enter Panera.
