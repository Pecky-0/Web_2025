This is the same group that we do the Wings and Wheels show with, but this isn't the Wings and Wheels event. This is a show that they host by themselves, but they have offered us some space to park a couple of airplanes and setup a table. At this table, we can provide information about our Wings and Wheels, Young Eagles, and Learn to Fly events as well as general information about why airports and pilots are so great to the thousands of people they bring in. Since their event is on 2/20, this is too easy to pass up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://clubs.hemmings.com/clubsites/earlyfordv8newengland/Fleamarket.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://clubs.hemmings...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the SETUP day. I believe we are only required to show up and plan out what we want to do the next day. In addition to myself, it might be nice to have one or two other people who will be there Sunday to help get things ready.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271682641000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266173799000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Early Ford V8 Club's Car Show - Setup</name><id>12602744</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271509200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/12602744/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
