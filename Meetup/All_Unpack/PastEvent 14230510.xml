It has been the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home since 1937. The name Tanglewood comes from the book &amp;quot;Tanglewood Tales&amp;quot; by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne wrote the book while living in a cottage in Lenox in the early 1850's. The name was taken on by a nearby estate which was eventually donated to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whalesandwolves.com/tanglewood.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.whalesandw...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maia</member_name><member_id>3083598</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281915915000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280254512000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Magical Tanglewood</name><id>14230510</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281911400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/14230510/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/b/b/global_16759211.jpeg</photo_url></item>
