We'll meet in front of Bigelow Chapel on Chapel Ave. Please see this link for directions &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/ybbnun9" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/yb...&lt;/a&gt; . On your way into the cemetery I believe there is a place to stop for maps and information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've decided to do an impromptu shoot at Mount Auburn Cemetery this Sunday, weather permitting, and thought members of the CAPE Group may be interested in joining me! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note... Occasionally I volunteer to visit area cemeteries to find, and photograph, headstones for families in need of genealogy information. It's somewhat like a scavenger hunt &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;! If anyone has an interest in learning more about this, please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.findagrave.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Find a Grave&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site for more information. There are currently 17 people looking for headstone photos in &lt;a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=rapList&amp;amp;rapMode=cemetery&amp;amp;rapCemeteryId=91241" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mount Auburn Cemetery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I'll have the full list with me on Sunday if anyone is interested in hunting along too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; Mount Auburn Cemetery&lt;br /&gt;           580 Mt Auburn St&lt;br /&gt;           Cambridge, MA 02138&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, November 15, 2009 at 12p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Rain Date: Sunday, November 29, 2009 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Boston via Storrow Drive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Storrow Drive West past Harvard Square exit.
