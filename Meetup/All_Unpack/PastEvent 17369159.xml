&lt;p&gt;The concert features a phenomenal young violinist, &lt;span style="color : #ff9900"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aishu Venkataraman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and several Berklee professors such as &lt;span style="color : #ff9900"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marc Rossi, Bob Tamagni and Bill Urmson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aishu is the youngest graduate from the Berklee school of Jazz. She has acquired a passion for the violin that transcends boundaries from the western hemisphere all the way to the far east. Blending technique with melody Aishu keeps sharing with the world her talent, her poise and grace far beyond her years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concert is a fundraiser for International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal: In 1984, the Indian city of Bhopal witnessed the world's worst industrial disaster with leakage of lethal Methyl Isocyanate gas from the Union Carbide factory (current owner- Dow Chemicals). The Disaster is still happening with toxic contamination of the ground water because of the refusal by Dow to clean up the factory's dump site.  The International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal ( ICJB) is a non-profit organization supporting the Bhopal Gas Disaster's survivors and victims.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
