 &lt;br /&gt;

Of particular interest to anyone concerned about the current national security situation, both its expensive mis-adventures abroad and its intrusive violation of many Constitutional rights at home, is the author's history, not only as a the most decorated Marine at the time, but as a spokesperson, in retirement, for placing constitutional American principles over imperialist American practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is very short and is &lt;a href="http://www.warisaracket.com/"&gt;available FREE online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Butler's particular contribution was his recantation, denouncing war on moral grounds after having been a warrior hero and spending most of his life as a military insider. The theme remained vigorously patriotic and nationalistic, decrying imperialism as a disgrace rooted in the greed of a privileged few." - Hans Schmidt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All are invited to come and discuss (even if you haven't read the book!) WHAT WARS ARE WORTH FIGHTING?&lt;/p&gt;
