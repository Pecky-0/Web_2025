Ancient medical practitioners were aware of how our bodies regulated this flow of energy. These practitioners developed detailed maps of the various energy systems and how they affect our emotional and physical health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn the system of Energy Gates and powerful energy psychology techniques that will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Step-by-step, safely and effortlessly decrease anxiety, eliminate persistent worries, and create states of profound healing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Significantly lower your stress levels and lower your levels of brain chemicals related to anxiety, and increase your production of vital (and very pleasurable) brain chemicals related to your well-being&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Dramatically improve your ability to sleep better, focus, concentrate and think more clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Stimulate the creation of new neural pathways between the right and left hemispheres of your brain, balancing your brain and leading you to a high-performance state, scientists call &amp;quot;whole brain functioning”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately millions of people have no choice but to try to live in this debilitating state of discomfort that results from energetic misalignment. You do not want to be one of them. I am inviting you to embark on an exciting journey to the new anxiety and trauma-free you. Let us get started. Join us for a highly experiential presentation, live demonstration and personal practices. Warm welcome to everyone! I am looking forward to meeting all of you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schedule&lt;br /&gt;7:00 – 7:15 Meetup and introduction&lt;br /&gt;7:15 – 8:30 Power point presentation and live demonstration&lt;br /&gt;8:30 – 9:15 Personal practice and sharing&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Accesible by Green LIne C, Washington Square Stop.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yuliya Cohen</member_name><member_id>6311859</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310524603000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People on a healing journey</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma</urlname><id>1373363</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Freedom from Fear/ Anxiety /Emotional Trauma Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289016751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Four Gates To Recovery: The Forgotten path of Returning to Wholeness. </name><id>15357200</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289520000000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma/events/15357200/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/3/global_10137539.jpeg</photo_url></item>
