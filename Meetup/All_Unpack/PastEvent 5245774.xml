A heady mixture of probability theory, psychology, and comedy, this show revives a tradition in which audiences attended the theatre to see scientific demonstrations as entertainment. The climax involves generating six foot long bolts of lightning between two specifically constructed coils, with one of the performers entering a coffin-shaped cage and absorbing the full force of the lethal strikes. An experimental psychologist and former professional magician, Professor Richard Wiseman teams up with a physicist and popular science author, Dr. Simon Singh (author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385493622/humanistassoc-20" target="_blank"&gt;Fermat's Enigma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007152523/humanistassoc-20" target="_blank"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The spirit of Houdini lives on&amp;quot; -- The Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The most frightening and bizarre show in town.&amp;quot; -- The Daily Mail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is part of the Science and Arts Festival of NY.
