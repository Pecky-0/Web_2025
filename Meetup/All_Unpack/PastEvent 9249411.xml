It's a Tex-Mex and American fare restaurant and the owners are open to exploration of the truth.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.911weknow.com/911-mysteries-movie.html" target="_blank"&gt;9/11 Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is this month's selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This very well made early 9/11 Truth video is an easy-to-digest starter movie if you are new to the movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;90 minutes of pure demolition evidence and analysis, laced with eye-opening witness testimonials.  Moving from &amp;quot;the myth&amp;quot; through &amp;quot;the analysis&amp;quot; and into &amp;quot;the players,&amp;quot; careful deconstruction of the official story set right alongside clean, clear science.  The 9/11 picture is not one of politics or nationalism or loyalty, but one of strict and simple physics.  How do you get a 10-second 110-story pancake collapse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A movie that might actually reach our complacent mainstream.  No agenda.  No finger-pointing.  Just the facts and the &amp;quot;mysteries.&amp;quot;  Look at that.  Think about this.  A story of people: Willie Rodriguez's strange recollection of noises on the 34th floor.  Who was up there, bumping around?  Scott Forbes' similar story, weeks before the towers fell.  A story of blasting itself.  Here's how shaped charges slice through steel beams to control the way they fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: 1st Tuesday-Nashua; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord; &lt;b&gt;4th Tuesday-Bristol.&lt;/b&gt; If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, we'll have a special meeting!&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting to the truth is left to us!&lt;/b&gt; Let's measure up to the task.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll have free DVD's&lt;/b&gt; and DVD's and books for sale. Everyone should bring their collection for trading, viewing, copying, etc. Bring your favorite books, too. We've developed a collection of books for sale at these various meetings.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donations&lt;/b&gt; - we ask for a donation in the $5 range to help us continue to build our library of books, DVD's and other materials. Please come in any event if you can't afford the $5.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive earlier than 7:00 PM&lt;/b&gt; to order appetizers, dinner or drinks, and we'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and the video will begin after that.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking&lt;/b&gt; is on the street in front of the restaurant.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newspaper&lt;/b&gt; - For an interesting paper which covers 9/11 Truth issues and other topics of concern, visit the &lt;a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rock Creek Free Press&lt;/a&gt; out of Washington, D.C.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carpooling&lt;/b&gt; - Merrimack Valley 911 Truth has set up a &amp;quot;carpooling group&amp;quot; online at &lt;a href="http://mv911t.eRideShare.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://mv911t.eRideSh...&lt;/a&gt;.
