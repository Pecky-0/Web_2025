The book I'm using is called &amp;quot;Understanding the Times&amp;quot; by David A. Noebel. This book is the perfect 9/12er book and you should get a copy! Are you ready? This one's going to be good and this is right in the direction Glenn Beck has been going with his discourse on Divine Providence vs. Manifest Destiny. This will be a great introduction to a week which will be one for the history books!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett Berchin&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283191935000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>We Surround Them</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Western-Mass-912-Project</urlname><id>1394602</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6299972534</group_lon><name>The Original WMass 912 Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282405443000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>West Springfield Meeting</name><id>vlptnynlbfc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282600800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Western-Mass-912-Project/events/14493883/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/9/global_7591481.jpeg</photo_url></item>
