 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Getting off of Exit 2 while heading east on Route 101 proceed south (right at end of ramp) on Hooksett Rd. for 0.8 miles passing Holidays Bar and Grill. Turn left onto Depot Rd. and proceed 0.2 miles passing 23 Depot Rd. There is a dirt parking lot on the left.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;We will be doing a line hike that is 2.46 miles one way (5 miles round trip) hiking along the Rockingham Recreational Trail (relatively flat, wide rail trail) from the Tunnel that goes under Hooksett Road in Auburn to the Tunnel that goes under Route 101 in Candia.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;As it is a line hike anyone getting tired before the hike reaches the turn around point can easily find their way back as we will be returning along the exact same route on an easy to follow trail.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;There is one spot where it looked like the dogs could access some water that appeared to be okay to swim or wade in.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;During the hike there are 3 different roads that we will be crossing that could have traffic on them that are easily spotted before you get to them as there are gates and signs before one gets to the roads.
