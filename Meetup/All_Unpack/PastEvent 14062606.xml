Facilitated by Andrea  and Andy.   (There is also a chance we may have a local author and mom as an informal guest speaker.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Apologies to Andy &amp;amp; Andrea that this didn't get posted in advance!  I hope people can still attend. From the internal email list I believe we already have around a dozen women going. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  Socializing before the meeting starts at 7:15pm.   The discussion itself kicks off at 7:30pm and concludes at 9pm.  This is a great first Meetup for anyone interested in learning more about the chapter!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanya</member_name><member_id>7153030</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279060488000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278796757000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Raising Boys</name><id>14062606</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278977400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/14062606/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/5/a/global_8459978.jpeg</photo_url></item>
