&lt;p&gt;Well, it's been a while since we've been out there to bring some additional comfort to Boston's homeless. Even though spring is now officially here, it is still quite cold out there, day and night...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I'd like to solicit your help and bring any of the following type of apparel: gloves, mitts, hats, scarves, new socks, new underwear, coats, snow pants, face shield, sleeping bags and anything you can think of that will make someone bear the cold of the night a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size matters. But not that much. I guess medium to large is better, but we also can use some small sized item. Once we'll be done roaming the city streets, we will donate everything we have left to a local shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress warm! Check the weather forecast. We will be roaming the streets for 90 minutes, so make sure you won't yourself be cold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone is welcomed to stay after the event for some drinks at PF Changs or any place the group elect to select.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you then!&lt;/p&gt;
