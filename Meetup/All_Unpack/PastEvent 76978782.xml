&lt;p&gt;About the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the romantic comedy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ruby Sparks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Calvin (Paul Dano) is a young novelist who achieved phenomenal success early in his career but is now struggling with his writing—as well as his romantic life. Finally, he makes a breakthrough and creates a character named Ruby who inspires him. When Calvin finds Ruby (Zoe Kazan), in the flesh, sitting on his couch about a week later, he is completely flabbergasted that his words have turned into a living, breathing person. Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Little Miss Sunshine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a great deal of playfulness between the couple that will touch the romantic in most. Everything about their relationship is fine, near perfection, until they venture out into the real world where issues like love, hate, envy, regret and ex-girlfriends tend to complicate matters. But mostly the movie is about how to make reality and romance with Ruby a dream, which happens to be far harder than turning a dream girl into reality in the first place." -- LA Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
