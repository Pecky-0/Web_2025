&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Event Rating: Strenuous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Distance: 7.5 Miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Time Duration: 3.5 Hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blaze Orange: Recommended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of the popularity of the NST Hikes, the difficulty of this hike and a maximum number of hikers allowed, this section is only open only to members (No Guests) who have successfully completed at least 5 of the more challenging hikes with the RIHC and are truly interested in completed ALL sections of the NST.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Section 3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is 7.5 miles in length with 3.5 miles in wooded areas and 4 miles on asphalt roads. Please allow at least 4 hours for the hike and carpooling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A good pair of waterproof hiking boots, 2 liters of water and power snacks will be required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Orange is Recommended for this section since we will be on narrow country roads competing with traffic during portions of this section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Priority attendance for this hike will be given to those members who are in the process of completing the NST.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
