Come join an awesome group of women who love discovering new places and can make riding for an ice cream an adventure. Build new friendships with women who love to motorcycle as much as you do. Now that you have found our meetup group...............you can also VISIT THE CLUB WEBSITE at www.newenglandthunder.com. There you will find lots more info.  Check out the pictures in our gallery showing the great rides we have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are based out of Weymouth, Massachusetts. Our members come from the South Shore, North Shore, Boston, Worcester area and RI as well. We ride almost every weekend during the summer months and for as long as we can stand it in the cooler weather!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Come to a meeting to meet the women of New England Thunder or join us on a ride......we will provide you with all the necessary information about our rides, group riding, safety procedures that we follow and membership dues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet monthly on the second Wednesday of each month (except Dec and Jan) at the Peppercornz on Main restaurant in Weymouth. Social Hour is 530 -630 pm and the meeting begins at 630 Pm. During those meetings we socialize and plan our upcoming events and riding schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Remember it is not just the ride or the destination but the company you keep and the new friends you make along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
