We &lt;br /&gt;encourage event participants to get involved in protecting the &lt;br /&gt;rights of all animals by raising awareness about the cruelty &lt;br /&gt;that exists in the factory farming and fur industries.  &lt;br /&gt;Attendees will also be treated to live performances by vegan &lt;br /&gt;musical guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tours of the beautiful Maple Farm Sanctuary grounds will be &lt;br /&gt;available throughout the event.  Tour participants will have &lt;br /&gt;the opportunity to learn the animals' stories and meet Cassie &lt;br /&gt;the cow, Piggie Wiggy the potbelly pig, Lucky the pony, &lt;br /&gt;Butterscotch the goat, along with llamas, chickens, horses, &lt;br /&gt;dogs and more.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sanctuary has taken in a fraction of the billions of farmed &lt;br /&gt;animals that are bought, sold, tormented and slaughtered by the &lt;br /&gt;meat, dairy and fur industries. They will live the remainder of &lt;br /&gt;their lives in peace, free to roam and meander the land.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are approximately 80 animals living at Maple Farm &lt;br /&gt;Sanctuary. This includes cows, horses, sheep, llamas, ducks, &lt;br /&gt;chickens, pigs, turkeys, dogs, goats, and a miniature pony.  &lt;br /&gt;Maple Farm is located on 121 acres of beautiful farm land in &lt;br /&gt;Mendon, Massachusetts.   &lt;br /&gt;See you there!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Mangus</member_name><member_id>8074795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226169349000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224365855000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Maple Farm Sanctuary 3rd Annual Open House  - Picnic, Music and Barn </name><id>8986756</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1225648800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/8986756/</event_url></item>
