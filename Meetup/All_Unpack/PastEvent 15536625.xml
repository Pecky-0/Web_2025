This is also a great opportunity to practice your Portuguese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Joana, the ultimate organizer, I had a wonderful Portuguese dining experience at Muqueca. Delicious food and outstanding service. I thought it would be great to add another meetup here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muqueca Restaurant is located in the charming neighborhood of Inman Square, less than a thirty minute walk from the major universities. It has a small family-style ambiance offering an authentic menu from the region of Espirito Santo, where seafood such as fish and shrimp flavored with cilantro, annatto seeds, and olive oil are cooked with the freshest and purest ingredients in a huge clay pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link with the menu, &lt;a href="http://www.muquecarestaurant.com/menu" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.muquecares...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For manageable conversations, we'll sit at tables of six or less.
