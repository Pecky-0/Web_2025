<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 200 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 8 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 8:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;* From western Conn, take Rt8 North to exit 39.&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp turn right onto Rt6.&lt;br /&gt;* Continue on Rt6 into Bristol then look for the stop light at the intersection on Rt6 &amp;amp; Rt69( North Side Square Plaza will be on the right just past the intersection ).&lt;br /&gt;* Turn left ( North ) onto Rt69 ( N.
