Well here is our answer, lets go out to Alfalfa Farm and check out their Fall Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Festival is free unless you participate in the Wine Tasting, other events for the day are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tours of the Farm&lt;br /&gt;Live Local Music &amp;amp; Dancing&lt;br /&gt;For the kids: Pumpkin Decorating, Face Painting &amp;amp; Grape Stomping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wine Tasting ($10pp 21+),  and take home a commemorative alfalfa farm wine glass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have never been to this winery so we are not sure of a good meeting place.  If someone has been there and would like to offer some advice, please feel free.  In the meantime I will set the meeting spot at the entrance to the store.  If you arrive and can't find us please call the meetup phone at 978-304-2811.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that if the weather is inclement this event may get cancelled.  Please check for updates prior to heading out for the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you at the winery &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; Janet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At the entrance to the store</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287438705000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>A-Circle-of-Friends</urlname><id>1421257</id><group_lat>42.8100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8799972534</group_lon><name>A Circle of Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284251600000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall Festival @ Alfalfa Farm</name><id>14738092</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287334800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/A-Circle-of-Friends/events/14738092/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/7/global_17870503.jpeg</photo_url></item>
