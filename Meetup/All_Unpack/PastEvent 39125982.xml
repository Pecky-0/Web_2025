While many would consider the idea of an Atheist going to divinity school rather strange, for John, it was a perfectly logical decision. When he finished his B.A. in philosophy at&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Vassar&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(with honours), he decided to spend a year doing community service as an AmeriCorps VISTA at a domestic violence shelter in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Butte, Montana&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John will be speaking on "Humanist Chaplaincies Across the States",&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;or&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;How The West Will Be Won&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;He&amp;nbsp;will talk about the current development of Humanist Chaplaincies and the plan to launch Humanist Chaplaincies across the United States, along the way addressing a number of misconceptions and misinformation circling about Humanist Chaplains. He will talk about his training at&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;Harvard&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Divinity School with Greg Epstein, about his early experience as the assistant Humanist chaplain at Harvard, about his plans to launch a Humanist Chaplaincy on the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take notice that this meeting is actually on the third Tuesday in November because voting takes place on the second Tuesday at the church. Don't forget to vote! As always, we will be setting up around 6:30, so feel free to come and socialize.&amp;nbsp;The program is scheduled to start at 7. &amp;nbsp;We are asking that&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;non members&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;make a small $5 donation at the door. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
