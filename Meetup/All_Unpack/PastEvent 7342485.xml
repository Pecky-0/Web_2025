Beginning on February 10th we will be in our beautiful new location at the YWCA. The time and cost will stay the same, but we will now have space for over 50 dancers, so please let your friends know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we move, we will also be making some changes to our structure, based on your feedback. At 3:30 each week we will offer a Partnering Technique class for Beginner &amp;amp; Advanced Beginner dancers, and at 3:00 &amp;amp; 4:00 we will have special class series for Intermediate/Advanced dancers. These classes can be taken as &amp;quot;drop-ins&amp;quot; or by the session, and will give you some exciting new things to practice each week. Cost: $15/class for drop-in or $95/8 weeks (additional discounts available for multiple classes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our practices will continue to run from 4:30 to 6:00, but during the first 10 minutes we will break down the basic salsa steps and do a salsa warm-up for anyone who is interested. Those who would like to start practicing on their own right away will still be able to do so, thanks to the HUGE amount of space in our new facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get more more information about these (or any) of our classes, training programs or our performance team, please feel free to contact me or visit www.metamovements.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana Masacote (manager)</member_name><member_id>2622923</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anara</member_name><member_id>2988644</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204061970000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203179351000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston/Cambridge Salsa Meetup</name><id>7342485</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203888600000</time><rsvp_limit>60</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/7342485/</event_url></item>
