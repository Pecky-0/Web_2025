Selected by a committee of 20-30 Harvard students each year, this award is given to a figure greatly admired by our students and community for both artistic and humanitarian reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2012, the HSS Cultural Humanism committee has to honor journalist Mary Roach for her outstanding contribution to Humanism in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author of New York Times best sellers Stiff, Bonk, Spook, and Packing For Mars, Mary Roach is an outspoken proponent of science, rationalism, and skepticism. Her informative and often hilarious explorations of human cadavers, sexuality, and space - among many other things - have been hugely successful. She has written for Outside, National Geographic, New Scientist, Wired, The New York Times Magazine, and Salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Flawed as it is, science remains the most solid god I've got. And so I've decided to turn to it, to see what it had to say on the topic of life after death," she writes in the introduction to Spook. "Because I know what religion says, and it perplexes me. It doesn't deliver a single, coherent, scientifically sensible or provable scenario... Science seemed the better bet."&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335399325000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335036229000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mary Roach: Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism</name><id>61548242</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335394800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/61548242/</event_url></item>
