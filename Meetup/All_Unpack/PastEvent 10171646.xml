<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be a one day hike of an Appalachian Trail section from Bull's Bridge to Kent CT.  This is a 7.5 mile hike that will include a 700 ft gain over Schagticoke Mt.  We should be on the trail for no more than 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like us to meet at the AT parking area on Rt. 341 in Kent (just past Kent School) at 9:30 a.m.  We then need to shuttle folks to where we are going to start at Bull's Bridge.  We should be on the trail for 10:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than willing to organize carpooling.  We just need to see who is coming and their schedule that day.  I do need a second car at the site to help shuttle folks. There is a great place to snack at in Kent at hike's end.  I just can't remenber the name right now, but it was really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear waterproof boots since it is Spring and there is running water and mudd.  You will need at least a liter of water and trail snacks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the distance and the elevation gains, you will want to have some experience under your belt if you plan on completing this hike in a timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the directions to Kent Nursery School.  I want you to go past the school another mile (approx.), over the river.  Go down Macedonia Rd.  The parking area is the side of the road on your left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?name=Kent+Community+Nursery+School&amp;amp;city=Kent&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=6+Bridge+St&amp;amp;zipcode=06757&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.724744&amp;amp;longitude=-73.477234&amp;amp;geocode=ADDRESS&amp;amp;id=662078" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the link towhere we are starting from at Bulls Bridge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Bulls+Bridge&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.675598&amp;amp;longitude=-73.507797&amp;amp;geocode=CITY#a/maps/m::14:41.675601:-73.507797:0:::::/e" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===  &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
