There are over 8 miles of nice wide sidewalks, the terrain is very flat (perfect for those of us that like to go leisurely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's go on out enjoy each others company, maybe grab a bite to eat and delight in all the beautiful scenery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HELMETS ARE MANDATORY, IF YOU DO NOT OWN ONE, BUY ONE, IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you come without a helmet you will not ride with us, I take safety very seriously and I do not want to be held responsible for your ignorance. &lt;br /&gt;please wear a helmet. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MBTA allows riders to bring bicycles on board the trains. . &lt;br /&gt;Remember this is always an option&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;-Bart-&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be waiting outside (sports shop side)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247871846000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246328352000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biking/RollerBlading the Boston Esplanade</name><id>10766014</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247415300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/10766014/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/global_7284256.jpeg</photo_url></item>
