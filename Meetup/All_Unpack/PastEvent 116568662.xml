&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To attend this hike, you must have previously attended a few of this group's more challenging hikes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;You must also have the hiking ability and physical conditioning to keep pace with the group, and complete the hike without any difficulty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising above the surrounding forest to a height of 2006 feet, Mount Wachusett is unique in central New England. From the summit, a clear day reveals views of Mt. Monadnock in New Hampshire, the Berkshires to the west, and the Boston skyline to the east. The 3,000-acre Wachusett Mountain State Reservation surrounds the summit and offers a wealth of natural and recreational resources. The Reservation offers 17 miles of hiking and walking trails, including 3.9 miles of the Midstate Trail, which runs from Ashburnham to the Rhode Island border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be doing a loop hike, on a number of different trails that will bring us  to the summit. and back. With the rough and rocky terrain a pair of good boots is a must. This hike has more elevation gain than any of our RI hikes, with the resulting outstanding views mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
