Busy people can't always hike, but getting away for a few hours close to home is always fun. This is a hiker's meetup that the weather will not affect.
It will only cost you the price of your meal.</why><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201647919000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup at CJ's Great West Grill Manchester  </name><id>7223703</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208559600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/7223703/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/e/global_3531694.jpeg</photo_url></item>
