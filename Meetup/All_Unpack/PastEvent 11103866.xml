Page. Page's book details Abraham Lincoln's trip through New Hampshire in March 1860. It provides a wealth of information and insight on Lincoln's visits to Concord, Manchester, Exeter and Dover. Lincoln gave important speeches at each of these towns, that helped pave the way for him to become the first Republican president of the United States. Mike Pride has updated Page's book with new research, and also wrote an informative introduction. The Millyard Museum's current special exhibit, &amp;quot;Abraham Lincoln: Manchester Remembers&amp;quot; chronicles Lincoln's visit to &lt;br /&gt;this city in 1860.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;11:30 a.m.-12:15 a.m&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Aurore Eaton, Executive Director, will give an introductory tour of the Millyard Museum - from Paleo-Indians to the Segway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;1:30 p.m.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When studying history we often ask ourselves &amp;quot;What if?&amp;quot; Local author Joe Smiga asked himself these questions about current events: &amp;quot;What if Iranian submarines launched missiles at the United States? But this canâ€™t be possible. . .how could this happen? Is the U.S. ready for a counter attack?&amp;quot; Smiga explores this speculative topic in his novel &amp;quot;Behind the Lies,&amp;quot; a thriller focusing on tensions in the Middle East.Join us for a change of pace from &amp;quot;past history&amp;quot; and explore an imagined &amp;quot;future history.&amp;quot; For more information, visit www.joesmiga.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: Visit the Manchester Historic Association website for information on our &amp;quot;Hands on History&amp;quot; Family Programs through December: &lt;a href="http://www.manchesterhistoric.org" target="_blank"&gt;Manchester Historic Association website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Manchester Historic Association</member_name><member_id>10139829</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275143079000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>History fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-History-Network</urlname><id>1505455</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester History Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250180069000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Open House at the Millyard Museum</name><id>11103866</id><headcount>100</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260025200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-History-Network/events/11103866/</event_url></item>
