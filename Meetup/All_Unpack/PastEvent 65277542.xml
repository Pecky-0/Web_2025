&lt;p&gt;Please join us for the must attend culinary event of the year in Portsmouth. The &lt;strong&gt;Taste of the Nation Portsmouth&lt;/strong&gt; 2012 promises to be better than ever with over 70 restaurants, craft brewers, wine and other gourmet vendors creating and presenting their finest for your enjoyment. The event will be held on June 27, 2012 under spectacular tents at The Strawbery Banke Museum, and will include live music - as well as a fabulous silent auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;MUST&lt;/strong&gt; buy your tickets in advance, this event sells out quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your entry ticket entitles you to as much as you can eat or drink.  This is where area chefs show off their skills.  Every dollar of your admission ticket goes to feed hungry children, all the food, beer, wine, and soda is donated free by the participating businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
