&lt;p&gt;Come on out! Have some fun Saturday night at the Breakers Restaurant inside the Ashworth Hotel. If you like, join us early or anytime. Have something to eat or just come and sit and talk. Help us hold some seat and tables. This DJ doesn't mind taking requests. So, bring your dancing shoes! We will be meeting for conversation and dinner at 7:30.  Feel free to come for dinner or just for dancing. We just can't hold any seats or tables without you there to hold them. The DJ starts playing at 9:00 and runs until 1:00. There will be people from other groups joining us as well. We usually sit all the way to the back of the room to the left of the dance floor or as close to there as possible! We'll have signs on the table. Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look 4 the Meetup signs on our tables</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352640398000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352211550000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dance / Dinner by the Sea</name><id>90200032</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352593800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/90200032/</event_url></item>
