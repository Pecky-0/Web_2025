Well, during the regular season that's true  -- but as it's cold outside we decided to hook up with the BPL and go inside this month. &lt;br /&gt;Join us on a tour of a masterpiece of American architecture -- the wonderful main (Copley) branch of the Boston Public Library.  The tour will discuss the architecture of this temple built by McKim, Mead and White as well as the amazing art adorning the interior of this &amp;quot;palace of the people.&amp;quot;  Lions and murals and sculpture, oh my!  And as the front of the building says it's &amp;quot;Free To All.&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;Guides will start from the Dartmouth St lobby (that's the entrance facing Copley Square).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet the guides inside the Dartmouth Street lobby - they'll have nametags on.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Coppeto</member_name><member_id>7594176</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gretchen G</member_name><member_id>7594534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1234727350000</updated><rating><average>4.92000007629</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231468748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art and Architecture tour of the Boston Public Library</name><id>9482014</id><headcount>41</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232906400000</time><rsvp_limit>80</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/9482014/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/e/global_6870574.jpeg</photo_url></item>
