Remember the overweight, slightly sweaty lady with the hair net?Remember the trays and the mystery meat?   &lt;br /&gt;Stop remembering and start cooking.... your homework is to pick a dish you remember from that long line in front of the glass sneeze protector and as Emeril says -- &amp;quot;kick it up&amp;quot; a few notches.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mac and Cheese has been called (Fritz) and so have fish sticks (Bill) BAM! BAM!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hum while preparing the ingredients plan to cook on site... you know the drill we cook on site and share the recipes as long as your recipe doesn't take more than an hour to prepare. &lt;br /&gt;written in 1907 - the chorus sung ever since...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to do, Nellie Darling,  &lt;br /&gt;Oh, there's nothing to do, you say,  &lt;br /&gt;Let's take a trip  &lt;br /&gt;On the Memory Ship,  &lt;br /&gt;And sail back to the good old days.  &lt;br /&gt;Sail to the old village schoolhouse,  &lt;br /&gt;Anchor outside the school door,  &lt;br /&gt;Look in and see,  &lt;br /&gt;There's you and there's me,  &lt;br /&gt;A couple of kids once more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School days, school days,  &lt;br /&gt;Dear old golden rule days.  &lt;br /&gt;'Readin' and 'ritin' and 'rithmetic,  &lt;br /&gt;Taught to the tune of a hick'ry stick.  &lt;br /&gt;You were my queen in calico,  &lt;br /&gt;I was your bashful barefoot beau,  &lt;br /&gt;And you wrote on my slate,  &lt;br /&gt;'I love you, Joe,'  &lt;br /&gt;When we were a couple of kids.  &lt;br /&gt;'Member the hill, Nellie Darling,  &lt;br /&gt;And the oak tree that grew on its brow?  &lt;br /&gt;They've built forty stories  &lt;br /&gt;Upon that old hill,  &lt;br /&gt;And the oak's an old chestnut now.  &lt;br /&gt;'Member the meadows so green, dear,  &lt;br /&gt;So fragrant with clover and maize,  &lt;br /&gt;Into new city lots  &lt;br /&gt;And apartment block plots,  &lt;br /&gt;They've torn them up since those days.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>School Daze</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223242102000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218240286000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes September Meetup</name><id>8506832</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221260400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/8506832/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/5/3/global_5086179.jpeg</photo_url></item>
