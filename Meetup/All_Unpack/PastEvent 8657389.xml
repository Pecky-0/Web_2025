We are rescheduling for Thursday evening, September 25, 7pm, same place. I hope everyone who answered “yes” to the original date will be able to make it on the 25th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has heard about left brain, right brain. But what happens when the left side, the thinking side, goes on vacation and the right side takes over? A neuroscientist from Harvard, experienced just that when she had a stroke. She described the experience as total consciousness, nirvana. A stroke is a big price to pay for bliss; there are easier ways to get there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Thursday evening, Matthew Raider, MD, will discuss what happened during her stroke, and how mystics throughout the ages have reached states of pure consciousness without any physical trauma. He will also teach a simple meditation technique that can show you how you can have the same experience of true consciousness that they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more information: newenginfo@sos.org; www.newengsos.org.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy Glassman</member_name><member_id>6837888</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mardi Hughes</member_name><member_id>6839044</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224339905000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-582</urlname><id>1082356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2300033569</group_lon><name>The Science of Spirituality Meditation Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220198821000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adventures in Consciousness: The Trip of a Lifetime </name><id>8657389</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222383600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-582/events/8657389/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/4/global_4303812.jpeg</photo_url></item>
