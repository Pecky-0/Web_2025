This is one of our favorite walking locations. We will be meeting on the Braintree side of PMP at the top of the path where the Bike Path Rules are posted immediately next to the parking lot next to the map and ranger station. What a great way to start the last week of the month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Please Note: There are only two entrances to PMP - in Braintree and Weymouth. There is only one place to meet on the path and that's where the Braintree and Weymouth paths converge. If we walk against the flow of traffic and you will be more than 10 minutes late you could potentially meet us at the merge as we will wait 5-10 minutes for late (Yes RSVP) arrivals, and within 5-10 minutes of our departure we will pass the convergence of the paths. However, if we walk the right way we won't pass that point until almost 1/2 hour into our walk.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loop is 1.6 miles, with the walk to and from the parking lot it is 1.9 miles. It takes about 35-40 minutes to walk the loop. If we walk the loop twice then it's 3.5 miles total and takes a little over an hour to about 1 hr and 15 minutes, depending on pace. If we walk the loop once and walk to the street on the Weymouth entrance it adds .4 miles and about 8-10 minutes total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this time is too early/late for you and you would like to walk PMP please note it in your RSVP so we may note your feedback for scheduling future walks and events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday Evening Walk @ Pond Meadow Park &lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, October 26th, 2010 @ 5:00pm &lt;br /&gt;Pond Meadow Park &lt;br /&gt;470 Liberty Street, Braintree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fee: None, however, there are donation cans which we used to contribute part of the event fees to every 3 or 4 events. If you've been here a bunch of times please consider making a small donation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer(s): Alison &amp;amp; Angela &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: At least 2 Yes RSVPs by 8pm on Monday October 25th. Attendance is unlimited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by 3 PM on Tuesday, October 26th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel. We will walk if it is overcast or there is a slight drizzle. Please plan to bring a lightweight jacket with a hood just in case. (I will do my best to notify everyone if this event is cancelled by 4 pm on the day of the walk.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Best directions should be taken from mapquest.com or maps.google.com. Located on Liberty Street, 500 feet from the intersection of Liberty and Middle Street near the Route 3 overpass directly across from Zana Park Drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note there is a rotary now instead of a regular intersection just before PMP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Route 3: Take Exit 17/Union St., Braintree. Exit on the side of the (Sunoco) Gas Station and Police Station. Follow Union Street to the first set of lights. Take a Right at the lights onto Middle Street. Follow about 1 mile to a Rotary. Go 3/4 of the way around the Rotary and exit onto Liberty Street. (This used to be a regular intersection where you took a left.) PMP is 500 feet up on the Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet near the start of the path in front of the ranger's station.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288215639000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287938953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk at Pond Meadow Park</name><id>15211194</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288126800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/15211194/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/4/global_17172772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
