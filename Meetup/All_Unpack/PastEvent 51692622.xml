Bring signs, bring cameras, bring friends and families. Let's take a stand for what's right, and stand up for Jessica Ahlquist. Last time we had nearly 100 people come out. This time we can double that easy. _ _ See a video with Ellery Schempp and Jessica Ahlquist speaking at the last school committee meeting, at &lt;a href="http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/01/two-sides-face.html" class="linkified"&gt;http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/01/two-sides-face.html&lt;/a&gt;. _ _ PS: If you're coming from Boston, but don't want to drive, I can tell you that there is a commuter train leaving from South Station at 4:35, which will arrive in Providence at 5:42. There are cabs right at the terminal that can take you to the meeting, a distance of about seven miles. _ _ If you encounter any trouble or get lost, call me at 617-935-4951.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329489163000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328800307000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Support the Constitution at the Cranston School Committee Meeting</name><id>51692622</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329433200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/51692622/</event_url></item>
