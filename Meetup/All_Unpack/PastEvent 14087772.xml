Due to the large size I had to find a restaurant that would agree to accommodate us.  We will now be eating dinner at RiRa.  Dinner is still at 7:30, and the reservation is still under my name.  (Stephanie)  If you have not already RSVP'd for dinner, then we will see you outside of RiRa at 8:30 and then we can all walk under the bridge to WaterFire together.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us as the Collective goes to WaterFire. If you've been meaning to go to WaterFire and haven't made it yet, this is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WaterFire is your chance to see Providence at it's most beautiful, illuminated by flickering firelight.  There are street performers, food vendors, and impromptu beer and wine bars set up outside for the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting beforehand at RiRa at 7:30 for a bite and a drink.  Then, at 8:30 we will head over to WaterFire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(When you RSVP for this meetup, please also let me know if you'd like to be part of the reservation for RiRa's for 7:30, or if you will just meet us outside of RiRa's at 8:30.  I will be making the reservation on Friday, so &lt;b&gt;only people RSVPing for RiRa's by midnight on Thursday will be included.&lt;/b&gt;  Everyone else is welcome to meet us at 8:30 outside RiRa's.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your friends!  We look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. After we have had our fill of WaterFire, we will probably make our way to another one of Providence's fine drinking establishments, but that will be casual and unscheduled.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephanie</member_name><member_id>8926850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279593739000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279027039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Location change for WaterFire this Saturday!</name><id>14087772</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279409400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/14087772/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/c/global_16405340.jpeg</photo_url></item>
