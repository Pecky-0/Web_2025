This month we are meeting at The Joshua Tree in Davis Square. (Unlike at the previous meetup, live music doesn't begin until 9:30.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- How about the upcoming special Senate election? &lt;br /&gt;

 - Politics not your thing and just want to hang out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, come on out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monthly meetup is a casual gathering to give us MA Republicans/Conservatives/Libertarians/etc (anything on the right!) an opportunity to meet one another. The recent crowds have included a great mix of long-time members and first-time attendees, men and women of all ages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come whenever you can (we're usually there for a few hours) for a drink or dinner, or simply for the conversation. As always, there's NO AGENDA, so feel free to talk politics, current events, jobs, sports, vacation plans, movies...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First timers are always welcome! Feel free to walk right in and introduce yourself to someone. Worried about how to find us? Call or text my cell: (617) 784-7764.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you can make it! Bring your friends!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick</member_name><member_id>472135</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358305550000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Republicans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>republican-94</urlname><id>131129</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Republican Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356836238000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Republican January Meetup</name><id>97023172</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358294400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/republican-94/events/97023172/</event_url></item>
