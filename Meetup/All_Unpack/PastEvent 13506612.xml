I invite AA/A-level play on my net, optionally coed reverse. If three others tell me they want to start even earlier, I can do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen as many as ten nets set up concurrently at The River, but I have no advance-knowledge or control over who else might set up nets or what they do with them. I do cap my net at 4 to 6 players total. Your best bet is to show up on time. The sun will set at 8:05.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>On the grass between Soldiers Field Road and the Charles River</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt BenDaniel</member_name><member_id>1878223</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274443913000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274102391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grass Doubles at The River</name><id>13506612</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274388300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/13506612/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/3/global_1997523.jpeg</photo_url></item>
