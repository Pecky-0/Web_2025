Feel free to bring the family! (I saw disposable digital cameras at CVS the other day ... what better way to show your kids your love for photography.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email me with questions or suggestions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, Eileen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.butterflyplace-ma.com/"&gt;http://www.butterflyp...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Butterfly Place is an indoor living environment which has been carefully designed for the propagation and development of some of nature?s most colorful living creations. This wonderful man-made habitat is contained within a 3,100 sq. ft. glass atrium building towering to a height of over 27 ft. at its peak. Within this atrium?s living butterfly environment can be found a variety of colorful plants and shrubs, each of which has been selected as a source of nectar for the butterflies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any given time, the atrium may contain up to 500 butterflies representing as many as 50 different species from around the world, although butterflies which are native to the New England region are featured whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Butterfly Place offers a truly unique opportunity to photograph or videotape butterflies in a natural environment.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176445522000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172167509000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Group Shoot: The Butterfly Place</name><id>5504456</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175958000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/5504456/</event_url></item>
