It costs $5 to get in, so carpooling is advised. Dogs must be kept on a leash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the TTOR website:&lt;br /&gt;At Crane Beach, youâ€™ll enjoy one of the finest beaches and outdoor recreation destinations on the East Coast. With its clean, inviting water, miles of shoreline, and mesmerizing views, Crane Beach has been a favorite with the ocean-loving public for generations.  5.5 miles of trails traverse dunes and track the beachfront on both the Ipswich Bay and Essex River Estuary sides of the Castle Neck peninsula.  Moderate hiking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we'll see a snowy owl??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the parking lot pretty promptly at 11 am. I'm in a red Subaru and am driving from Marblehead..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm asking for $1 pp to participate to help recoup organizer fees. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Red subaru with kayak holders on top in parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265731519000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265250639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crane Beach on Sunday</name><id>12513836</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265558400000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/12513836/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/b/global_12937243.jpeg</photo_url></item>
