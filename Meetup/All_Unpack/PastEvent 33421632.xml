&lt;p&gt;Join GWH member and Concord tour guide, Kara Wilson, for a walking tour of Concord on Sunday, October 30 at 1:00pm. Concord is famous as the birthplace of two revolutions: the first for independence from British rule and the second for independent thinking through the Transcendentalist movement. We visit the sites of Concord that played a role in these revolutions, including the Old North Bridge, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, and the site of the Concord Jail. We will meet outside the Concord Visitor Center at 58 Main Street in downtown Concord, next to the Middlesex Savings Bank.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris Lackey</member_name><member_id>7618967</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320053190000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315945342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CANCELLED :: Humanist Excursion: One Town, Two Revolutions: Concord, MA</name><id>33421632</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319994000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/33421632/</event_url></item>
