What a band! &lt;br /&gt;Now, they will be playing at POINT BREEZE on Webster Lake. a great setting for a Friday evening! &lt;br /&gt;www.roomfulcom&lt;br /&gt;www.pointbreezeonwebsterlake.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;This&lt;/b&gt; band has always been one of the tightest, most joyful blues ensembles in the world. Currently an eight-piece unit led by guitarist Chris Vachon, the band has never sounded fresher or stronger. In 2007, singer Dave Howard took over the vocal duties, bringing his gritty and soulful vocals and adding another bright new dimension to the jazzy, jump-blues musical roots. Their winning combination of jump, swing, blues, R&amp;amp;B and soul remains their calling card. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: $15.00 cover &lt;br /&gt;( they will be playing in the lake View Room. there will be dancing) &lt;br /&gt;TIME: 7:30 pm , if you want to come for early drinks and a bit to eat &lt;br /&gt;SHOWTIME: 9:30pm - midnight &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;* NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;For anyone who may want to have drinks/dinner or just a bite?
