Some times we just need others to listen, and just have a good old fashion dialog about life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its all about making friends &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a Friend? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend is one of the nicest things you can have, and one of the best things you can be. &lt;br /&gt;A friend is a living treasure, and if you have one, you have one of the most valuable gifts in life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend is the one who will always be beside you, through all the laughter and each and every tear.  &lt;br /&gt;A friend is the one thing you can always rely on; the someone you can always open up to; &lt;br /&gt;the wonderful person who always believes in you in a way that no else seems to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend is a sanctuary. &lt;br /&gt;A friend is a smile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend is a hand that is always holding yours, no matter where you are, no matter how close or far apart you may be.  &lt;br /&gt;A friend is someone who is always there and will always-always-care. A friend is a feeling of forever in the heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend is the one door that is always open.  &lt;br /&gt;A friend is the one to whom you can give your key. &lt;br /&gt;A friend is one of the nicest things you can have, and one of the best things you can be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poem &amp;quot;What is a Friend&amp;quot; is by Colin McCarty and can be found in the Blue Mountain Arts Collection &amp;quot;The Best Thing in life is a Friend&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;FROM- Route # 84 East and West: &lt;br /&gt;Take Exit #41, South Main Street, going West, take a right off the ramp and going East, take a left...proceed North on Main Street 1.9 miles to Farmington Avenue (grassy knoll on left, white Congregational church on right) take left with left turn signal and go 1.5 city blocks-The Elbow Room, 986 Farmington Avenue, is on the right (and LaSalle Avenue is on the left...it dead ends at The Elbow Room)...proceed clockwise around the building and park in rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM-Route # 91 North and South and downtown Hartford: &lt;br /&gt;Take Route #84 West and follow directions above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM-Farmington: &lt;br /&gt;Take Route #84 East (above) or Farmington Avenue East (toward Hartford)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM-Bloomfield: &lt;br /&gt;Take Cottage Grove Road (West) and this becomes North Main Street entering West Hartford (by CIGNA complex).
