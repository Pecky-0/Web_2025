<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Middlesex will be off the hook this Saturday!  Come out and experience why we are one of the best meetup groups in Boston!  All members are welcome!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;**If the RSVP is full, please sign up on the wait list.  RSVPs are not final until the day of the event, and I will be opening up more spots as the event date approaches**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are returning to Middlesex Lounge in Cambridge after a very long hiatus - this will be a great opportunity to meet new people and get your groove on!  Middlesex has been a premiere spot in Boston since its opening, and it is known for great music and a great crowd.  &lt;b&gt;I expect a big turnout, so RSVPs will fill up quickly - don't miss it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE:  &lt;b&gt;I cannot emphasize enough the importance of going EARLY to Middlesex Lounge&lt;/b&gt;.  Its status as a premiere lounge in Cambridge means the lines can become very difficult.  I recommend getting there by 10pm.  Going early avoids the line drama, and you have more time to talk with nightlife members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8:30pm at Middlesex Lounge, which is located at 315 Massachusetts Ave in Central Square.  &lt;b&gt;I encourage everyone to arrive early to have time to meet people, as the venue will get louder and more crowded as the night progresses.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Please look for me to find the group&lt;/span&gt;.  Cover: $5 after 9pm, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. &lt;b&gt;For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please dress appropriately as this is an upscale venue.&lt;/b&gt;  If traveling by T, Central Square the closest T stop on the red line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!
