<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The day after Thanksgiving is the best day for a pot luck.  Everyone who celebrates it cooks too much of something. So bring your leftovers if you have them or something else if you don't (we can always use drinks, snacks and more games).  Just make sure to bring yourself; someone has to eat all of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner time will be somewhere around 5-7, but snacks and deserts will be eaten all day (you have to be relatively early to get any of my apple cobbler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Games will be provided but feel free to bring your favorites (or that one you never got to play). We have all day and the next so you can even bring those longer games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have comfortable table space for 12-16, but only comfortable chairs for about 10.  Feel free to call me about the chair status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subway: I live on the &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; line between the Chiswick Road Station and the Sutherland Street Station (3-5 min walk from either). Easy 10-15 min walk from both the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; Cleveland Circle Station and the &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; Reservoir Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving: The closest parking is unfortunately resident only, but there is plenty only a 3-5 min walk away on Comm Ave. For backup try Wallingford. You can swing by my place to drop things off and pick me up to help you find a place if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you would like more specifics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben 617-997-3545&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have a gas stove/oven, a crockpot, a smallish microwave, and a fondue pot if you want to bring anything that needs heating up. Just give me a call to make arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Warmus</member_name><member_id>5401423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259594730000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254152940000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Legendary Leftover Pot Luck at Ben's</name><id>11487212</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259344800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/11487212/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
