We now have room for&amp;nbsp;twelve players.***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tee times beginning at 10:30am for Sunday morning&amp;nbsp;at Breakfast Hill Golf Club. I've heard great things about this place and have been wanting to try it for a while. Greens fee is $69 and includes cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposed to be a beautiful course with nice clubhouse. Located straight up route 95N in&amp;nbsp;New Hampshire&amp;nbsp;(probably around 50 mins to an hour from Boston depending where you're at) but supposed to be worth the drive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast Hill Golf Club sits on a piece of land which has been family owned for over two centuries.&amp;nbsp; In 1997, plans were made to build an upscale, public golf course.&amp;nbsp; Once serving as working New Hampshire farmland until 1956, a long-lived dream became a reality when a championship 18-hole layout was completed on June 30, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quaintly nestled under our trademark soaring pines sits an upscale public golf course still premature in age yet in its prime amongst the area&amp;rsquo;s best layouts.&amp;nbsp; Breakfast Hill Golf Club invites you to experience a true New England golf experience unlike any other.&amp;nbsp; Designed by renowned golf course architect Brian Silva, Breakfast Hill rests on 170 acres of family owned land dating back over 250 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our championship par 71 layout has consistently been ranked a top five course by Golf Week magazine as one of America&amp;rsquo;s best daily fee facilities.&amp;nbsp; As recently as 2008, Golf Digest awardedBreakfast Hill four stars as one of their Best Places to Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice facility is one of the most all-inclusive in the area.&amp;nbsp; Every aspect of one&amp;rsquo;s precision can be tested and enhanced.&amp;nbsp; The driving range includes four target greens with varying distances.&amp;nbsp; Included in our practice facilities, a sprawling 10,000 square foot putting green, a favorite destination for practice or play, can boost one&amp;rsquo;s short game to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
