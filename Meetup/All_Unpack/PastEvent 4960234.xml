<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Linda Hamel (General Counsel) and Tim Vaverchak (Director, Open Source Strategy) from the Commonwealth's Information Technology Division (ITD) will conduct a two part presentation on July 10th:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. How is the Commonwealth using PHP and other open source software - where, why and by whom. With a consuming public looking for more information, easier, faster and better the Commonwealth is looking to produce highly stable, highly functional product/services in an infinite number of areas while operating within a very finite budget. Sounds like the job for open source...come learn what the Commonwealth is expecting out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Service procurement process at the Commonwealth - Ever wondered how to do business with the State? Which door(s) to knock on? Where to hear about the next requirement(s). The &amp;quot;big consulting&amp;quot; folks know all about it...now it's the OSS community's chance. Come listen, ask questions and perhaps uncover some new opportunities for you and your services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, after any healthy technical discussion food &amp;amp; drink must follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.BostonPHP....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1149205058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston PHP Meetup July Meetup</name><id>4960234</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1152570600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/4960234/</event_url></item>
