Based on the 1967 film of the same name, Thoroughly Modern Millie tells the story of a small-town girl, Millie Dillmount, who comes to New York City to marry for money instead of love â€“ a thoroughly modern aim in 1922, when women were just entering the workforce. Millie soon begins to take to delight in the flapper lifestyle, but problems arise when she checks into a hotel owned by the leader of a white slavery ring in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GVVpzTNEpA" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in lobby near the door, I will have small Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271114381000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268011078000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thoroughly Modern Millie - Pawtucket Comm.
