This has worked well in the past as it T-accessible from both the red and green lines and also has a car park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Trader Joes is located right across the street which stocks beer and wine - so for those of you who are coming by public transport this makes it easy to pick up your food/beer and wine and not have to lug it with you. There is also a whole foods just a couple of streets away. The set-up that has worked well for us in the past is everybody being responsible for their own meat and booze and then we usually share condiments/salads etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP if you could indicate whether it is possible for you to bring a portable BBQ , esky, cricket set etc (or vodka soaked watermelon! Hint Hint KC) - that will help with the planning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on arriving a little bit early to stake out a picnic table and a nice shady area and get things set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a family suitable event - so people with kids please feel free to bring them along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not had any problems drinking at the park in the past, but just to be safe we have used plastic cups in the past.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kendall</member_name><member_id>3686199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280681042000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279054800000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Australia Day in July - Boston</name><id>14092658</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280592000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/14092658/</event_url></item>
