During his tenure at the New York Times, Grundberg's critical writing helped establish a general understanding of contemporary photography. His book, Crisis of the Real: Writing on Photography, 1974-1989, is a venerated text outlining the complex nature of photography as it entered the postmodern era. As an author he has also lent his considerable insight to countless artist monographs and exhibition catalogues. As former director of The Friends of Photography in San Francisco and a freelance curator, Grundberg has also curated many highly acclaimed exhibitions. He is currently the Administrative Chair of Photography at the Corcoran College of Art + Design, and has previously taught at institutions such as Dartmouth College, the San Francisco Art Institute, the School of Visual Arts, and the University of Maryland.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206227054000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204471864000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Collecting Photographs, Collecting the World"</name><id>7445613</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206054000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/7445613/</event_url></item>
