This status allows the MassLPA Inc. to raise funds and hold events. We are also in the process of upgrading our website to create an interactive venue for visitors that are searching for or contributing current information on local, state, regional and national issues and a calendar of action events. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Agenda&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itinerary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Item 1) 12:00 – 1:00:  Meet &amp;amp; Greet with refreshments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(a)    Sign in.&lt;br /&gt;(b)   Introductions.&lt;br /&gt;(c)    Convention debriefing. &lt;br /&gt;(d)   Misc.
