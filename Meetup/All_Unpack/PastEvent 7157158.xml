Many of the 100+ artists open their studios to the general public.  You'll want to walk around and see the other photographers' studios and marvel at all the equipment and cool photographs.  Come by my studio which I share with Jeff Engel and see more cool equipment.  Bring your camera so you can go home with your headshot for your meetup profile. Thanks to Jason Moore for suggesting this idea.  The open studios run 12-5 PM every first Saturday of the month. Come by any time between 12-5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the location, we can add this to the list of studio locations available for meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are also here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://westernavenuestudios.com/directions02.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://westernavenuestudios.com/directions02.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://westernavenues...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>2nd Floor A-Mill.
