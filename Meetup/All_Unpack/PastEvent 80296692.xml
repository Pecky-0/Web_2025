<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We would like everyone to bring a main dish from their native country or a country that interests them.  This will be like a "Pot Luck Dinner"  Also if you have a folding chair that you can bring it would be helpful as we need some extra seating.  If there is a dish from your native country that you would like to bring or just a dish that you like to make.  If every attendee brings something there should be enough for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we eat I would like everyone to come prepared to speak in Spanish about the dish they brought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions you can call Kurt @ 860-978-051&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>As you come in the Main drive way there is a club house on the right with parking.
