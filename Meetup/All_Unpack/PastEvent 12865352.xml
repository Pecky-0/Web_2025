That will give the morning group plenty of time, so we won't crowd them and fill up the parking lot. I agree that 20 the best number.  I have been to this park several times and it is a great walk.  We will walk about 2 1/2 hours.  Some of it will be uphill.  Since it is &amp;quot;mud season&amp;quot; in New England waterproof shoes might be best.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are allowed off leash once on the trail. dog bags are provided at the entrance,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Rt. 128 Exit 14, take Rt. 133 East toward Gloucester for 3 mi. until it ends at Rt. 127. Turn right and follow for 2 mi. to entrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/u&gt; Explore a shrouded landscape of hemlock groves, a magnolia swamp, and other trees species where you’ll find remnants of Colonial habitation. You don’t want to miss trekking to the overlook to Gloucester Harbor or traversing the boardwalk through the Great Magnolia Swamp, home to native sweetbay magnolias (Magnolia virginiana).  There is also the Ledge Hill Trail a 2-mile round-trip walk among magical-looking, fern-covered boulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----As a condition of attending this meetup you agree to release,hold harmless,and indemnify the organizer(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage,injury,illness and or death,including those caused by negligence and or other reasons.You also agree to assume all risk associated with this meetup and agree to know and follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Silver Honda Fit</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joan C</member_name><member_id>5518283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269278296000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268482637000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Second Ravenswood in The Afternoon</name><id>12865352</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269104400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/12865352/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/3/global_13612691.jpeg</photo_url></item>
