I have a new women's dog site now. This is West Of Boston Over 40 Women's Doggie Meet-Up. You can find this site by clicking on my profile and schrolling down my meet-ups until you see my dog site. Then click and join up! I love dogs so make sure you put a pic. in and tell us all about your favorite child. My cute dogs are just puppies in the pic. are turning 8. I also own a carin terrier. My 1st meet-up will be on Sat. 21 Mar. weather permitting and we will decide how to proceed from there. I like dog hikes myself and am looking for great places to run the kids. I run a dog business also and have a large fenced yard with pea stone for you out there who are local and just want to hang out in the yard. I just ask that all dogs be non-aggresive and semi-well-behaved....updated on all vaccinations. This group should be alot of fun.
