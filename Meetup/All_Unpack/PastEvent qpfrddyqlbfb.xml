<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;A traditional way to read through "Finnegans Wake" -- James Joyce's phantasmagorical multilingual polystrated hypnagogic Meisterwerk, about the folly of life and love and the falling down and rising up again of lives and civilizations -- is in a group where the various specialties of the participants can all be brought to bear on this notoriously knotty text. There are several such groups which meet regularly in the Boston area; and one meets weekly at O'Leary's Pub. Since this happening has a decidedly literary theme, it makes sense to alert members of the BP group to the opportunity to join in. If you'd like to even attend a session, contact me at zakbos @ gmail.com and I'll be sure to save you seat. Or, join the Boston Finneganers Google Group, at &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/boston-finneganers" class="linkified"&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/boston-finneganers&lt;/a&gt;, and stay involved with whatever online chat is happening through that mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually runs for 1-2 hours, starting at 5, 5:30, or 6; checking the Google Group for the most up-to-date schedule information. Warning: the conversation can grow VERY discursive. And tends often to be blue; but then, that's one of the joys of Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344036471000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343516089000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Finnegans Fridays</name><id>qpfrddyqlbfb</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>6300000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344029400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/75323542/</event_url></item>
