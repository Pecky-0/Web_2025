Their description is as follows: &amp;quot;Moderate walk, 3 miles. Sawcut Notch path to Indian Camp Path and return via Old Furnace Brook Path. Meet at Shea Rink parking lot at 651 Willard Street in Quicny.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Memorial Rink: 651 Willard St Quincy MA 02169 (617) 472-9325 From Route 93: Take Exit 8 (Willard Street). Bear right off exit. Follow approximately 1/2 mile, rink is on right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rink is right on the border of the Blue Hills reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first walk we did with them was an easy 2 miles and we had to head out on our own afterwards to fill up our 2 hour quota, so this should be about right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we can go for lunch at Pho So 1&lt;br /&gt;51 Memorial Pkwy (Cross Street: Route 139)&lt;br /&gt;Randolph, MA 02368&lt;br /&gt;(781) 961-6500 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a ride say so on your rsvp, along with what area you live in.  If you don't get one that way, I can pick you up at the Forest Hills station at 12:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171899120000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169189131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue Hills walk</name><id>5407191</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170525600000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5407191/</event_url></item>
