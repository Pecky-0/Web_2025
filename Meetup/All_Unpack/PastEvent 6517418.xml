Please accept my apologies for not organizing something more recently...my travel schedule has been really hectic.  I owe a couple of you e-mail responses, and I do thank you for your suggestions.  One person has asked for a Sunday brunch, which sounds like a great idea...I'm going to be out the next couple of Sundays, but I'll try to put something together for that when I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup, however, is an attempt to try to bring some people together this week.  We'll meet this Thursday at Clery's Bar &amp;amp; Restaurant in the Back Bay, one block south of the Back Bay T/train station, at the intersection of Dartmouth &amp;amp; Columbus.  I don't want to do Friday due to the madness that will surely surround the Red Sox game.  So please RSVP if you can make it, and I hope to meet many of you!  As always, if you have questions, feel free to e-mail me...I promise to respond when I can :-).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian B.</member_name><member_id>4457375</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542344000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Midwesterners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Midwesterners</urlname><id>545362</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ex-Midwesterners Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191937568000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner &amp; drinks in Back Bay</name><id>6517418</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192143600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Midwesterners/events/6517418/</event_url></item>
