<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a closed-door, members-only meeting. Those who have not paid dues and have not signed a statement of non-disclosure cannot attend this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tentatively scheduled two of our members to present at this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it will be a long time since we had a members-only meeting, and due to the new members who have joined us, we will make this event a little more social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will do introductions around the room, and every member can briefly summarize what kind of help they need and for what problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may also set up round tables by experience, product, or service needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Kat.</member_name><member_id>8999115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357230143000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349141214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Closed-door, members-only January meeting</name><id>85049452</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357169400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/85049452/</event_url></item>
