Experienced paddlers are welcomed and would inspire and teach the beginners..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few of The Massachusetts Kayak Group will most likely join us also, dont know, if not then they should get to practice themselves or g0 for instruction at some sport shop..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an event where YOU will get wet practicing a few self rescue techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU THINK YOU ARE SAFE AND NEVER GONNA FALL IN, GOOD, BUT WHAT YOU GONNA DO IF YOU ARE OUT A MILE OR SO ON THE OCEAN IN WAVES AND NEVER DID A SELF RESCUE,&lt;br /&gt;YOU GONNA DIE IF YOU CANT GET BACK IN..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we paddle around the lake and see whats new on the lake.. a pretty simple ..a Get in shape thing for the next one. (4 MILE RIVER OUT TO SOME ISLANDS OR MAYBE EVEN THE THIMBALL ISLANDS, HAVENT CHOSEN YET)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is to socialize on the beach and water, try out each others kayaks to see what might be a better fit to us..etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting there:&lt;br /&gt;There is a easy to reach boat launch right off of rte 44 in Bolton that has plenty of parking and PortoPotties at the parking lot (they should be there by then if not , Pee in the water..LOL). Further to the east on the lake is a beach area that would be an excellent place to sit in the sun eat some snacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: to the boat launch.&lt;br /&gt;Rte 384 heading East to Bolton Notch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continue on Rte 44 E (left part of fork) ...rte 6 is to the right&lt;br /&gt;There is a traffic light with a post office and a small shopping area to the right, continue to the next light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next light has the boat launch to the left and a church to the right. (South street intersection)&lt;br /&gt;Enter the boat launch area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then its a BARBIE-Q NEARBY,&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Bolton Notch Pond area since its nice and secluded BUT depending on the number of people and weather, i may choose a different location nearby just as good but with better parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Bolton Notch for the Picknick:&lt;br /&gt;From the boat launch area , take a right and go to the tarffic light at the intersection of Quarry road and across from the Post Office and Bug Juice store ?..&lt;br /&gt;From this intersection its exactly 0.4 miles to the entrance to the rails to trails parking lot. There are no signs.. (i will most likely put a orange stryped tarffic cone there if i can)&lt;br /&gt;its really easy to miss this entrance and its angled in a hard to see way..so be on the lookout for it. its before you see the pond..&lt;br /&gt;enter the drive way, bear left past the parking area and go down the dirt road around the pond..i will be easy to spot..LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use apx between 398 and 400 Boston Turnpike, Bolton to get you close..this isnt really a good GPS address place but for a general graphic reference for a map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Nature preserve:&lt;br /&gt;Get onto rte 44 and head toward West, get onto rte 384 to exit # 4 (Highland Park &amp;amp; Highland St) take a left at end of exit, take first right onto Autumn st, then first right onto Oak Grove, driveway for Oak Grove Nature center is on right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe even another location if its slightly rainy that has a Pavillion. we will make the final decision the day of and during the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the event details as the time gets closer.. rain ..exact time etc..IF NECESSARY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case of any rain wind or cool cloudy weather, It might be best to wait till a better weekend.&lt;br /&gt;but i will update the last time at 10 am the day of..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be safe and bring your Personal Flotation Devices if you have some, a whistle will let us hear you if ya fall in.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon..&lt;br /&gt;al-r&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the PIMP GOLD Toyota with Kayak Trailer and the Orange striped cone.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AL-r</member_name><member_id>2711041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252169547000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248128808000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak Self Rescue Techniques YOU will perform, &amp; Pot Luck Picknick nearby</name><id>10918782</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250438400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/10918782/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/3/9/global_5044665.jpeg</photo_url></item>
