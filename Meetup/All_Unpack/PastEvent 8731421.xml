The slogan &amp;quot;Drill, Baby, Drill&amp;quot; doesn't really address it.  Even climate change has moved to the background.  This re-emphasizes that we need to start addressing these issues ourselves at the local community level.  One good, creative and encompassing answer can be found in &lt;b&gt;the Transition Town Model which can unleash the collective synergy of your community&lt;/b&gt; to rebuild its local resilience to adversity (e.g. energy shocks or food shortages) in a positive way.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have a chance after the film to talk about Peak Oil, Transition Towns and other positive actions we can take locally.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, we can tackle Peak Oil and Climate Change.&lt;br /&gt;Together, we can choose to create the future for ourselves and our children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alastair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/6nt8q5" target="_blank"&gt;Directions to Zero Station&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the former corporate/academic happy man in blue jeans.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alastair</member_name><member_id>4963124</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222778967000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>TT'rs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>TI-Portland</urlname><id>1233823</id><group_lat>43.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2900009155</group_lon><name>Tohidu Transition - Portland Maine</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221078317000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Film Screening "Crude Awakening"  (85 min)</name><id>8731421</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221778800000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/TI-Portland/events/8731421/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/a/global_4989194.jpeg</photo_url></item>
