Please come out and join us to support our Natives Whitney and Bret who are on the block this year and maybe even bid!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Project Smile for a Red hot and fun evening and bid on a date with Boston's finest and most desirable singles. Project Smile will be auctioning off dates with police officers, firefighters and some of Boston's most eligible guys and ladies during their 3rd Annual Charity Date Auction from 6:30 - 9pm on Friday, September 17.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies need to know that every guy will come with a pair of sexy high heel shoes just for you.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys need to know that every lady will come with a high quality necktie for you.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each couple receives a gift certificate to some of Boston's hottest spots to use on their date - including restaurants, comedy shows, sports tickets and more.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event also includes a silent auction and raffle featuring Spirit Airline tickets, autographed Red Sox, Bruins, and Patriots items, theatre tickets, gift baskets and more.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not single you can still hang out, enjoy the fun and support a great cause. All proceeds benefit Project Smile the non profit organization dedicated to help children  involved in traumatic events.   Over 400 people participated last year.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event also features live music, light appetizers and a full cash bar.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $17.00 in advance.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information and to purchase tickets or sponsor this event go to the Project Smile website.&lt;a href="http://www.projectsmile.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or contact our friend Catherine Pisacaine at cpisacane@projectsmile.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon</member_name><member_id>6918204</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285031934000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268588839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Project Smile 4th Annual Charity Date Auction at Gypsy Bar</name><id>12873702</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284762600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/12873702/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/2/global_9249538.jpeg</photo_url></item>
