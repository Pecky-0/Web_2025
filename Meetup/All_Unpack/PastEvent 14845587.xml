His gallery focuses on emerging contemporary art.  He'll be saying a few words about his gallery and the current exhibit by Brendon O'Connell. Brendon's artwork is very large and colorful paintings. Hope you can make it. It should be very interesting and worth it.  Refreshments will be served by the gallery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will a great opportunity to talk to another knowledable art person and to be part of the Boston Arts scene.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red Line's Broadway Station is the closest Public Transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lamontagnegallery.com/exhibitions.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a small meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Q.</member_name><member_id>2269958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286108005000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285085966000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>LaMontagne Gallery - South Boston</name><id>14845587</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286046000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/14845587/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/8/global_16970120.jpeg</photo_url></item>
