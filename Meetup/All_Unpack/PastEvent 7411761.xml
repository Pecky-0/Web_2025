I think he is back for the St. Patricks climb though! I think the gym has guiness or four leaf clovers at the top that night. ;-) In the meantime ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yo everyone, sign up. We will climb Metro Rock on Mondays. Let's have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to be belay tested if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before - call them. They have a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. Look up Metro Rock's web site - or call them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We meet at the picnic table at 7pm.
