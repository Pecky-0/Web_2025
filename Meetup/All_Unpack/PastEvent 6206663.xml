Casablanca.  If you haven't seen it that really depresses me.  You are missing one of the great films of all time.  Not only do you get to see the lovely Ingrid Bergman, but also Bogart in a very cool and hilarious role.  And lets not forget hearing Sam sing &amp;quot;As Time Goes By&amp;quot; on of the great standards in music history.  As always when I post a classic I like to throw up some quotes.  Hollywood doesn't write them like this anymore and that is ashame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains)&lt;br /&gt;What in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?&lt;br /&gt;Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart)&lt;br /&gt;My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.&lt;br /&gt;Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains)&lt;br /&gt;The waters? What waters? We're in the desert!&lt;br /&gt;Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart)&lt;br /&gt;I was misinformed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;?Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yvonne: Where were you last night?&lt;br /&gt;Rick: That's so long ago I don't remember.&lt;br /&gt;Yvonne: Will I see you tonight?&lt;br /&gt;Rick: I never make plans that far ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details.  I'll be there at 10:30 sipping mimosas.  Movie starts at 11:00.  My guess is it will be busy.  Then again maybe it won't.  Contact is Chris.  203 525-5670.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188918192000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187532883000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>We'll always have Paris</name><id>6206663</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188745200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6206663/</event_url></item>
