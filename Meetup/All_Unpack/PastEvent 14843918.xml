The cost is only $30 inclusive for an extraordinary evening. We are looking to cover the cost for a small intimate evening. Any extra money will go to needy kids art programs at The TSETSE Gallery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;img src="http://thetravelingwheelchair.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/water-fire-providence-047.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start out with a sunset paddle on the Upper Pawtuxet River. We end the paddle at the spectacular River Fires leading onto and up the lawn of a private residence right on the river. It will be a no moon night, so be sure to bring lights for your boat (a flashlight will do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.emubottom.com.au/corporate_social/pics/dinner_under_the_cross.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diner is an intimate affair on that back lawn under the stars, amid the fires to keep us warm inside and out. We will be entertained by professional acoustic guitarist and singer, Mike Harris while we get ready for dinner. The dinner itself will be a sumptuous fall harvest turkey dinner with all the fixings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a paddle you will never forget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Mark Roberts. The Hope RI address will be sent at confirmation of attendance.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286134098000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SNEP-1</urlname><id>1360815</id><group_lat>41.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.1100006104</group_lon><name>Southern New England Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285076858000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stars &amp; Fires Dinner Paddle</name><id>14843918</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286056800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SNEP-1/events/14843918/</event_url></item>
