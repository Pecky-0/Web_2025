A songwriter and producer as well as singer, he is the winner of the Amalia Rodrigues Award for Best Album of 2004 with his ?Luz de Lisboa,? and a highly regarded performer across Europe. He appears with the traditional accompaniment of Portuguese guitar and classical guitar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/artist/heldermoutinhotrio.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/artist/heldermoutinhotrio.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.johnnyds.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eyefortalent.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/artist.detail/artist_id/107" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eyefortalent.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/artist.detail/artist_id/107" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.eyefortale...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There will be a sign saying "Portuguese Meet-Up" at the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216942853000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215396458000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portuguese Fado Music (Helder Moutinho) at Johnny D's</name><id>8289130</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216769400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/8289130/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/global_4704013.jpeg</photo_url></item>
