We are going to do this by doing a “literature drop” in her district.  What this entails is driving throughout the district, and putting flyers into &lt;u&gt;newspaper boxes&lt;/u&gt; (two people per car).  To cover as much of the district as possible, we need as many volunteers as we can get. This is by far the most cost effective way to get the word out.  The flyers have already been funded through donations (&lt;a href="http://www.nhedfreedom.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.nhedfreedom.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet this Sat, 7 Feb, at the Hampton Airfield in North Hampton (see &lt;a href="http://www.hamptonairfield.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hamptonairfield.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hamptonair...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), in the café.  Get there by 9:30am to get a street map of the region you will cover, and the flyers, and you should be out the door by 10am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The content of the flyers is an appeal to the taxpayers of her district, to not take away resources from the public schools.  Also it highlights some of the positive aspects/successes of homeschooling, and the fact that it saves taxpayers money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP to me: &lt;a href="mailto:jimforsythe@metrocast.net" target="_blank"&gt;jimforsythe@metrocast.net&lt;/a&gt;, or 822-2588.  This will allow us to put together the appropriate number of maps.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meet in the cafe</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234190277000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233758379000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pro-Homeschooling Lit Drop:  Lit Drop Rep Day's District</name><id>9671103</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234017000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9671103/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
