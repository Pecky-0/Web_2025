In 1994, Dennis started his own business as a commercial finance broker, helping to pair up small businesses and lenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of common stages where Dennis has been particularly helpful to small businesses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lines of credit for working capital,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short-term loans for expansion and growth, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small to medium businesses in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, Dennis will walk through the stages of the loan process and the characteristics that banks look for in borrowers like a credit review, cash flow, and even the personal character of the borrower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will gain insights into the stages of business growth, and will have the opportunity to ask Dennis questions after the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Use the 100 Milk St. entrance and take the elevator to the 8th Floor.
