Each class is filled with calming, nurturing ways to enhance bonding and improve baby’s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;During a Baby Itsy Bitsy Yoga class, babies enjoy yoga while on their backs, tummies, or held in loving arms. For parents, this class is a special opportunity to meet other parents in the community, and learn about baby's emerging personality. Most of the yoga we do in Itsy Bitsy Yoga is for baby, but you will also learn breathing and relaxation techniques as you practice a bit of yoga yourself. &lt;br /&gt;No yoga experience is required. Thank you for arranging just 1 parent/caregiver per family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;Next Weekend Baby IBY Meetup Time:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, January 15, 1:30-2:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;Cost: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;$15/class (pre-payment required w/ YES RSVP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;About Us: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This Weekend IBY Meetup classes will be taught by Jennifer Mischley, Certified Itsy Bitsy Yoga Facilitator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itsy Bitsy Yoga was created by Helen Garabedian, an Infant Developmental Movement Educator, yoga teacher, and mother.
