It was a cool to see the city in that way. It was also a social run so it was a lot of fun and a good way to get to know other people who enjoy running. Plus you're getting in a good workout in while taking in the city's beautiful urbanscapes. Afterward we might hit a local or go home and shower and head out again later for dinner or drinks... (that was the life :) And... I miss it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also... this particular date is really only to see if there's an interest in doing this sort of thing. If there is, we can always figure out the actual details later. We could always meet up somewhere to talk and plan if there's any real interest in doing this. Thanks.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just off the top... I can think of several places that would be great for group/social runs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Along the beaches and Castle Island in South Boston.&lt;br /&gt;-Along the Charles (Boston and Cambridge)  &lt;br /&gt;-JP Reservoir &lt;br /&gt;-The Arnold Arboretum in JP&lt;br /&gt;-Through the Parks (The Common, Boston Gardens, The Commonwealth Mall and The Fens) &lt;br /&gt;-Minuteman Bike Path&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.... Please let me know if there's any interest in doing this at all. In NYC it worked out really.... well. But here... I am not so sure. We will see. Anyhow, I thought I'd put it out there before I made any assumptions :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240180471000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235168150000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Five Mile Fridays - Depending on the Weather :)</name><id>9786083</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240007400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9786083/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/0/global_7612912.jpeg</photo_url></item>
