&lt;p&gt;Split Decision is a trivia game featuring X-or-Y pairings. You'll be presented with a word or phrase, and you have to decide which it is: A Discontinued Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's Flavor or a Band We Found on MySpace? A Presidential Nickname or a Professional Wrestler? A Celebrity Baby Name or a Computer Virus? A line from Doogie Howser's Diary or a Random Twitter Update?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get it right, fill in a circle on your scoring pad. First person to fill up his or her card wins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed in are Challenge Cards, where you ask one person three straight trivia questions. When you draw one of these cards, you'll be instructed who to challenge -- "Challenge the Person Who's Gotten the Most Speeding Tickets" or "Challenge the Best Person to Cheat Off in Chemistry Class" -- and the questions are related to that theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to, you know, being fun, we think you'll learn a whole lot of cool stuff each time you play. Stuff you'll later wow someone with when you casually drop it into conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
