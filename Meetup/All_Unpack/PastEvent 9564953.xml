You won’t believe the colors and the scents of the Camellia flowers and other flowers and plants in the garden! Your cameras (and you) will be smiling with joy when you capture the colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tower Hill Botanical Garden is a beautiful &amp;amp; peaceful place to spend a Sunday afternoon. Leave the ice, snow and cold weather behind to relax and enjoy the warmth and colors of the indoor garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Massachusetts Camellia Society, one of the oldest societies in the United States, will present the 180th Annual Camellia Show at Tower Hill Botanic Garden. See hundreds of gorgeous Camellia flowers at the peak of their display—both on the Camellia trees themselves as part of Tower Hill’s own collection, and also in bowls of floating blossoms from private collections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can get a bite to eat at the Twigs restaurant that is in the building after the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet inside the entrance of the The Stoddard Education &amp; Visitors Center</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235697143000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232484246000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Click and Shoot Event:180th Annual Camellia Show at Tower Hill Botanic Garden</name><id>9564953</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235322000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/9564953/</event_url></item>
