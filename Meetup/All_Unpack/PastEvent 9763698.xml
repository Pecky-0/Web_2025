It's a little last-minute but, rumor has it, some of my favorite people will be there. So c'mon, let's get out of the house and do some climbing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Afterwards I'm going to this show, it &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; get loud though ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Alternative-Cafe/calendar/9770345/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the picnic table at 7:30</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jonathan</member_name><member_id>2230421</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235437783000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234918117000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday evening climbs</name><id>9763698</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235089800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/9763698/</event_url></item>
