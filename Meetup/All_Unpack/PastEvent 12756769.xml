For anyone who has not yet experienced their work, I highly recommend taking advantage of this free opportunity to drop into sweet connection with yourself and others in a very safe and respectful space. And if you attended previously, you are of course welcome to attend again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover how your beliefs about love, intimacy and sexuality affect your relationships, sexual satisfaction, marriage, body image and ability to find love. Our personal relationship workshops are about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·         Making the right relationship choices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·         Discovering greater depths of intimacy and love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·         Finding love, being honest and creating intimacy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·         Creating the relationships you’ve always wanted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; relationship mini-workshop, you’ll have the opportunity to connect with others through verbal sharing and exercises designed to open your heart. Come and get a taste of what you’ve been craving, in a totally safe, non-sexual environment. The event is free, and the people are wonderful. All that’s missing is you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, April 11, 2-4:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Human Awareness Institute (HAI) welcomes singles, couples, traditional and non-traditional relationships, without regard to sexual choices or preferences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you can so that we can plan appropriately. If you find yourself available at the last minute, call and join us! Contact Brynn at 415-244-1652 or email organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Brynn, I want to thank you again for introducing me to the Human Awareness Institute Workshops.  After attending the mini workshop you hosted last year I felt a closed heart begin to open again (my it felt good).  Since that workshop I've attended two weekend workshops and will be attending a third this April.  I wholeheartedly feel these experiential workshops are some of the best I've ever participated in.  Combining a new loving sense of myself, along with new wonderful friends I've made, I can say my life is richer and will never be the same.&amp;quot; -Ben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>2nd floor, door on the right</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brynn</member_name><member_id>7976948</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271259809000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Passionate Souls</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tantric-Intimacy</urlname><id>1471990</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Tantric Intimacy</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267546742000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Relational Intimacy – An Afternoon Exploration</name><id>12756769</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271008800000</time><rsvp_limit>45</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tantric-Intimacy/events/12756769/</event_url></item>
