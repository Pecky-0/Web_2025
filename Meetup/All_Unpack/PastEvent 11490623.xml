This is one of my favorite restaurant in Astoria, but they have a nice bar/sitting area where we can chat!  &lt;br /&gt;Now the Brick can hold small groups of up to 8-10 people per sitting, so if we have more people RSVP we may have to change the location by Wednesday to Cafe Bar which holds more people. Cafe Bar is located on 34th Ave and 36th street.  &lt;br /&gt;So please RSVP and let me know if  you can make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brickcafe.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/url]it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;Hope to see you Friday!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a name tag on :) Or call me on my cell: (413) 627-3484</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa L.
