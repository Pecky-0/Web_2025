I hear that rain has moved through the area (it isn't raining where I live). I tried the contact number of the Elm Shakespeare Company and no one answered. There is no comment on their site about what they do if it rains. So, I'm still planning to head down to Edgerton and will probably get there around 7 pm.  If it starts raining and the show is canceled, Sunday could still be a rain date.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**8/15 update: Now they are predicting morning thunderstorms. As long as they really stay in the morning, we should still be fine. Check back for updates!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I don't know how crowded these shows get. The one we went to last year was crowded, but the Yale students had also just gotten back in town and it seemed like a lot of orientation/student groups went the same night. We can try to spread out a bit to save some room, but the earlier you can get there, the better for getting space together.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is time again for Shakespeare in the Park (Edgerton Park). Last year we had a great time at &amp;quot;Much Ado about Nothing&amp;quot; and this year's play is another comedy: &amp;quot;As You Like It.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short plot synopsis of &amp;quot;As You Like it&amp;quot; from IMDB:&lt;br /&gt;A duke usurps his brother's land and power, banishing him and his retinue into the forrest of Arden. The banished duke's daughter, Rosalind, remains with her cousin Celia. She has fallen in love with Orlando, but he has his own tyrannical brother to contend with, so he joins those in the forest. Rosalind, now banished, disguises herself as a young man, with Celia as her servant, and follows Orlando into the forest. There, nature stirs love's fires in various rustics as well as in those from the court. Phebe, a shepherdess loved by Silvius, is herself smitten with the disguised Rosalind. Can true love find a way, and can brothers be reconciled and harmony restored?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us at 6:45 for a potluck or at 8 pm for just the play. &lt;br /&gt;Possible post party in downtown New Haven if there is interest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show is at Edgerton Park in New Haven (off of Whitney, near the New Haven/Hamden line). Entrances to the park are on Cliff Street and Edgehill Road and there is parking on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to come early, please mention this in your RSVP so I have an idea of how many people are coming and when. The amount of space we can save depends on how crowded the performance is. Last year it was the night that all the Yale students went, but we are going a few weeks earlier this time so it might be less crowded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to bring: a blanket or lawn chair, bug spray, food or drink (if you want). The event is free, but they suggest a donation of $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much too early to know how the weather is going to be that night. Check back for updates when it gets closer. If it rains, I?ll try to reschedule the event for another night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Andrea 203-641-8083&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.elmshakespeare.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Elm Shakespeare Company Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188314619000</updated><rating><average>4.63000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>36</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185582934000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday 8/17 -- Shakespeare in the Park "As You Like It"</name><id>6087732</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187390700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6087732/</event_url></item>
