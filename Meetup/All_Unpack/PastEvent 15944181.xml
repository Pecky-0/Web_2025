So, you loved, you gave, you cherished and shared everything. You opened your heart and let someone in, sharing your deepest joys and sorrows, daring to let another into your experience; then things changed. They left, or they found someone else, or you did. The grief of a broken heart allows for either new insights to open or a closing down to the flow of life and love ever moving through again. Mother Clare will guide you to keeping your heart open through what can feel like a tremendous task in order to stay connected and real with the people around you. Come, heal your heart and live again. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296869903000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294332948000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Broken Heart with Mother Clare Watts</name><id>15944181</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296865800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/15944181/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/7/global_5804807.jpeg</photo_url></item>
