<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Alright lets try this again......I know this means there is a bunch to choose from this day, but the hiking group should be covering all the desires of those we hike with by having choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bunch will start a little later but since we will not be out there for more than four hours, you have time after for other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is June we may get to enjoy the Mountain Laurel in full bloom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a roughly 6.2 mile looping hike in Peoples State Forest. Some portions will be steep but do-able. Established in 1924, the forest includes over 11 miles of trails as well as the west branch of the Farmington River which was designated as a Wild and Scenic River by the National Park Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet by 11:00 AM at the state forest main parking area on the west side of East River Rd. This paved parking area will be roughly across the street (a little more north) from the main entrance (see the map, the southern gray block near the entrance). We'll start the hike at 11:15 AM.  Be prepared to pay to park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll hike a short distance to the Nature Center and pick up the blue blazed trail on the west side of Greenwoods Rd. We'll follow the Robert Ross Trail north and then get onto the blue w/yellow dot Jesse Gerard Trail and eventually intersect with Greenwoods Rd. again at the northernmost point of this hike. Then hike a little south on the road and then pick up the yellow blaze Charles Pack Trail on the left and head generally south-east. We'll then finish up the hike on the eastern half of the orange blaze Agnes Brown Trail where we'll end near the Nature Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike should last no more than about 3.5 hrs. at a decent pace and be over by about 3:00 PM.  We can plan on going to the Log House on Rt. 44 after to snack and discuss out great accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water is a must on the hike -1 Qt. at least.  Bug spray is strongly advised. Food (e.g. trail mix) is optional but we do have a beautiful vista to take a break upon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A map can be found at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/stateparks/maps/peoples.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Hartford (about 45 min.):&lt;br /&gt;* Take Route 44 west&lt;br /&gt;* Take right onto Route 181, RIVER RD., about 1 mile&lt;br /&gt;* Go across the steel bridge&lt;br /&gt;* Take an immediate left onto East River Road&lt;br /&gt;* The parking area is approximately 1 mile up on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions to the parking area can be found via MapQuest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;addtohistory=&amp;amp;address=%5b100%2d109%5d%20E%20River%20Rd&amp;amp;city=Barkhamsted&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;zipcode=06063&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;location=1SQnVj2M956m56ubJXeg%2bk04z0uUP2laFE%2fs9mMspX1Jrkjs6AS7Ztl0svM2v1uchjVHWLTFQABAF6C24B8CygUeQ%2bZUxhenrkv9QiF0aNpO8DEqHlnlbOn3czLRyMDVvFh6m%2fseyi2KmSy17Qbe9ALHotoU15N%2b&amp;amp;ambiguity=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the state park, see:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&amp;amp;q=325054&amp;amp;depNav_GID=1650" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
