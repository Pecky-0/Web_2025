Sorry about the last minute change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to discuss some other FPA business.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Possible frequent change for our RCO&lt;br /&gt;CAP at FIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past Tuesday, we had a full schedule for our FPA meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, there has been a commission meeting that a lot of FPA members attended.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems everyone has a different take or more to add for the commission meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was an attorney there discussing legals and Gale assoc discussing the wind study. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we, the FPA, have agreed to run the Safety Committee. We should set up a few people to discuss these issues. Ie, line painting, 32 has obstruction light poles unlit. And a few other safety issues. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bullock hangar, see you all then.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290038950000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289505778000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FPA meeting updates RWY change/CAP/windstudy...  </name><id>15418008</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290034800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/15418008/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
