Bring a project or a problem, and get help from fellow Pythonistas.  Can't get that weird module installed properly?  Is threading twisting your brain in unpleasant ways?  Just want a nerd-filled room to quietly work on your side project?  You've come to the right place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to work on?  No expertise (I don't believe you)?  Come and watch the nerd sparks fly! Get inspired...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have some time up front for lightning talks: if you have a cool project, an idea, or even a burning question, take the mic for 5 minutes to let us know about it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ned Batchelder</member_name><member_id>1824278</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255564478000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251805304000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September open hack night (Cambridge Python meetup)</name><id>11256075</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253142000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/11256075/</event_url></item>
