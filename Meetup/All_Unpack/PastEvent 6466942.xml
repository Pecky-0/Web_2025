This audacious near-masterpiece finds Haneke again casting an Olympian eye on his fellow man. AllMovie Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Released in 2001 and starring Juliette Binoche, Michael Haneke (Cache, The Time of the Wolf) creates an intelligently constructed and compelling observation on social inequity, the injustice of cultural assimilation, and the failure of communication. Presented as a series of disassociated (and intrinsically ethnographic) episodes, the film follows separate lives that intersect in a single moment that alters all of them. We follow each character?s story, as the repercussions of each incident play out.

Neither screening time is really great for our group. If you are thinking of attending the HFA screening and/or are interested in Haneke' work in general,  please indicate so in your comment when you RSVP, even if its a NO.  There's a whole lot of Haneke screening this month and I'd like to know who is interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is the group's custom, Tom will be holding a meetup sign after the movie and then its off to a local cafe to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193436356000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191282299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Haneke's Code Unknown at the MFA</name><id>6466942</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193263200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6466942/</event_url></item>
