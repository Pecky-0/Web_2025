Smolak Farm has it all!!  This day that we will be here is Make Your Own Candy Apple!!  Yippppeeee!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people talk about Smolak Farms, they think of apples! You will not find as many varieties north of Boston as you will here! The crisp, freshness in every bite is what you will find with Smolak Farm's apples!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we visit their farm their Pumpkin Patch will have already been open for 2 weeks!  Spend the day choosing just the right pumpkins to adorn your front door. Most of their pumpkins are grown on the farm in all shapes, sizes and colors! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have over 30 varieties of apples to choose from, including Gravensteins, Macintosh, Cortland and Delicious – just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the adults: We can enjoy the all new hay maze, hay pyramid, batting cages, duck races etc......and of course lots of fun. There will be music and a food court, come and enjoy a day on the Farm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the kids: The new S'MO FUN FESTIVAL area will be loaded with exciting things for them to do, including....bouncy house, wee wagon rides, super slide, face painting, etc…….. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we are there don't forget to stop by the bakery for fresh-from-the-oven cider doughnuts (yummy it’s time for cider donuts!) or homemade pies on your way out!  Apple Cider Donuts will be freshly made all day... some say they are the best in New England, you be the judge!  Or if donuts aren't your thing maybe an ice cream from Treadwells ice cream will hit the spot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids of all ages are welcome at this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on everything that Smolak Farm has go check out their website at &lt;a href="http://www.smolakfarms.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.smolakfarm...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get lost or are running late call the Meetup phone at 978-304-2811.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you at this event!&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; Janet&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at the entrance to the Farm Stand</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284941717000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>A-Circle-of-Friends</urlname><id>1421257</id><group_lat>42.8100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8799972534</group_lon><name>A Circle of Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284238012000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Apple picking!</name><id>14736397</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284919200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/A-Circle-of-Friends/events/14736397/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/e/0/global_17863504.jpeg</photo_url></item>
