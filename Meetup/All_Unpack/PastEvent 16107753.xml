This weeks game is at 3.00pm on Sunday in Chicago, those of you that are making the trip to Soldier Field we hope you have a great time, for everyone else both floors will be open again (2nd floor open from 2pm) and hopefully we will have our biggest crowd for the season so far. As usual we will beer and food specials, GO PACK lets take Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray Butler&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>over 100</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Packers Boston &amp; Ray Butler</member_name><member_id>9971064</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295990317000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Greenbaypackersboston</urlname><id>1489502</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Green Bay Packers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295459639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Green Bay v Chicago</name><id>16107753</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295812800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Greenbaypackersboston/events/16107753/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/4/0/global_9669904.jpeg</photo_url></item>
