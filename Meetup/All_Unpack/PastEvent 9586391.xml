If you're not, that's absolutely fine, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's a solo portrait, that's OK. If it's a group shot, that's even better. This can be an old family portrait, a candid photo from your last vacation, a yearbook picture, a wedding portrait, a snapshot of you with your cat, an ID picture, anything you like. Bring more than one if you want to have a choice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo is a tool for you to use for a writing exercise, so it doesn't have to be high-quality. But it should be a hard copy (i.e., not digital), even if it's just a printout. If it's fragile, you may wish to bring a copy rather than the original. If you forget, I'll have some extra photos available -- but this exercise will work best if you use your own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following is the rest of the information on the workshop:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;By request: Here's the Creative Writing Workout, a longer version of the workshop that some of you took at our September 2008 retreat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne (who, outside of Meetup, is a professional writer) has taught variations on this workshop for more than 20 years in a variety of venues, including the Boston and Cambridge Centers for Adult Education, various writers' retreats and conferences and for private groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DATE/TIME:&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, Feb. 28, from 1 to 5 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt; Creative writing is an activity that will complement--and maybe even enhance--your other artistic endeavors. In this &lt;u&gt;non-threatening, low-stress&lt;/u&gt; workshop, we'll try several easy exercises designed to unleash your creativity and get your words flowing. Our focus is on personal expression in a supportive atmosphere, so you'll share what you've written &lt;i&gt;only if you so desire&lt;/i&gt;, and no one (not even you) will be allowed to critique your work. (Doesn't that sound liberating?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No previous writing experience is necessary, and one exercise will probably include a sketching element. You'll learn a few things, but you'll also have fun! And you'll go home with a list of writing resources and ideas for continuing your writing practice on your own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/b&gt; Any 18+ member of the NE ATC+ Meetup or the Altered Art/Assemblage Meetup, and their friends or guests. For everyone's comfort and enjoyment, we're limiting this workshop to active participants; please leave kids, friends and significant others at home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;VENUE:&lt;/b&gt; ArtStudio 360 in Holliston. Directions and a phone number will be e-mailed to registrants before the date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/b&gt; Our bright, pleasant studio offers free parking, table space for writing, a restroom, a fridge and access to spring water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/b&gt; A couple of pens (or pencils) that you like, and a notebook. If you've got an existing journal you'd like to use, that's fine; otherwise, any old spiral notebook will do. If you forget, no problem; I have extras. &lt;u&gt;Please don't plan to write on a laptop computer even if that's how you normally write&lt;/u&gt;--these exercises are all about putting pen or pencil) to paper! You may also bring snacks, if you so wsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST:&lt;/b&gt; $25. This covers the cost of materials, our venue's small per-person guest fee and your instructor's classroom and prep time. Please note that similar workshops taught by the same instructor cost four to five times as much in other venues, so this is a bargain. We're keeping the cost low for this first workshop, so our pioneering participants get a deep discount this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/b&gt; RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function. Sorry, no &amp;quot;maybes&amp;quot; available for this one, so if you're interested, please RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; -- you can always change it to &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CANCELLATION:&lt;/b&gt; If your plans change, switch your RSVP from &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; ASAP. If you need to cancel the day of the workshop, please call Anne as soon as possible (I'll send my phone number along with the Studio address when you RSVP). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the ArtStudio team needs to cancel the workshop due to weather or for any other reason, we'll post a message here AND e-mail or call anyone who's RSVP'd as far in advance as possible.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236525791000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232734933000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Creative Writing Workout in Holliston, 2/28</name><id>9586391</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235844000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/9586391/</event_url></item>
