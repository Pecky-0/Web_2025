&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the Hartford Region’s thriving startups and small businesses, the HYPE Entrepreneurship Awards have been instituted to engage and recognize Hartford’s budding and most enterprising ventures run by our young businesswomen and businessmen. The event will feature a cocktail reception, presentations from the finalists for both of the awards, and live judging by a panel of community business people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00pm Networking &amp;amp; Finalist Presentations &lt;br /&gt;

8:15pm Award Presentations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any current HYPE member is eligible to nominate their business venture for either of the awards. A Nomination Review Committee will use the information provided in the application to select finalists for each award. At the event on April 24th, finalists will have an opportunity to present their business to the panel of judges and the other attendees in an effort to show why their business is strong and poised to grow. The judges will select the final award winners immediately after hearing the presentations. Both winners will receive a $2,500 cash prize, a trophy and a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
