Since Nicole's hosting of this movie on Friday April 20 is full, I am planning another time for people to see it.  I called Coolidge Theatre and was told that it would probably be playing for a few weeks.  They decide on a week-to-week basis if they'll continue running a film, so we won't know for sure until the week before.  If it's not here, perhaps it will play somewhere else in the area.  I will keep you informed.  I'm listing the same time it's showing on April 20 which could change.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178549473000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176768768000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back by popular demand - "Black Book"</name><id>5677839</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178317800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5677839/</event_url></item>
