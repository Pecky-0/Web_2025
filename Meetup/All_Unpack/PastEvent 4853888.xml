<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Location Christopher's; near the Porter Square or Davis T-stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are questions about what is and is not notable, how to add to Wikipedia, how to research with it, and reflections on the event at Simmons library school (reactions from the students and staff, and followup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sj wants to talk about a lot of Wikimania stuff that we haven't gotten to in a while.  The program team  is busy picking out an ambitious list of speakers to invite, and distributing the call for participation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are issues of global wikis, translation of ideas, and collaboration across culture barriers to discuss -- tangents to the current Global Voices project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some new college-based wiki projects to talk about : The Penn State wiki and the Harvard wiki, for starters; ways to reach out to your own schools and companies, and when that might be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention very good food.  Please still TBD... somewhere in North Cambridge.    Plus a group outing to go contradancing afterwards in Concord--no dance shoes necessary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come one, come all !  Bring friends, loved ones, invisible pink unicorns...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Boston" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Boston" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>SJ</member_name><member_id>372973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282467157000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Wikipedians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wikipedia-5</urlname><id>165993</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Wikipedia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1139878844000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Wikipedia February Meetup, Part II</name><id>4853888</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1141084800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wikipedia-5/events/4853888/</event_url></item>
