<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi all-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be hosting a second Pug Meetup each month to cut down on the cramped quarters in the room with so many attendees, as well as offer a later playtime for those who cannot make it so early.  Please only sign up for one meetup each month to allow playtime for our members.  This meetup will be the &lt;b&gt;third Saturday each month from 1p-3p&lt;/b&gt;.   Let's see how this works out and it may be permanent.  if you have any feedback, please let me know your thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, If you decide to attend this meet instead of the one this Sat, May 3rd, please RSVP 'no' on this Sat to open that to another playmate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and see you at meetup!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2407140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211216856000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pug Devotee Extraordinaires</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-73</urlname><id>126274</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209564926000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2nd Pug Monthly Meet</name><id>7842252</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211043600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-73/events/7842252/</event_url></item>
