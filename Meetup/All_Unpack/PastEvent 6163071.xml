As with last month, our meetup will be held at Best Friends Pet Care in Boxford.  I think our first meetup last month went great.  There was plenty of fenced in space and lots of shade (which was great!).  The dogs went in the pool, ran around and had a great time.  Hopefully we will have some new members join us on Sunday, Sept 16th at 1:00pm.  Any friendly, active dog is welcome to join us for a few hours of fun.  Water bowls, toys, etc are provided. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on Saturday, Sept 15th there is a 'Responsible Dog Ownership Day' being held at the meetup location, Best Friends Pet Care in Boxford.  It is sponsored by the American Kennel Club.  There will be Canine Good Citizen Testing, reduced cost Micro-chipping (by Waters Edge Veterinary Hospital), cat and dog adoptions as well as lots of games and contests for owners and their dogs.  I think it should be a lot of fun for owners and pets.  Join us and check it out!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541934000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186855452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs September Meetup</name><id>6163071</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189962000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/6163071/</event_url></item>
