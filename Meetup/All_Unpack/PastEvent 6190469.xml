Lets meet at 11am. If anyone needs a ride, email me or call me on my cell at 617 501-6217. Bring ropes and slings if you have them. You should know how to belay and have a harness with a carabiner and belay device.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a Helmut if you have one. &lt;br /&gt;Also, there are no facilities. Bring water, food, sunscreen, camera, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will leave the parking lot area at 11:15am sharp. If you come afterwords, you will just have to walk around and ask for the Rock Climbing Boston Meetup. I will try to set up on the C-Wall, but if its really crowded, I may choose the J-Wall or S-Wall or another wall. For those not familiar with the Quarries, they have several walls or cliffs labeled A through S. Each wall contains several climbing routes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weather looks really bad for Sunday, I will send an email out Saturday Night, and we will meet at Metrorock. Otherwise assume we will be at the Quarries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  &lt;br /&gt;The Quincy Quarries Reservation is part of the Blue Hills Reservation, south of Boston. Take Route 93/3 to exit 8 in Quincy. Follow signs for Quarry Hills Recreation Complex until you come to Ricciuti Drive, between a Mr. Tux and a large Quarry Hills sign. It's quick going south, but a bit roundabout going north. Turn right on Ricciuti Drive. There is a small parking lot on your right (which is usually full and you will most likely see a line of cars on the opposite side of road where you can park).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya, &lt;br /&gt;Geoff &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187622392000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187263186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Top Roping at Quincy Quarries Saturday</name><id>6190469</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187449200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/6190469/</event_url></item>
