What gets in the way? When we begin to shift our attention to living more in the now, everything starts to change. When you think about it, what could be more important than being present: in your body, in your surroundings, in your relationships? Join us for this weekly meeting as we come together in meditation and discussion to explore this process called mindfulness. Your presence helps add more value to the group, and creates an impetus to develop a regular mindfulness practice. All levels of experience are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250545737000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246921404000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Meetup: Living in the NOW</name><id>10816666</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249941600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/10816666/</event_url></item>
