But song was the weapon of choice when, between 1987 and 1991, Estonians sought to free themselves from decades of brutal Soviet occupation. During those years, &lt;b&gt;hundreds of thousands gathered in public to sing forbidden patriotic songs and to rally for independence.&lt;/b&gt; James Tusty and Maureen Castle Tusty's feature documentary tells the moving story of how the Estonian people peacefully regained their freedom?and helped topple an empire along the way.  Kendall description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thrill of this documentary is in the remarkable story of the Little Country That Could.
