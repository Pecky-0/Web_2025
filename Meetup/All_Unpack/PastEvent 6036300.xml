We are very excited about this event! We have some fabulous models, very talented stylists, and make up artists participating!! So here are all the details -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at Teya's Studio in Oxford at 10:30 am SHARP. We will car pool and decide who can ride with who etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are asking that each of you chip in $25.00 toward the cost of the dresses that we bought for the event and to cover other expenses for this day. Please bring cash or a check made out to Teya Rutherford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will head off to Oakland Beach in West Warwick RI- it is an hour and fifteen min drive from the studio to the beach. We will meet at the beach and pick a place for lunch, so we can get to know one another and make further decisions about dresses, make up, and set up. There is a rest room, dunes, boat pier, etc at this beach - in fact here is a link to some of Dave's photos of the over all beach area if you want to preview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/DccCreations/OaklandBeach" target="_blank"&gt;http://picasaweb.goog...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be starting to shoot around 1:30 and go until dusk- when the beach closes. We can discuss dinner and rides home from that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind we have offered the models and makeup artists print or digital files in exchange for their talent and participation. They will be using this day as a portfolio building experence - just like you are. So it will be in all our best interested to exchange business cards while together or be sure you sign up in the web site Teya is building. She'll post the link as soon as she can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, comments etc, please post them to the discussion on the message board that is already started by Teya. She is also putting together a site for everyone to add there name, address, phone #, and email info so folks can set up car pools or other details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to a very fun day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185892898000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184688838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trash the Dress Click and Shoot Oakland Beach RI</name><id>6036300</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185719400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/6036300/</event_url></item>
