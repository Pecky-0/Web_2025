See their website &lt;a href="http://www.theislanderrestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Islander&lt;/a&gt; for menu, address and directions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Islander is well known in Rhode Island for their excellent food and pleasant service.  I have beent there several times, and I have to say, their garlic chicken is SUPER garlicy!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to reserve a setup for 18 with individual bills. If the event fills up, please respond as &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and state that you would like to be put on the wait list.
