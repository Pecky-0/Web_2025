If you like, come early and have something to eat or just sit and talk. The DJ that doesn't mind taking requests so bring your dancing shoes! We will be meeting for conversation and dinner at 7:30 on Saturday January 28th. Feel free to come for dinner or just for dancing. The DJ starts playing at 9:00 and runs until 1:00. There may be people from two other groups joining us as well. We usually sit all the way to the back of the room to the left of the dance floor or as close to there as possible! We'll have signs on the table. Hope to see you there :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327861577000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327409999000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ashworth by the Sea - Dinner/Dancing</name><id>49393482</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327797000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/49393482/</event_url></item>
