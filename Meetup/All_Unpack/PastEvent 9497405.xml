Having lived through two wars in his native Vietnam, he strives to prevent conflict of all kinds, from the internal violence of individual thoughts to interpersonal and international aggression. In this book he tells vivid, deeply affecting stories of his and his students wartime experiences in Vietnam and how they were able to remain nonviolent and work for peace in the face of the most stressful, dangerous, life threatening circumstances. The same teachings and practices that Thich Nhaht Hanh and his students use every day can help us, too, to create peace in our own lives, in every moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This discussion continues at the December meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published by Simon &amp;amp; Shuster, New York - paperback - $14.00.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a small sign on a cafe table that says "Book Discussion"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aurore Eaton</member_name><member_id>3983123</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263594446000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People interested in Buddhism</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha</urlname><id>447070</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Manchester Buddhism Sangha</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231682424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Creating True Peace by Thich Nhat Hanh</name><id>9497405</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257811200000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha/events/9497405/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/5/global_1946069.jpeg</photo_url></item>
