We'll ride to Bedford and back to Arlington (with a short rest at the Beford end of the trail), maintaining an average pace of about 13 mph (depending on bike trail traffic). Total distance should be somewhere around 16 miles. The ride should take about 1.25 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a public parking lot off of Medford Street in Arlington Center. Parking is free there from 6PM on. To avoid confusion, let's meet right under the minuteman bike trail sign (corner of Mass Ave and Pleasant Street) at 6:15PM and leave from there. Hope to see some of you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helmets and water recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet under sign for bike trail at corner of Route 60 (Pleasant Street) and Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington.
