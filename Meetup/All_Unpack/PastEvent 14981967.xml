If you're a groupie, you already know when to scream, &amp;quot;Where's your neck?&amp;quot; And if you're a &amp;quot;virgin,&amp;quot; come find out how to do the Time Warp. If you want to come dressed as Magenta or Brad, all the better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're doing 2 performances - we're going to the &lt;b&gt;10:30 pm show&lt;/b&gt; as that's going to be the funner one. We'll meet beforehand at 7:30 pm at &lt;a href="http://www.mewstavern.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mews Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in Wakefield for dinner/apps/drinks. Or if anyone has a better idea for a restaurant, let me know, I'm not that familiar with the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $18/adult. Please buy your own ticket through URI's &lt;a href="http://www.uri.edu/artsci/the/rocky_horror.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. **You should get your ticket early, as it may sell out.** This is general admission, so we'll get seats together when the house opens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play starts at 10:30 pm. If you can't make dinner beforehand, shoot me an email so we can look for you in the lobby of the Fine Arts Center. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Just a heads up - this is not your grandmother's kind of theatre. It's an engaging performance with lots of audience participation. You can expect to leave with rice in your hair. If you're the more subdued type, Shakespeare and the Lion King are your types of plays, this might not be the show for you. But if you're willing to experiment, you're definitely welcome! It's going to be a blast! :-) **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fasten your garter belts, come up to the lab and see what's on the slab! The Rocky Horror Show  is time-warping into Kingston for a two week limited-engagement run. URI Theatre will produce this hilarious, sinfully twisted salute to sci-fi, gothic, gender-bending and glam rock, all rolled into one madcap musical milestone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The phenomenon of &amp;quot;Rocky Horror&amp;quot; has left generations wondering what the meaning of this crazy show is. No matter the opinion, what the show has always managed to create is a vehicle for self-exploration and acceptance. So leave your critical faculties at the door, come in costumes, bring your props and surrender to the foolish fun of a &amp;quot;late-night double-feature picture show&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Email me if you can't make dinner</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291590739000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286113031000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rocky Horror Picture Show</name><id>14981967</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291509000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/14981967/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/a/global_18431306.jpeg</photo_url></item>
