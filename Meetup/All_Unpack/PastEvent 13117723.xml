Bonser, the former Minnesota Twins hurler, missed most of last season after undergoing surgery to repair partial tears to the labrum and rotator cuff in his right shoulder. He will be on an injury rehab assignment from the Red Sox as he recovers from a right groin strain suffered during spring training with the Red Sox on March 22. Bonser, 28, is 18-25 with a 5.12 ERA in 96 games with Minnesota. Ironically, his last two seasons in the minor leagues came with Rochester in 2005 and 2006 went he went a combined 17-13 for the Red Wings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't been yet McCoy Stadium is a great venue to watch a game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John Lund is hosting this one - please look at his picture!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
