Join us for a variety of different events and activities with a variety of differentÂ  local and international Groups. You get two privileges with membership. You can go to our events and activities, or you can Host or run your own with us. Our events &amp;amp; activities are run by member volunteers like you, called Asst. Organizers. The Organizers will do their best at these activities to introduce you to as many people as they can. We only asks you to be open to being introduced to others throughout the event. Upcoming events most often include: Dancing, Skating, Wimp Volleyball, Scuba Diving, Bonfire, Partys, Dinners, Picnics, Kayaking, Bicycling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's make this YOUR meetup, as your suggestions are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to "meeup" with you soon, SUZ&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.67</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1175109380000</created><lat>42.75</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>491</id><urlkey>dance</urlkey><name>Dance</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>590</id><urlkey>kayaking</urlkey><name>Kayaking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>705</id><urlkey>volleyball</urlkey><name>Volleyball</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>3105</id><urlkey>rollerskating</urlkey><name>Roller Skating</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>12605</id><urlkey>ski</urlkey><name>Ski</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15819</id><urlkey>hiking-biking-and-camping</urlkey><name>Hiking, Biking and Camping</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>83752</id><urlkey>live-rock-bands</urlkey><name>Live Rock Bands</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>882092</id><urlkey>bbq-and-bonfires</urlkey><name>BBQ and Bonfires</name></topics_item></topics><name>Dance &amp; Activities Meetup</name><id>462174</id><members>648</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>3950284</member_id><name>susan tisbert</name></organizer><urlname>dance-342</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/7/8/600_189993912.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/7/8/highres_189993912.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>189993912</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/7/8/thumb_189993912.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Nashua</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/dance-342/</link><lon>-71.4899978638</lon></item>
