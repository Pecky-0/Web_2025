<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><state>NH</state><who>Fun loving peeps</who><category><shortname>career-business</shortname><id>2</id><name>career/business</name></category><description>&lt;p&gt;Currently I have 3 meetups, and I would like to offer the following web address in a link form to those of you who are a member of this group, as it's been so hard for me to keep up more than one group, but I hate to just disolve this one, with so many of you in it. If you'd like to join my other general activity group called "Meeting and Greeting in So. NH &amp;amp; the Merrimack Valley area".  click here...there's alot of activities, with all the great event organizers I have, so alot going on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley/events/calendar/"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #3987cb"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley/events/calendar/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Also, I've been a Realtor for over 25 years, who is very active in Northeast Mass and So. NH.  I would love to offer my services, and I hope this coming spring to offer some buyer and seller programs through the meetup site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of you are facing foreclosure or need to sell, or owe too much on your home to sell, please email me for a consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of buying a home, it's important to align yourself with an experienced agent...one familiar with financing, home inspections, contracts, closings, and foreclosed properties and I have over 25 years experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is starting to pick up, and I am very hopeful for a prosperous year ahead for everyone.  In any economy the Real Estate market generally jumpstarts other industries, so let's all hope for our economy to improve and for all of us to hold onto our jobs, homes and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very truly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Tisbert&lt;/p&gt;
