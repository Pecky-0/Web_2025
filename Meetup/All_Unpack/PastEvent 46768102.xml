Not to mention we had a lovely time and amazing meal as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cafe Brazil serves large portions of authentic and delicious Brazilian cuisine and provides helpful, attentive and friendly service at a great price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beer and wine are the only alcohol served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="http://www.cafebrazilrestaurant.com/our_cuisine.html"&gt;Cafe Brazil dinner menu&lt;/a&gt; so you're prepared to order shortly after we're seated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note the lunch special will &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can only order from the dinner menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please mention in the comment if you want to do something afterward and ideas on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to plan your public transportation route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before I list the Reservation Rules, please understand the NO-SHOW policy was established to ensure everyone who wants to join can and it will be fairly and strictly enforced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to assure you I do understand if you've RSVPd YES and you have a sudden change of plans because you're lost, you don't feel well, you have transportation issues, you don't have the money, you just don't want to be around people or whatever the reason. My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules for Events with Reservations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is less than an hour from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST contact me by calling or texting me at &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(617) 445-7549&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or email at snowrover@yahoo.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring enough CASH to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All RSVPs are on a first reply, first reserved basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the dinner is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP and your answering the RSVP question .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the dinner and you have not attended, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within an hour of the dinner, without contacting me, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email &lt;a href="http://portuguese.meetup.com/316/suggestion/"&gt;Tonya&lt;/a&gt; about rejoining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so please, rate the event and venue by completing  thesurvey afterward.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya reservation</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Manoel</member_name><member_id>8406646</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351465613000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325767939000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cafe Brazil Dinner at 1 PM</name><id>46768102</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351443600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/46768102/</event_url></item>
