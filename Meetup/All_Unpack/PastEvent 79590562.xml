&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;The meetup time is 6:30 if you aren't able to show up then, then come when you can and find us either inside or on the deck.  See you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.9.12 UPDATE: There is a $5.00 cover charge which starts at 8:00. I am not able to put in a reservation for tables on the deck.  Also we may not be sitting near each other and/or who knows how many tables will be open when we get there.  Please be patient as you wait for tables to be open.  You may be sitting with people that you don't know...... but that could be a good thing, who knows you may make a new friend or two??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go Back to Salisbury Beach and check out Don't Call Me Shirley at SurfSide5 Beach Bar &amp;amp; Grille it is their debut!!!  Let's go cheer them on and blow the neighbors away.  SurfSide 5 features a huge 8,000 sq.ft. deck located directly over the ocean, SurfSide5 is the place to catch the surf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get there early grab a bite to eat, then settle in to see the band.  IF you plan on coming for dinner, put it in your RSVP "&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dinner/band&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" or "&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;band&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" and no dinner that way I know. Menu: &lt;a href="http://www.northshorepavilion.com/surfside5/restaurant-menu.html"&gt;http://www.northshorepavilion.com/surfside5/restaurant-menu.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
