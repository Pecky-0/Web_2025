 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Every month they provide a themed Blues series and a beginner crash course with a different set of teachers. On the last Thursday of the month, we hold a Blues Clinic instead of the lesson. The Blues Clinic is like an opportunity to get a mini private lesson with Blues Union instructors. The instructors will make sure to work individually with everyone at the practice for a portion of the evening.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;You can work on anything you want (vocabulary, connection, stuff you learned in the previous month&amp;rsquo;s classes, etc). Though no partner is required, they suggest you bring someone with whom to practice &amp;amp; try new things, since you will not be working with a teacher the entire time.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The floor is beautiful, the vibe is chill, and we always have baked goods!
