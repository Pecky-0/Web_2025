Lots of walkers, runners, and  dogs.  They also provide poop stations.  I go all the time on the weekends, any weekend would be good.  ps they're pretty strict about &amp;quot;no off leash&amp;quot; which is ok with me. Small parking lot in the front by the chapel.  large parking lot not plowed so parking can be challenging if there is anything happening at the chapel. Anyone who wants to go let me know.

It's the only place I know of that clears the sidewalks all winter. With all the snow, it's been difficult to go on walks so I drive to Framingham.  </why><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1298482076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pack Walk Cushing Park</name><id>16674893</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1305471600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/16674893/</event_url></item>
