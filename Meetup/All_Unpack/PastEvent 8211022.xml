In our group, we are not only out to get a good fitness ride in (average pace 12-15 mph) but I like for people to leave our rides feeling like they just made a bunch of great new friends! Join us! We're a fun group and we love cycling!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you join us, please bring your humor and sense of adventure because, yes it's true, we even get lost sometimes :-) as we explore new routes together?.it keeps things exciting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually wrap up the ride with a bite to eat or an ice cream somewhere in the vicinity of the ride's end point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free at anytime to write me with any questions that you have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Fox, Organizer &lt;br /&gt;robfox@verizon.net&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call my cell on the day of the ride if you need 617-894-8454</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rob Fox</member_name><member_id>4368625</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216515563000</updated><rating><average>3.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214392734000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester/Gloucester/Rockport  - Let's try again!</name><id>8211022</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214663400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/8211022/</event_url></item>
