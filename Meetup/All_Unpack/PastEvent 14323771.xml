Rick and Karin Dina, D.C.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Different Approaches to Raw:&lt;br /&gt;Which One is Best for You?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This presentation covers the pros and cons of various approaches to raw food nutrition.  It takes a rational look at the often conflicting recommendations by various raw food leaders and puts them into a sensible format.  We'll touch on how to design an individualized raw diet that combines different aspects from the various approaches to help you achieve optimal health while still taking into account your personal preferences!  We will also discuss what lab data can help you know if you are on the right track or not, as well as how some of those criteria can be different for those on a largely raw vegan diet.
