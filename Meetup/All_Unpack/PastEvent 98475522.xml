&lt;p&gt;EMS manager Larry Bliss will discuss the various aspects of snowshoe equipment and techniques followed by a snowshoe outing if the weather has cooperated by supplying a few inches of snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a beginner or in need of a refresher course, join us for a fun and informative morning.  Be sure to dress for the weather in layers and sturdy boots and bring trekking poles if you have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*THERE ARE NO MORE SNOWSHOES AVAILABLE FOR LOAN AT THIS TIME.  CHECK BACK.*  IF YOU RSVP AFTER 5:45 PM ON JANUARY 10, YOU MUST PROVIDE YOUR OWN SNOWSHOES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A limited number of snowshoes will be available at no charge for those who need to borrow equipment from EMS.  As snowshoe size is dependent on weight, be sure to take any winter clothing and packs into account when answering the questions below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight ranges are up to 140 pounds, 130 to 180 pounds, and over 160 pounds.  If you fall into two ranges, such as weighing 135 or 170, please indicate this to facilitate the assigning of equipment.  Contact the organizer if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have your own snowshoes, it is not necessary to respond to the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no snow but the weather is good, a hike will be held mid-morning, details to follow cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Troll</member_name><member_id>11017991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361279873000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357608215000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>EMS/FMSSF Snowshoe Clinic</name><id>98475522</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361023200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/98475522/</event_url></item>
