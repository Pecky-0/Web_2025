Whether you're new in town or following up on that New Year's resolution to expand your circle of friends (like we are), this is an opportunity to meet some people over some excellent sushi and a sake or two. We'll book the table (they have cool little private rooms that hold 14 or 24 people), you bring your partner, your appetite and your sociability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it appears we have plenty of interest, I've booked the table for 24 people on March 17th at 7:30.&amp;nbsp; If we have more interest than available space, we'll run a waiting list and I'll confirm that everyone is attending a few days in advance.&amp;nbsp; We look forward to seeing you all then!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333928217000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327691381000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Fugakyu in Brookline</name><id>49885272</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332545400000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/49885272/</event_url></item>
