We are meeting at 6pm at the Betahouse which is at 13 Magazine St. #2, just a couple blocks west of Mass Ave in Central Square. Here is a &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/28zbf6" target="_blank"&gt;Google map&lt;/a&gt;  to parking options. We will order some pizzas and can stay as late as we want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda: We'll be holding a minisprint to develop our bostonplone.org website. We welcome all levels of developers and users. Maybe you want to write some blog entries, or add a photo gallery. Perhaps you're interested in skinning the site, or upgrading the site to Plone 3.0 -- help to make the site yours! Bring your ideas, questions, and enthusiasm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For inspiration and ideas, take a look at what other Plone user groups are doing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://plone.org/support/local-user-groups" target="_blank"&gt;http://plone.org/supp...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197332763000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193961969000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone December Meetup</name><id>6659287</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196985600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/6659287/</event_url></item>
