Their website doesn't say what the specific content of the lecture is going to be, but these amazing little critters have been in the news (as in Science in the News), so here's a few links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/robotics-software/behold-the-flying-robots" target="_blank"&gt;http://spectrum.ieee....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100624091751.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sciencedai...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those not familiar with the SITN lecture format, lectures are free, accessible, and open to the public. All lectures are given entirely by graduate students at Harvard and focus on hot topics in science research and news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All lectures are on Wednesdays starting at 7 PM at the Armenise Amphitheater at Harvard Medical School (&lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; Harvard Square!). They are 2 hours in length, with a 10 minute break in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will have light refreshments before the lecture (coffee, tea, cookies, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested in going out afterwards for food and/or drinks, there are a few options nearby - a Bertuccis, and a couple of pub/pizza places that I've never been to but look decent.  We can play by ear if folks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/sitn-seminars/" target="_blank"&gt;SITN Info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Directions:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best way to get there is by T.  The closest stop is the Green Line E train at Longwood Medical Area.  Once you get off the train, the street that immediately intersects Huntington Ave is Longwood Ave.  Walk down Longwood (right as you're facing outbound on Huntington Ave, left as you're facing inbound) for a couple blocks until you get to what looks like a half traffic circle on the right at Avenue Louis Pasteur.  The Harvard Medical School Quadrangle will be on your left.  Facing into the quadrangle, the closest building on your left is Armenise.  Go down to the courtyard cafe entrance, and if you don't find us there you should see signs directing you to SITN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/images/maps/quadmap.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there from the Green Line D train, get off at the Longwood stop, go to Longwood Ave, go left, cross Riverway and Brookline Ave, then walk a few more blocks (if you cross Kent St, you went the wrong way).  The half traffic circle will be on your left, and the quadrangle on your right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should really, &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; resist the urge to drive.  But if you must, please see SITN's link (keeping in mind that you will pay dearly for parking):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/directions/" target="_blank"&gt;SITN Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be on the benches outside the main entrance of the Courtyard Cafe, with a meetup sign. We'll meet between 6:30 and 6:45, then go in and have refreshments before the lecture.  I'll email my cell number to folks the day of the event.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>5195575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285869005000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285261981000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SITN Lecture - Bots That Mimic Bugs: Flying, Crawling, and Squishy Robots</name><id>14871757</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285801200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14871757/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/b/global_18181323.jpeg</photo_url></item>
