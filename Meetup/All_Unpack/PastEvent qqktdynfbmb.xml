Our members come from many backgrounds and feature varying interests as well as degrees of writing experience. Our focus is to offer valuable insight and suggestions, rather than strident criticism, that help to make writers' work more interesting and meaningful. Come join us as we explore the fascinating world of ideas as they relate to the written word. We look forward to seeing you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268353915000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fiction Book Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>earon-90</urlname><id>443052</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6200027466</group_lon><name>The first time book writers club for non-professionals</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265162857000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The first time book writers club for non-professionals Meetup</name><id>qqktdynfbmb</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268181000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/earon-90/events/12502640/</event_url></item>
