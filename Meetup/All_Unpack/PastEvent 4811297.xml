Covering templates, components, modules and mambots, you will learn additional tricks and tips to get the most out of your Joomla! site. Additonal coverage will center on third party developers and business strategies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final topic is how to organize open source projects, and common pitfalls and challenges. There are many open source projects that fall prey to poor planning and organization, and you have a variety of resources to pull from to ensure your project doesn't get lost to&lt;br /&gt;politics or bad practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch will then close the session answering questions from the Boston PHP crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optaros is located next to TD Banknorth Garden, so there's plenty of nearby parking and access via the Green and Orange Line. There is NO Garden event scheduled for the 6th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.BostonPHP....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1133915613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston PHP Meetup January Meetup</name><id>4811297</id><headcount>33</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1136331000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/4811297/</event_url></item>
