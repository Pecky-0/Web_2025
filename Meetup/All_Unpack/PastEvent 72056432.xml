&lt;p&gt;Total distance will be around 17 miles (depending car spot), nearly 6,000 feet of elevation gain, and we'll tag four 4K peaks and a NE Hundred Highest peak!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a long day, so we'll meet at 8am at the Oliverian Brook Trailhead first where we'll car spot and then head back down the Kanc to begin our hike up Pine Bend Brook Trail to the Tripyramids. Then we'll head over to the Kate Sleeper trail and across the Sleepers to Whiteface and Passaconaway and out the Oliverian Brook trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hike is considered advanced due to distance, pace and elevation. To sign up for this hike, you should be an experienced hiker who has recently done trips of this length--15+ miles--and elevation gain and be able to hike at least book time or faster. We'll keep it reasonable given the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that there are no huts or water stops along this traverse and it will be hot, so come prepared with extra water (or a filtration device), gatorade (or some sort of electrolyte/salt mixture) and plenty of food. We'll need to be self-sustaining for the duration of the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting time/place: 8 am at the Oliverian Brook Trailhead (GPS coordinates are: N43° 59.642 | W071° 21.025) Rt 112/Kancamagus Highway - about 21 miles east of Lincoln. Google Maps indicates this is a 3 hour drive from Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event. YOU MUST include your cell phone when responding to this meetup since the hike is tomorrow and that will be the only way to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please answer the RSVP questions in full.&lt;/p&gt;
