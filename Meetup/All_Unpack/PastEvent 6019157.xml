It is, in other words, a restaurant worth knowing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cuisine here is probably best described as &amp;quot;American comfort food&amp;quot;, with a smattering of Italian-style dishes and a greater emphasis on seafood than most places that don't have &amp;quot;Seafood&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Clam Shack&amp;quot; in their names. Lunch offerings start with sandwiches (from plain ol' ham and cheese to lobster rolls to the &amp;quot;Larkin&amp;quot;, made with grilled chicken, Swiss cheese and Canadian bacon) and burgers (from a basic hamburger to the &amp;quot;Aspen Burger&amp;quot; with sour cream and mushrooms), then move on to fried seafood plates (smelt and calamari, to name two), pasta dishes (chicken parmesan, mussels marinara, sweet Italian sausage) and entrees including baked meatloaf, sauteed liver with onions and even a baked oyster casserole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your mouth is watering at this point, please plan to join us on Saturday, July 28 at 12:00 Noon as we sample the Milepost's easy combination of excellent food and informal elegance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $2pp &lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: None. &lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: 5pm on Friday, July 27th (Any changes made after this time may not be seen by the Event Organizer prior to the event.) &lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer: Mike&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Place: Please meet at the hostess station. If it is a nice day outside then we will probably be outside the front door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring cash. You are responsible for your portion of the bill including drinks, food, shared food, tax, and tip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;From Rt 3, take Exit 10 and head north on Rt 3A; i.e., take a right off the ramp from Rt 3 North (coming from the Cape) or a left off the ramp from Rt 3 South (coming from Braintree). Hint: If you find yourself at a traffic light looking directly across Rt 3A at a mall containing a Hannaford Supermarket and an Ocean State Job Lot, you went the wrong way off the ramp and need to make a 180 degree turn.&lt;br /&gt;You should almost immediately pass through a small cluster of businesses including Bennet Gas on your right.&lt;br /&gt;Travel distance on Rt 3A is just about 1.5 miles. Shortly before you get to the restaurant you'll see (on your right) a playground behind a chainlink fence. Also on your right at this point you'll note a yellow, diamond-shaped sign reading &amp;quot;School Bus Stop Ahead&amp;quot; and another with a symbol denoting a pedestrian crossing. &lt;br /&gt;Watch carefully on your right because you will quickly come to the intersection of Rt 3A and Chestnut St., where Chestnut St. is a right turn toward S. Duxbury while Rt. 3A bears to the left. The Milepost Restaurant is on the near right corner of this intersection. For those who attended the breakfast Meetup at the Wildflower Cafe, you will probably remember turning onto Chestnut St. to get to the Wildflower.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Angela</member_name><member_id>341074</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312746624000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>South Shore Diners</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssdomg</urlname><id>313308</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184343854000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lunch?
