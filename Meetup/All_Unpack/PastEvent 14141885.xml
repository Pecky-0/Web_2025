A tiny hero... with a sword!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouse Guard is based on David Petersen's comics and uses a focused version of Luke Crane's Burning Wheel system.  You play a guardmouse sworn to protect the Mouse Territories and the mice within from dangers, inside and out.  And there is plenty of danger out there, let me tell you.  Ever had a bear raid your beehive?  Ever worry the tiniest rain shower could mean mice lost in a flood?  Have you ever had to convince a mayor to cancel the parade and prepare the townsmice for an incursion from weasels?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world of larger-than-mouse threats, there is only the Guard.  May the Guard prevail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the August installment of our series of one-shot indie RPG experiences to be offered monthly over the course of 2010.  Each month will feature a different GM running a new game.
