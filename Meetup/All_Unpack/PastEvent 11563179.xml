Most people are tight in key areas affecting the spine, for example in the hips and shoulders. A system such as yoga, which releases the tension in the muscles, should improve back pain. Come and learn poses designed to prevent back pain through improving basic spinal flexibility, strengthening the core and the spinal support muscles, and becoming comfortable with the movements that control flexion and extention of the spine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn how to strengthen your core and get strong abs with Zumba. Zumba fuses hypnotic latin rhythms and easy to follow moves to create a dynamic fitness program that will blow you away. Zumba features interval training sessions where fast and slow rhythms, and resistance training are combined to tone and sculpt your body, specifically your core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoga is from 6:00pm-7:00pm.&lt;br /&gt;Zumba is from 7:00pm-8:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A $5 donation is requested to help support the Growing Green Co-Op.
