The Providence Community Library has arranged for a viewing of Helen Stickler's 1995 film, &amp;quot;André The Giant Has A Posse,&amp;quot; a documentary short that features Shepard Fairey and his influential street art campaign throughout the city. The film was internationally screened, gaining considerable attention at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. In 2003 Village Voice film critic Ed Halter described the film as &amp;quot;legendary ... a canonical study of a Gen-X media manipulation. One of the keenest examinations of '90s underground culture.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Action Speaks Special - Free Culture&lt;br /&gt;Live Forum at the AS220 Performance Space&lt;br /&gt;115 Empire St Providence, RI 02903&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Discussion on Free Culture with Artist Shepard Fairey and Political Activist and Author Lawrence Lessig Moderated by Host Marc Levitt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of Providence's nationally known Action Speak radio show, artist and inaugural honoree of the AS220 Free Culture Award, Shepard Fairey, and Harvard law professor, political activist and &amp;quot;Free Culture&amp;quot; author Lawrence Lessig, will take part in a conversation with Marc Levitt, it's Host and Creative Director. The conversation will include Mr. Fairey's work as a public artist, his influences and ideas on the creative process, as well as Mr. Lessig's notion of the Public Commons, copywrite legislation and free software. In keeping with the theme of Action Speaks' &amp;quot;Underappreciated Dates that Changed America,&amp;quot; Mr. Levitt will ask both men to comment on significant moments in their personal, artistic and political evolution as well those dates in the world of public art and cyberspace access that changed how we viewed and participated with the world. The public will be invited to join the discussion with comments and to ask questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you will join us as we celebrate a quarter century of unjuried, uncensored art in downtown Providence.
