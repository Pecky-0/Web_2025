In this mini-workshop you’ll have the opportunity to connect with others through verbal sharing and exercises designed to open your heart. Come and get a taste of what you’ve been craving, in a totally safe, non-sexual environment. Come and enjoy yourself. There won’t be a hard-sell. We promise. Our goal is to give you a meaningful evening of itself and to provide with information on this weekend long workshop.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Glenn Bigonet</member_name><member_id>9409368</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270335785000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Create-the-life-you-ve-always-wanted</urlname><id>1441068</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2300033569</group_lon><name>Get More Out of Life!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265296845000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Need Love?
