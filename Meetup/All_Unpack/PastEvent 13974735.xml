If you've been there than you know what they are talking about.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Center has actually been redone lately and has many places to go out to and you can always find one that fit's your style. In general though the area is more upscale than Hartford downtown.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting up at Elbow Room and mingling there. It's not guaranteed we'll stay their but it's a nice place to start.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting up top on the roof. Call me if you get disorientated.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Roshi ~ &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279989388000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278013196000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Cool Place to go : West Hartford Center </name><id>13974735</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279933200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/13974735/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/global_16122212.jpeg</photo_url></item>
