With material ranging from the 1950's to present, the group always brings home their own style of quality peformance.  Whether &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;new school&amp;quot; music, state fairs or private situations, &lt;b&gt;The Floyd Patterson Band&lt;/b&gt; never fails to keep their audiences satisfied as evidenced by the awards they've recieved in past years.  Anyone I know who has seen this band has always given it rave reviews.  Pazzo Ristorante is a chic and trendy club restauraunt in the renovated riverfront district of Springfield.  It is near the Basketball Hall of Fame.  More info can be found at &lt;u&gt;www.pazzohof.com&lt;/u&gt; It is highly recommended by members of our group.  We will meet an hour before the entertainment at the bar to enjoy a few drinks.  This event will be a night to remember....&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203298479000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200363073000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Floyd Patterson Band at Pazzos</name><id>7116522</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203125400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/7116522/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/6/b/global_2890459.jpeg</photo_url></item>
