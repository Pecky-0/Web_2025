 &lt;br /&gt;

There's no info online about it.  It's a sensitive area with some access issues from time to time.  There is a small parking lot at the crag that fills up quickly.  There is an overflow lot in a neighborhood about a mile or so hike away from the crag.  Let's make sure we car pool.  It would be great if we could limit the number of vehicles to 2 or 3 max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are routes at all grades there including lots of sport and trad and top ropes can be set up too.  This is the best(only?) sport climbing in MA.  It's about 1.5 hours from Boston on Rt. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need a harness, shoes, a belay device and the knowledge of how to use it at a minimum.  If you've never climbed outside before please email me before rsvping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll email a link with better location and directions to those who rsvp.  Email me with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Important!  When you rsvp, please indicate whether you can provide gear for sport climbing and a rope!&lt;/p&gt;
