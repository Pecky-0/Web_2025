He has worked at early human fossil sites throughout East Africa, and has studied a population of wild chimpanzees in western Uganda. Dr. DeSilva specializes in biomechanics and has particular interest in the origins and evolution of upright walking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last decade, researchers have unearthed dozens of new fossil humans, decoded the human and chimpanzee genomes, and made important new discoveries about our African ape cousins. This talk will explore what we currently know about human origins and evolution, how we know it, and what questions still remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a fascinating presentation.  It will start at 7 at the UU Church of Worcester, with doors opening at 6:30 for socializing and conversation.  It is free and open to the public.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256698045000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253128107000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Apes, Bones and Genes: The Science of Human Origins."</name><id>11389333</id><headcount>57</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255474800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/11389333/</event_url></item>
