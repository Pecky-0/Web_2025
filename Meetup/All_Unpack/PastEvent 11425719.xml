In preparation for that, I need to wash my airplane. After a summer of squashing bugs with my leading edges, it is time to make it shine again. Especially, since people are going to come look at it at the Wings and Wheels. I figure, you might be in the same boat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to invite everyone to the airport to wash their airplane and have a good time doing it. I will supply some buckets, hoses, soap, and a vacuum. Just taxi down to the Bullock Hangar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is there will be &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt; Steamers, Lobsters and Steak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; there to eat! We will also have hamburgers and hotdogs if that interests you. So &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;please bring the family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the more helping hands the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please respond with how many Lobster and/or Steak eaters you are bringing.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255475303000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253540104000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall PropWash (with Lobsters, Clams, &amp; Steaks!)</name><id>11425719</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254668400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/11425719/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/b/0/global_10827248.jpeg</photo_url></item>
