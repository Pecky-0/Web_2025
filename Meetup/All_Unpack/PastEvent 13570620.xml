Cambridge is a melting pot of cultures and cuisines, and the 2010 Taste of Cambridge features creative and abundant samples of food and drink from some of this city’s most popular restaurants. Enhanced by a beautiful outdoor setting, live music and a great crowd, the TOC has feet become one of Cambridge’s most anticipated annual events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Taste of Cambridge is organized and run by CLAB, which works to prevent underage drinking and to educate and support liquor license holders in their efforts to prohibit sales to minors. CLAB was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation in Massachusetts in 1997 and has since been a front-runner in non-traditional responses to licensee infractions. As an alternative to suspending licenses, the city encourages the continuity of this licensee moderation group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste of Cambridge attendees will have the opportunity to sample delicious fare from all corners of the city, while contributing to the greater good of Cambridge community as all proceeds from this event benefit our valued charity partners.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Gluck</member_name><member_id>2864884</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277909293000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Citizens of the World</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Moveable-Feast</urlname><id>370532</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Moveable Feast</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274644896000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Taste of Cambridge</name><id>13570620</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277847000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast/events/13570620/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/4/global_14000500.jpeg</photo_url></item>
