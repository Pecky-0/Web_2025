Ive had many requests to host a dance for people of our age group so we can hear the music we like without it starting too late, being so loud your teeth chatter, or so we don't have to compete for floor space with patrons young enough to be our children....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is our&amp;nbsp;2nd installment in the MEETUP DANCE SERIES !!!!.... We will be posting it in a few different groups so make sure you tell your friends. You can bring guests who are not in our group. If this does well, I will organize more at different venues and possibly with bands too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need at least 40 people to sign up for me to reserve the room. There will be a $8 fee that you have to pay ahead of time. If I don't get 40 paid responses. I will have to reschedule. I'll&amp;nbsp; be using PAYPAL so don't worry, noone in the group or at MEETUP will ever have access to your credit card. If you don't have means to pay online you have to get me $$ by some other means....if we hit the 40 prepaid then the rest can pay at the door. But until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you in groups other than the South Shore HIke Bike &amp;amp; Social Club you can make the payment via paypal to my email address - &lt;a href="mailto:afadj@yahoo.com"&gt;afadj@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thanks everyone - I hope you can make it....Please RSVP right away. !!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
