<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>And part 2 of the big day continues at Mohegan Sun. &lt;br /&gt;At 7:00 pm, all members should meet at the big glass sculpture, seen here &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojay/201906373/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.flickr.com...&lt;/a&gt; . It is most easily found by coming in at the Hotel entrance or heading towards the waterfall. From there, the group will grab dinner before heading up to Ultra 88. If you are not at the sculpture by 7:15, the group will go on without you to grab dinner. You can meet up with us mid meal but everyone should be done eating by 9:30 at the latest. &lt;br /&gt;Timing is important for this night as Ultra 88 fills up fast and after 10 becomes a huge pain to get in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, Ultra 88 has a dress code which is sometimes enforced. Button down shirts are encouraged strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultra 88 is a fun spot with tons of girls to meet. Let's do it up and do it big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the last event of May. After this, members' participation will be evaluated. This will be the last opportunity to participate as a part of the Wingmen.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Know my pic or call me, (203) 410 6861</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319645515000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242105293000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday - May 30th - Part 2 - Mohegan Sun / Ultra 88</name><id>10392141</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243724400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10392141/</event_url></item>
