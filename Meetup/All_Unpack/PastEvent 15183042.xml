I can not believe it is almost Nov!!  Our meetup is going to be Nov 5 at 6:30.  This months presenter is going to be yours truly Chef KO Bisson.  I will be doing a couple of raw food demos.  If you have any dishes you would like to see made...let me know.  I am up for the challenge :).&lt;br /&gt;As usual it will be a potluck so please bring an organic raw food dish enough for 6-8 people.  If you are new and not sure what to bring a salad, fruit or veggie, is always good.  Can't wait to see everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;$2 for Adults....Children always free!&lt;br /&gt;If you would like me to make your dish...I would be happy to for $15.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289345828000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287674630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nov!!
