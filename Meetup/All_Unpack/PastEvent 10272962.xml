We meet every Monday night (except Holiday Mondays) at the Holiday Inn Nashua off of Exit 4, Route 3 at 7:00pm. Go through lobby and keep going straight until you see the restaurant. Look for the people playing games in the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually get about 25-30 people and have maybe 5-6 games going at once.  This really is a fun way to meet new people and socialize.  If this is your first time, please ask for Robert or Bill or Bobbi and introduce yourself, so that we can get you started on a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Gamers/calendar/10162418/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to the restaurant and ask for Robert.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242861027000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240793135000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gamers Event: The Greater Nashua Gamers Meeting</name><id>10272962</id><headcount>33</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242687600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/10272962/</event_url></item>
