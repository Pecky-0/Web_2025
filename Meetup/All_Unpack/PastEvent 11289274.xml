Please make sure you check your e-mails the afternoon of the event at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you the meetup is maxed out, and you still want to meet with the group on Saturday night, you may still do so at McFadden's at 10pm. I worked out a deal with them that if you show up before 10:30pm, you do not have to pay cover or wait in line. Just mention Newcomers at the door.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255279165000</updated><rating><average>3.8599998951</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252077548000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BARS</name><id>11289274</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254614400000</time><rsvp_limit>55</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11289274/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
