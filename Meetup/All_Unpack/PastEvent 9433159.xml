(no offense to all of you couples we are all very happy for you...just not on Valentines Day!!!) So, we're having a party and you are all  invited couples and singles over 40. We'll even have a Valentine's Day Mistletoe for some of you to kiss and renew your commitments to each other. There are some rules however... Everyone must have an item of clothing with a Valentine's Day Theme. Like a shirt with Hearts all over it... Best Dressed will recieve a Valentine's Gift Basket. Okay, spend around 5or 6 dollars on a valentine's gift for the swap wrapped appropriately for our theme. This is an adult party so be fun and creative with those valentine's swap gifts... Lisa will make a huge lasagna and everyone bring a small side. There is a big screen and I am sure some Lesbian themed movies will be on also. Please don't bring desert that's my speciality! Bring your own beverage and prepare to laugh and have alot of fun. Happy New Year! We're having a Party!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 6874991</member_name><member_id>6874991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235444049000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Gay Women Over 40</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>lgbtfriends-212</urlname><id>1155810</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>WEST OF BOSTON OVER 40 GAY WOMENS MEET-UP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230996748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Valentine's Yankee Swap Potluck Party</name><id>9433159</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234641600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lgbtfriends-212/events/9433159/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/0/global_4210720.jpeg</photo_url></item>
