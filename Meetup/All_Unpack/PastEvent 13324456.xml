From what I remember, the course is pretty flat.  Since it is going to be a beautiful weekend and too hard to pass up golf when it is nice, I wanted to put it on the calendar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know as soon as possible, if you can.  Thank you.  Enjoy the rest of your week.  I look forward to hearing from you.
