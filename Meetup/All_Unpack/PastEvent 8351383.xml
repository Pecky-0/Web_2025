We have a few openings left and I wanted to open the invitation to this group.  The cookout is being held at my cottage in Old Saybrook this Sunday at 3:00 pm.  There is a charge for the event, $32.00, which has to be paid in advance.  The deadline for payment is Thursday, July 16 at midnight (sorry for the short notice). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lobster&lt;br /&gt;Clams&lt;br /&gt;Clam Chowder&lt;br /&gt;Corn on the Cob&lt;br /&gt;Potatos&lt;br /&gt;Cole Slaw&lt;br /&gt;Dessert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have some soft drinks, ice, cups and coolers available, but other beverages are BYOB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We held this event last year and it was a great success.  Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216753558000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216218382000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lobster Cookout in Old Saybrook</name><id>8351383</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216580400000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/8351383/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/6/9/global_4811737.jpeg</photo_url></item>
