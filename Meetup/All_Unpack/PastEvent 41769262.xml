There is a 1 mile loop and a 1 1/4 mile loop. I walk here all the time. There are lots of joggers, walkers, kids, dogs etc.... I like this park because the trail is wide and always clean. AND it's one of the only trails that is maintained throughout the winter. There are two parking lots, one in front of the Chapel and a larger one to the right of the Chapel, we can meet in front of the Chapel by the picnic tables (if they are still there).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maria Soma</member_name><member_id>12357610</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322323471000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321748234000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Post Pigout Pack Walk (day after Thanksgiving)</name><id>41769262</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322233200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/41769262/</event_url></item>
