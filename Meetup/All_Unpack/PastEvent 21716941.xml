People talk about soul in many
contexts, and somehow we know it means something deeply important
for us as human beings, but who knows what a soul really is? What
is our true relationship with this aspect of ourselves? You can
come to know your soul and gain realization about the purpose of
your soul's existence through meditation. Come to this class to
begin to learn how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a six-week class series called Meditation &amp;amp;
Mysticism: Learn How to Experience God Inside Yourself. It is a
powerful introductory course designed for those who are seeking an
inner experience of God through meditation. Classes include
teachings on the practices of the mystics and how they can be
applied in the modern western world. Mysticism refers to "the
practice of knowing the reality of God through direct experience."
It is certainly nothing new, as it has always been at the core of
every religion and represents a more inner, experiential way of
coming to know God and the spiritual world. We offer this series as
an opportunity for you to discover whether the mystical path might
be right for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will be spent teaching the principles of meditation that
will allow you to move deeper than the body, beyond thinking and
emotions, and into the reality of God's peace and presence within.
Each class begins with a guided meditation that will help you begin
to learn to&amp;nbsp; meditate or will help you deepen the spiritual
dimension of your current practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;This class teaches an introduction to mysticism in the
Christian tradition, though the truths are the same as those taught
in all mystical traditions. Everyone is welcome, no matter what
your previous experience or religious background may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;There is no charge for this introductory class, but RSVP is
required. Late admittance may be permissible (after the first week
of the class), but check with the organizer to be sure. Completion
of this series can lead into more advanced classes for those who
are interested.
 &lt;br /&gt;The class is offered on six consecutive Tuesday evenings at
7:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
