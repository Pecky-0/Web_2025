This is to ensure that you have the proper gear &amp;amp; experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Monday is a day off for me I'd like to attempt Mt. Washington on Sunday (2/15) I'm looking for at least one other hiker to join me and would love for more than one of you to join in on the fun. The only caveat is that you MUST have an Ice Axe as well as Crampons. I plan on taking the Lion Head winter route which is well travelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you're able to make it on Sunday please add your name to the &amp;quot;Waiting List&amp;quot; &amp;amp; I will contact you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet on the lower level of the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center in the Hikers Room and will start up the mountain promptly at 8 am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should the wind, weather or avalanche conditions not allow for an ascent of Washington we will hike the Carters which is close by.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like the guy in the photo --&gt;</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Milton</member_name><member_id>4294409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1234875205000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234371643000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt.
