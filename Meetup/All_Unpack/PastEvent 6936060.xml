Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Socializing for Justice at the Foggy Goggle* for the 4th Putting the Social Back in Social Justice: &amp;quot;the 1/30&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/2/0/event_2143808.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be drink and appetizer specials - 1/2 price appetizers, $7 pitchers of beer, and $12 fishbowls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;No program. No speaker. Just arrive and enjoy yourself.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're involved with a group or project and want to spread the word &lt;b&gt;bring flyers for the free lit table&lt;/b&gt; - and there'll be lots of opportunity to schmooze and network while sharing cheap pitchers of beer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sorry, this event is 21+ and the bathroom is located downstairs (no elevator). The Foggy Goggle is across from the Hynes Convention Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From our FAQs:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;It's not very easy for me to meet new people and I'm not really one for small talk at bars.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hear you. That's why at SoJust events, in addition to traditional name tags, we have &amp;quot;Ask Me About&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Looking For&amp;quot; tags. That way you can slap whatever you're into lately up on your shirt and wait for fellow SoJusters to approach you. These seem to do the trick of moving past the basic &amp;quot;what do you do for work? where do you live?&amp;quot; questions to conversations that lead to more substantial connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;What actually happens at events?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll always be greeted by friendly folks who can help get you socializing, introduce you to people, and chat with you about questions or wishes. It's likely a few people will be there promoting their campaigns and issues (&lt;i&gt;yes, SoJust welcomes that sort of behavior&lt;/i&gt;). At our bigger events, there's always a literature table to toss down flyers, postcards, and other paraphenalia about events around town. Most importantly, we can pretty much guarantee there will be someone there you've never met before. As one of our members said, &amp;quot;You are bringing together people who might never get together otherwise - if that ain't a step towards justice I don't know what is.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?&lt;/b&gt; Check out our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3187615"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/photos/"&gt;Event Photos&lt;/a&gt;.
