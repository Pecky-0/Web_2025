Now we get to see how the great Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien re-visits this classic 50 years later. &lt;b&gt;The Flight of the Red Balloon&lt;/b&gt; also features Juliette Binoche as a voice-artist for a puppet theater. I'm really looking forward to this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual screening time for this film is 1:35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Hsien's films tend to be slow, meditative works- so please don't be disappointed if this turns out not to be  The Balloon Ultimatum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flight of the Red Balloon&lt;/b&gt;  Taiwan/France 2007  114 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Le Voyage du ballon rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon), which constitutes celebrated Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien's first French-language picture, represents both an homage to Albert Lamorisse's beloved 1956 short The Red Balloon and an expansion of that earlier picture. Hsiao-Hsien begins with Lamorisse's central conceit - that of a mysterious red balloon tracking a lonely young French boy around the city - and broadens the story to weave an extended meditation on urban isolation and dysfunctional, slightly broken Parisian lives.   All Movie Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flight of the Red Balloon is in a class by itself. In its unexpected rhythms and visual surprises, its structural innovations and experimental perfs, its creative misunderstandings and its outr√© syntheses, this is a movie of genius.   The Village Voice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a children's picture, although it touches on the imaginative powers and emotional resilience of children. It's another slice of Hou's distinctly poetic realism, and as such, also a kind of tribute to Paris -- the Paris of both today and of the older film.   Premiere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mysterious red balloon affectionately follows seven-year-old Simon (Simon Iteanu) around Paris in this imaginative tale. His mother Suzanne (Juliet Binoche) is a puppeteer who uses her vocal talents to bring life to the shows she writes. Completely absorbed in her new show, Suzanne becomes overwhelmed by the complications of modern daily life, so she decides to hire Song (Song Fang), a Taiwanese film student, to help her care for Simon. Inspired by the 1956 classic, The Red Balloon. Feeling at times almost improvisatory, this first European-made film by writer/director Hou Hsiao Hsien (Flowers of Shanghai, Millennium Mambo) is a poetic delight.
