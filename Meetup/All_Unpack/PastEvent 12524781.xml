We will have to buy the tickets ahead of time instead of the way that we were going to get them that I said below.  I can do this no problem so if you do plan on coming please send me an email: msdondon2003@yahoo.com confirming that you will be attending.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to get the discount price we need to put this on 1 card and I will need to call the arena by 11:00 Friday/tomorrow morning then I will call and give them the credit card information and they will hold the tickets in my name.  Then when we get there you can pay me ($11.00), and I will give you your ticket.  So please send me an email confirming that you are coming OR change your RSVP on the site, thanks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to buy your ticket at the door you can but you will have to go to the box office and get them that is pretty close to the arena!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO MEETUP: Still to the right as you come in the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING: There is a parking garage right near the arena, and parking is only $5.00.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s go watch the Lowell Devils play again the Providence Bruins at the Tsongas Center in Lowell, MA the Lowell Devils hockey games are more than just a exciting night of hockey this night it will be a fun packed Singles Night right there at the arena in Lowell, MA. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the highlights of the night will be: Player bobble head giveaway that evening for the first 2,000 fans.  All who attend for Singles Night will sit in the Singles section (which is already blocked off and available only to those attending) so we can network and have fun with all the other singles attending.  There will be raffle tickets included with the game tickets (only for the Singles Night attendees) for a couple of local restaurants and Devils merchandise/autographed memorabilia.  They will have great music, entertaining contests, on this night they will also have a dance-off, nuttiest row contest, sweetheart of the game and lucky column, dance performances by their Ice Crew at intermission, chuck-a-puck, t-shirt tosses and more.  There are concession stands where you can get food and drinks, and our mascot Devil Dawg is always in the crowd making things interesting. It really is a fun, different night out.  This should be a fun packed event and we get to network/mix and mingle with other singles all while we watch the hockey game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will need a head count ahead a few days before the event we will call in the amount of tickets, which they will hold for us and waiting under my name.  If your plans change PLEASE update your RSVP ahead of time so we are not holding a ticket for you if you are not able to attend and taking a seat/ticket that someone else may want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ticket’s price &amp;amp; information:&lt;/b&gt; $11.00 (Normally $18.00) When we get to the table we can all pay separately for our ticket, please note that ONLY cash or check will be accepted (since they won’t have a phone line set up for the credit card machine).
