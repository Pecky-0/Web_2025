&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Come join me for a Lollypop (loop) hike from QUabbin Gate 29 out to Rattlesnake Hill to take in the views then around the ledges out to some old dirt cart roads with scenic areas of the Quabbin. We'll take a trail from the cart roads which leads closer to the water and empties out into a large field near the Quabbin before heading back on the same road we started on(only much further down near the water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;I think we measured this out at approximately 6 miles but I do have a horrible memory so don't hold me to that;-).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quabbin Gate 29, rt 202, New Salem, MA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking loop trails to other gates. Historical sites, birdwatching, and views of the Quabbin. No pets, please. &lt;br /&gt;

 Description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates 29 and 30 both end up on the same paved road, but Gate 30 also crosses the lovely, stone-arched Keystone Bridge, built by hand in 1866 to span the Middle Branch of the Swift River. From the bridge a fisherman’s trail leads east along the river to the Quabbin Reservoir. Along the approximately 2½-mile main trail are many cellar holes, echoes of the lost section of New Salem, and varied habitats—woodland, edge, and open field—leading to the shores of the Quabbin. One side trails allows a loop hike that exits at Gate 28, with the last leg along Rte. 122; another connects with Gate 27 near New Salem center; and a third makes a steep climb up Rattlesnake Hill to a magnificent view of the reservoir. Consult a map or guidebook for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;Directions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;From Rte. 2, take Exit 16 and go south on Rte. 202. Turn left on Rte. 122; Gate 30 is a few hundred yards further on the right. (Gate 29 is a short way further south on Rte. 202, on the left.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the local forecast for tomorrow. Please dress accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
