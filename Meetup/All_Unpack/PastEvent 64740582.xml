Grafton), Jay Cohen. He is happy to have our group meet at 3pm at his farm on August 11. We can meet at the library and whoever wants to go, we can carpool from there. The farm is only 3 or so miles from the library. He said that he would have yarn available for us as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bit of a climb up a hill to the homestead and store and he would recommend that the ladies wear comfortable shoes for the climb. If there are some who can't make the climb he said he'd be happy to bring the alpacas to the folks at the bottom of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have the room available at the library to whoever wants to just sit and knit.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandra Cipriani</member_name><member_id>10013774</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344766528000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Knitters and stitchers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1389430</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6500015259</group_lon><name>Knitting &amp; Needlework in the Boroughs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337013167000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Knitting &amp; Needlework</name><id>64740582</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344708000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group/events/64740582/</event_url></item>
