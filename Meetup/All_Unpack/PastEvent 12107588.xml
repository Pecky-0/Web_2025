Using a profoundly transformational system of sound healing that incorporates the use of planetary gongs, Tibetan singing bowls and Acutonic tuning forks, the concert harmonizes the sounds of our universe through vibration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound and vibration re-awaken a deep appreciation for the whole body even on a cellular level. Resonance is a critical concept in understanding the impact of sound on the physical body. It is defined as an echo, a continuation of ringing. It is the quality of one vibrating &lt;br /&gt;body as it reaches out and sets another body into motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sounds of gongs and Tibetan bowls vibrate the energy in the chakras and meridians clearing blockages allowing our life force to flow freely. Also affecting us in a transformative way, tuning forks provide a method of attunement or synchronization between the rhythm of the forks and the rhythms of our subtle energy bodies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join &lt;a href="http://www.gongtheplanet.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Conduit &lt;/a&gt;and others as we meditate and connect with the sacredness of the universe through sound and vibration. A $20 donation goes to support the work of The Conduit and the Growing Green Co-op's healing arts space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Green Vibration Members receive a 10% discount and a free sauna session after the concert!
