I may also adjust the exact meeting location once I map out our route.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to discourage anyone but this is a challenging hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not hesitate to join if you like to push yourself physically. The goal is not to beat anyone else but to challenge and push yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will plan to cover about 7 miles in a few hours. This will require us to hike at a steady fast pace with some jogging (running) when possible. We will plan for one, maybe 2 breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email me if you have any questions at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage people to sign up, but I would like to emphasis that it is not a walk in the park.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270519641000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269295087000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MIddlesex Fells Skyline hike - fast pace</name><id>12961004</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270301400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/12961004/</event_url></item>
