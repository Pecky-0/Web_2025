I'm talking a lot of 8's and 9's and a few 10's. This has to be a regular place to go to. I will invite as many girls as I can for social proof so we can all forwards and backwards merge. Bring girls with you guys too if you can and if not that's cool too we want to try and take the ranch over this night lol! This is a country bar so dress western in a flashy way. I'm gonna be going with a flashy belt buckle, cowboy boots, cowboy shirt, and cowboy hat. The hats are excellent when it comes to locking in. This is going to be a great night filled with fun and girls. Let's be good wings to each other and follow the wing rules because I will be posting them up as a reminder to everyone. This will be a fun awesome night to look forward to and I hope to see you all there fellas!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in a Cowboy Hat, black western shirt, and have red hair</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282029171000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226682552000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cadillac Ranch Sarge!</name><id>9162631</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227405600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/9162631/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/3/5/global_6182869.jpeg</photo_url></item>
