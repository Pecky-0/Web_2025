&lt;p&gt;Meet in the parking area at 10:30 Travel to this area by following Route 62 east from Concord Center toward Bedford. After about one mile, turn left onto Monsen Road. Continue on Monsen Road until you see the refuge entrance on your left. Drive slowly, the entrance looks like a driveway and is easy to miss!  Need a ride? Please ask for one in your rsvp, saying what area you are in.  Dogs (or domestic animals of any kind) are not allowed on the refuge.  This original 250-acre area that belonged to Samuel Hoar is still known as the 'Great Meadows,' and is open to visitors. Several trails are available for wildlife observation, including the Dike Trail, a 2.7-mile loop around one of the marsh pools. Trailside interpretive signs and an observation tower provide visitors with additional views and information about the refuge, its management, and its wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303573306000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1303174361000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Meadows walk</name><id>17353365</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303569000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/17353365/</event_url></item>
