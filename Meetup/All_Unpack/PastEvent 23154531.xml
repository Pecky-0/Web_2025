Because of this, it is imperative to catapult Ron Paul to victory in the straw poll, and defeat his fellow competitors, including Mitt Romney, who won the straw poll in 2007. On July 19, 2011, we will hold an online money bomb in support of Ron Paul for President 2012, with the goal to win the Ames, Iowa straw poll. A money bomb i...s a 24-hour fundraising event aimed at dramatically increasing funds for a specific candidate. In November 2007, Ron Paul raised more than $4.2 million in a single day. In December 2007, Ron Paul raised the most money in the history of American politics in a single day, raising more than $6 million; a record that still holds strong to this very day. More recently, Ron Paul raised $1 million on May 5, 2011. in a time when most Americans aren't concerned with politics. Please invite your friends, and tell them that it is essential that we all donate to Ron Paul at RonPaul2012.com on July 19, 2011, in preparation for the Ames, Iowa Straw poll in August 2011. The money bomb will be held on Ron Paul's official campaign website, which you can find at &lt;a href="http://www.RonPaul2012.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.RonPaul201...&lt;/a&gt;.
