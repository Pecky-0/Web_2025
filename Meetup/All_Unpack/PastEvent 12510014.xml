You will learn a technique known as “crossweaving” which is so gorgeous and easy, that you will want to make this piece in all different colors, over and over again. You will be able to leave class with a finished bracelet.

Class lasts two hours, and materials are not included in the price.

Materials:
Please come 15-20 minutes early to make your selections.
2 colors of “main beads” – Swarovski or other 4mm bicones, druks (round beads) 6mm or smaller, all work well.  (100, 4mm beads or 75, 6mm beads will give you more than enough to make the bracelet).
150 coordinating cube beads (optional)
2 tube size 11/0 seed beads
clasp
2 wire guardians
size 10 needle, wax, scissors and fireline thread available for use during class
