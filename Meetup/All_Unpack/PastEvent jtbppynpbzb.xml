<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The only person to reply for Friday wants to see the new &amp;quot;Harry Potter&amp;quot; movie, and since a couple other people have posted in an Idea that they want to see it, I've chosen that for Friday.  The evening showtimes at Bow Tie Criterion Cinemas at Blue Back Square are  6:05, 6:55, 9:15, and 10:00 - to keep with the preset time of this Meetup I chose the 6:55pm time and hopefully you can still buy tickets at 6:15-30pm.  I may not be able to be there that much earlier so buy your tickets and wait by the tables to gather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also reopened the RSVPs, Smitha had that set to close three days ahead of the event.  See below for the regular meetup details.  Everybody has to buy your own ticket or arrange for someone to buy it for you, the organizers do NOT buy tickets for the group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering may be I should try something a little different than picking a movie or a restaurant and force it on everyone as a movie meetup. So I am going to post a recurring meetup occurs every third Friday and request all of you to suggest interested movie names and any fun activities that you would like to do with the rest of the group. You can provide your suggestions as a comment in your RSVP. Fun activities can be dinner, happy hour, drinks, current events, shopping, movie discussions or any other interesting activities suitable for this group at the time. I will choose the most popular suggestions for that specific week and update everyone on the exact plans closer to the actual date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really appreciate all of your feedback and suggestions for each month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For parking options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bluebacksquare.com/parking/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bluebacksq...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bluebacksquare.com/directions/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bluebacksq...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send detailed information closer to each event.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290267653000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284331735000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Harry Potter" for Movies and Fun on Fridays!</name><id>jtbppynpbzb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290208500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/14855930/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/1/3/global_16960115.jpeg</photo_url></item>
