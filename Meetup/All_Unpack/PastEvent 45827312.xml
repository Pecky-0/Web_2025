&lt;p&gt;I'm not one to go out on New Year's Eve, and was just waiting for the forecast to see if the weather was going to hold out for this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potluck and Bonfire (should be possible since it is going to rain Friday into Saturday, then clear up)&amp;nbsp; I won't know until 5pm on the bonfire, but we can still do the potluck and party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring an appetizer, or healthy munchy to share.&amp;nbsp; Maybe some can bring sweets, but I'd rather the good stuff.&amp;nbsp; I'm trying to watch my sugar and cholesterol...lol.&amp;nbsp; lately I've been watching it go up...water and soda will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please park on my side of the street only.&amp;nbsp; Bring an outdoor chair, and some slippers for inside, so my floors aren't a total disaster, when everyone leaves ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BYOB and if you drink too much, I will be calling AAA, they are offering a free "tipsy tow" and ride to anyone who needs it, or I'll get you where you're going myself.&amp;nbsp; If you don't come, but want to save the number here it is 1-800-222-4357.&amp;nbsp; I don't have any plans on drinking, other than a champagne toast (I have one bottle, if anyone would like to bring another)&amp;nbsp; Bring a sleeping bag, if you think it will be necessary ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the whole family coming over for New Year's day, so I'm going to have to ask everyone to be out by 1-1:30am the latest.&amp;nbsp; I'll need my rest...lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love to bring in the New Year with my very good friends, don't know if I'll make the dance on Friday, as it is supposed to snow, and I'm a real chicken in the snow.&amp;nbsp; Plus I've got a full weekend.&amp;nbsp; Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugs and a Happy, Healthy, Safe and Prosperous New Year to you all,&lt;/p&gt;
