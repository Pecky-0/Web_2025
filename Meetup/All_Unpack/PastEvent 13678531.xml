It will be an experiential exploration -- inviting participants to investigate their present experience directly.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can the inner noise be entirely left alone while attending? When the changing states of body-mind are simply left to themselves without any choice or judgment — left unreacted to by a controlling or repressive will — a new quietness emerges by itself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kieran was a staff member at Springwater Center for Meditative Inquiry and Retreats (springwatercenter.org) in western NY from 2002-2008 -- a unique center with an emphasis on direct meditative inquiry into one's moment-to-moment experience. Prior to Springwater, he was involved with a number of different Buddhist communities, always with eclectic Buddhist and non-Buddhist interests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope that you, friends, and family will join us this Friday night at 6:30 for meditation followed by our Chinese, vegan buffet at 7:00 pm and the presentation at 7:45 pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost (Include dinner) &lt;br /&gt;Adult: $10 Student: $5 (student ID required)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CASH ONLY.
