And what is it that’s tearing us apart?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.J. Dionne’s new book, Our Divided Political Heart: The Battle for the American Idea in an Age of Discontent (Bloomsbury USA, 2012), argues that from the very beginning, our country has been characterized by a deep but healthy tension between our love of individual liberty and our devotion to community. On May 29, The Brookings Institution hosted a discussion with E. J. Dionne about the lost balance between individualism and community and the corrosive implications for the political environment and policy-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us on July 7, 2012, at 2:30 p.m. at 700 Hartford Turnpike in Hamden when we’ll watch this webcast in which Dionne talks about his book and follows up with lengthy answers to audience questions. We can discuss our own questions and answers over refreshments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshments will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
