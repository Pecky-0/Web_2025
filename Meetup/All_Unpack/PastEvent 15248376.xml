<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>An overall moderate hike of 7 to 8 miles in no more than 5.5 hours on the Chatfield Trail which is partially in the Cockaponset State Forest south of Rte. 80 and Chatfield Hollow State Park.  Some climbs, some views, some caves too (at far point)! Hike is mostly an out-and-back style with some veriation and looping. Length of hike will be adjusted to ensure we return to cars in no more than 5 hours. We go slower, we don't go out as far on the Chatfield Trail. This means we are back to the cars no later than 2:30 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well meet at 9 AM at the parking area in Chatfield Hollow State Park just inside the park entrance (see park hiking map below). There should also be parking for 6 cars on the south side of Rt. 80 at the trailhead. We will walk across Rte. 80 to trailhead and begin our adventure. We will follow the blue trail (Chatfield Trail), descend to base of 40' cliff, scramble through glacial boulders and crevasses and under overhangs. we'll then loop around on the alternate orange/blue trail and then back to the blue trail. Then we hike by and over various ledges, cliffs, and boulders to no further than Papermill Rd. and return staying completely on the blue trail. How far we go towards Papermill Rd. depends on how we are doing for time (turning point is no later than about 2.5 hours out). We'll have some different sights on the way back as we won't use the alternate trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to eat out somewhere after the hike if the group feels like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to bring 1 - 2 Qts. water and a trail snack for pep. This is a popular park so parking may be limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In pre-Colonial times, Indians frequented the valley in considerable numbers for purposes of fishing and hunting. Many artifacts found in the vicinity of Indian Council Caves indicated that Native Americans sought refuge in the jagged ledges and held tribal gatherings amid the rock recesses and overhangs. An Indian trail paralleled the brook, winding through the trees and along what is now the park road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate location/directions to Chatfield Hollow State Park parking area (eastern entrance near 381 Route 80, Killingworth, CT):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?l=41.365039&amp;amp;g=-72.584251" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(approximate lat=41.365039, long=-72.584251)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Partial hiking map&lt;/b&gt; (shows only north end of Chatfield Trail at Rte. 80 we will hike):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/stateparks/maps/chatfieldhollow.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chatfield Trail map&lt;/b&gt; can be found on &lt;b&gt;page 87, Map CH-1&lt;/b&gt; in the current 19th ed. &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;Connecticut Walk Book East&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; by the Connecticute Forest and Parks Association.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topographic map of the area centered roughly on the trailhead on Rte. 80.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trails.com/topo.aspx?panerror=true&amp;amp;z=18&amp;amp;e=701660.911225767&amp;amp;n=4582020.06415156&amp;amp;s=50&amp;amp;size=s&amp;amp;style=drgsr" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trails.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;More information on Chatfield Hollow State Park&lt;/b&gt; (includes general directions)&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&amp;amp;q=325182&amp;amp;depNav_GID=1650" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children are welcome on this hike.
