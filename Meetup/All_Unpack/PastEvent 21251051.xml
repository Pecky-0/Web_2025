&lt;p&gt;Update to venue - due to Pinkerton Tavern closing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to meet at the Homestead Restaurant in Merrimack. It's in the building where Silo's Steakhouse used to be and is right on the DW highway off of Exit 12 (if you're heading north on the Everett Turnpike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey folks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry this scheduler has taken so long to get out there. I was out of commission with severe strep throat for the last week and change. We originally were going to meet on June 22, but given the size of the book and the lateness of this email, I'm going to push it out to July 20. So, this will serve as both our June and July meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be reading The Help by Kathryn Stockett. This is a pretty hot book right now from everything I've heard and the reviews are very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come join us on July 20 at the Pinkerton Tavern (an old favorite of the group) for a drink, good conversation, the Pinkerton's awesome Mac and Cheese. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm bumping the limit to 16 for this one since it's combining June and July. But, as always, if you do RSVP Yes and need to bow out, please update your RSVP asap so someone can join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
