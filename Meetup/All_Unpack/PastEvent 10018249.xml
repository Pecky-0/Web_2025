I was pleasantly surprised at the great singers we have and the variety of music we enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are back to the Courtside Restaurant and Pub for April.  I decided to post the date earlier than usual so everyone can get this into their calendars now, especially as the weather gets warmer.  Please try to join us if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This venue has the best song selection in all of Boston.  They have an extensive song collection including rock, pop, rap, country, show tunes, soul, alternative bands, jazz, etc.  Over 40,000 songs in all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The room's acoustics are good and they have state of the art equipment with multiple monitors throughout.  Definitely a great place to perform or enjoy listening to others perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are a Karaoke enthusiast, we welcome you to join us and sing your heart out.  The cost will be $10.00 for all those who want to sing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Karaoke and are not sure you want to sing yet, please join us anyway.  There is no pressure to sing if you would rather listen.  The cost will be only $5.00 for spectators.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you all again in April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Phil&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask for me or call me at 617-429-6571</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Philip L</member_name><member_id>1522860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1249164729000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonkaraoke</urlname><id>212993</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237839814000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup for April 2009</name><id>10018249</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240700400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonkaraoke/events/10018249/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/4/global_7069268.jpeg</photo_url></item>
