Mondays are usually mellow so we should be able to get in plenty of climbing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. For more information see: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there - this is my first meetup as an assistant organizer so don't leave me hangin'!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wait at the picnic table until 7:45; after that, you'll find me climbing.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin</member_name><member_id>4202767</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214437100000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213927918000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Climbing @ Metro</name><id>8176838</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214263800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8176838/</event_url></item>
