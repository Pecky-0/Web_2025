(NHCers Courtney, Sandra, Meghan and Dana are members of SI.) Currently one of their key focus areas is working to stop human trafficking. The New Haven chapter of SI will be presenting a stage reading of the very powerful play &amp;quot;Body &amp;amp; Sold.&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;This play tells the stories of 10 American kids who are victims of sex trafficking.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the characters are fictional, the play is closely based on interviews of actual victims in the U.S. This play really puts a face on trafficking victims and helps to remind us that this is not just a global crisis, it's a local crisis too. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Hartford was one of the cities the playwright visited to conduct her interviews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We hope you'll come to help raise awareness about this very important issue. We guarantee you'll be moved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NHC'er Sandra will be the contact for this event; she will put contact info in her RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric</member_name><member_id>2576129</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227640631000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226463677000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Body and Sold," a Documentary Play about Human Trafficking</name><id>9145225</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227466800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9145225/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
