We haven't been walking with the group because for a dog who likes consistency and familiarity, it's hard to meet new friends every week or so...  so we are going to try again, but this time I am asking for large breed dogs only, please.  Our trainer feels that Isabelle is not dog aggressive, however she is totally rude and acts inappropriatly with small dogs and puppies, and most other dogs!  I want her to be able to meet and make friends with dogs her own size so she is not scared and cannot scare others.  It is also important that she meet confident, easy going dogs.  If you are willing to help us out a little and have some patience with impolite behavior and training, we would love to meet with you for a walk around the park.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derryfield has a large field I thought we could do a lap or two around.  Maybe even play around a little.  This is a strictly on leash walk, and if you don't know Isabelle already, she really needs support and a firm but understanding attitude during her training.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a casual meetup, but also a training session.  We will be focusing on greeting appropriatly by sniffing, so you can't be embarassed by this very appropriate manner of meeting.  We will be taking our time so that the dogs can get comfortable with each other, the focus will be on socializing, not just walking.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a large dog, more than 65 lbs or so (Isabelle is 84lbs), who is kind and patient and playful, we would really like to meet with you, hopefully on a weekly basis.  If you would like to join us but can't make it this night, please let me know, we are flexible.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Near the pavillion in the middle of the park</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>melissa </member_name><member_id>7279035</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243706609000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242607448000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Big Dog Meet Up</name><id>10433877</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243377900000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10433877/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/d/global_8675469.jpeg</photo_url></item>
