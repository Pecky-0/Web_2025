(www.bostonbyfoot.org) The cost is normally $12 but I will have discount tickets for $10. The tour will take us from the statue of Samuel Adams in front of Faneuil Hall to the Blackstone Block, edging by the Haymarket vendors, through the Greenway and finally, into the North End. We will learn much about the history, geography and sociology of this area. The tour will end at 2:30 in North Square, near the Paul Revere House. At that time we will go to lunch at a North End restaurant. Please be at the Adams statue by 12:45 to meet other NEEM members and to pay for the tickets. The tour leaves promptly at 1:00. Your RSVP is for the tour. Lunch is optional. These events will happen rain or shine. It should be a fun and interesting afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be at a bench on the right of the statue, as you face Faneuil Hall</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>6</waitlist_count><updated>1245973810000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244036349000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North End Walking Tour + Lunch</name><id>10564803</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244912400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/10564803/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/a/global_7834474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
