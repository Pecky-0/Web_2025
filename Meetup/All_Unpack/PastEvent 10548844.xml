Boston By Foot, Inc. and the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Conservancy are pleased to announce a series of guided walking tours of the Greenway. We invite you to join us on the third Thursday of every month (June-September) to learn more about the Greenway, a new mile-long civic parkland, created where an elevated highway once divided Bostonâ€™s communities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway is an admired and beloved public park system that is reflective of the diversity, unity and spirit that increasingly defines Boston and the Commonwealth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot&lt;/a&gt; guides and explore the Greenway parks, development parcels, and changes along the Greenway's edge.  As the centerpiece of the Big Dig's urban restoration, we will discuss how the Greenway is changing the way residents and visitors experience and interact with the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take a tour, simply show up! No reservations are required but a maximum of sixty people can comfortably walk together and hear the guides. The tour is $10* and will be held held rain or shine. We will walk from the North End through to Chinatown, approximately 1 mile.   (*please note: the tour fee is applicable to Boston By Foot members and docents.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Boston By Foot badges, bags, hats, etc.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251657517000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243897255000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rose Kennedy Greenway: From The North End to Chinatown </name><id>10548844</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250805600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/10548844/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/d/global_8934637.jpeg</photo_url></item>
