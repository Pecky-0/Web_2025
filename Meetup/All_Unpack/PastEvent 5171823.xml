<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the &amp;quot;almost end of the season&amp;quot; Sailing Meetup. As the group is now growing, we want to get your input and ideas on locations, topics, speakers, etc. Please come by and help to shape the future of the group. In addition, we always like to hear your cruising or racing stories, sailing plans, dream boat, and tales of adventure on the high seas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. For a mini-meetup, I will be at the Boston In-Water Boat Show on September 30 and October 1 in the Hunter booth on the water. Stop by to say hi!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 16327</member_name><member_id>16327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1163115365000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1159918470000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Sailing November Meetup</name><id>5171823</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1162942200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/5171823/</event_url></item>
