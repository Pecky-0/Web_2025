This    game is intended to be approximately Yankee C level or   equivalent.    Players are required to know how to play a 6-2 and 5-1   formation.     INSTRUCTIONS: Because this game requires players to know   formations, the    RSVP procedure is a little different. If you'd like   to play, please  do   the following:  1. Send an email to the organizer   (Ted) using the    following URL: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=7699532" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=7699532&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the   email, confirm that you know how to play in a 5-1 or 6-2    offense, and   mention your preferred position (if any). 2. Players will    be added to   the list to fill up positions. Preference is given to    Yankee C or above   players (or equivalent), and people who have not    been no-shows at   previous meetups. There is a strict cap at 12 players    to make sure   everyone gets lots of playing time. Note that sending   an  email does not   guarantee a spot to play; spots are only  guaranteed  if  you are assigned  a  Yes RSVP.  The cost of the meetup  will be $5.   Please pay the  organizer  when you arrive before the  meetup starts.  The  money goes to  cover the  cost of the court rental.   The entrance  to  the gym is on  Cambridge  Street opposite Harvard  Market. The  nearest  intersection to  the entrance  is Cambridge Street  and Roberts  Road. The  nearest T stop  is Harvard  Square. The gym is  about a ten  minute walk  from the T stop.   Parking  near the school on  Sundays is  generally easy  to find, as  meters and  residential  parking rules are  generally not  enforced on  Sundays (parking  signs  should say "EX  SUNDAY" or similar).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>ted foss</member_name><member_id>7699532</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305486957000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304889561000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Advanced Indoor Volleyball</name><id>17630571</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1305482400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/17630571/</event_url></item>
