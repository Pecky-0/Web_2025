All are welcome to join. The water is still cold so drysuits and wetsuits are recommended. Tuesday nights are &amp;quot;informal&amp;quot; skills sessions. You can work on whatever you choose. You can ask for help from the experienced paddlers there, or offer something up that we all might learn from....you don't have to be an expert kayaker to share experience. (I actually learned to roll successfully from someone who had only paddled twice, but he could see my problem because he had read some books!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should have at a minimum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boat&lt;br /&gt;Paddle&lt;br /&gt;PFD (which you must wear and zip when on the water with us)&lt;br /&gt;Paddle float&lt;br /&gt;Pump&lt;br /&gt;Wet or Drysuit (until at least mid-May)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Great Pond:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Pond is located in Kingston, NH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We launch at the State Boat Ramp on Main St. in Kingston.
