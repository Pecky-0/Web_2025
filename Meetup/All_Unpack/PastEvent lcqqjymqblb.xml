<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We'll be having a meeting in December to finish business&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our own CFII Pete Coolidge and CFI Gary Rabidou will go over how they train their students on weather briefing. What they use and how they use it. Maybe we can call wx brief as well and speaker phone them for a theoretical flight the following day.&lt;br /&gt;This should go well with the time of year. Icing and winds are a factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't let your plane sit there empty and not flying. &lt;br /&gt;We'll also talk about partnerships and clubs. There are a number of people with planes available for sale or partnerships on the field. Expenses are split and flying is much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FCA is always looking to do a leaseback with someone with a 4 seater. Talk with Dick at the FCA about this if you are interested. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Fly Often and Fly Safe.&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, food at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where else can you have this much excitement for $25 bucks a year?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fly Often and Fly Safe, &lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260486404000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257897858000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association EAA Chapter 1454 December Meetup</name><id>lcqqjymqblb</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260313200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/11845711/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/3/global_11324067.jpeg</photo_url></item>
