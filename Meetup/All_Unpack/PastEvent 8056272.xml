Playing at dusk is not safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: Joe, Jim, and I just spent an hour replacing batteries in the lanyards.  They still stink, but at least now they're a bright and shiny stinky.  And the discs have new batteries too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same deal as always: We'll meet around &lt;b&gt;8:30&lt;/b&gt;, throw around for a bit while we learn each other's names, then split up into teams and play ultimate. After the game, we'll go out and socialize at Uno's, Herrell's, or some other place around Harvard. Before attending our events, please review our About Us page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd recommend you bring a light-colored shirt for visibility's sake and a change of clothes. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, lanyards, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Please consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our Amazon Wishlist to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your optional donations are certainly appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Kelli and Mat&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're the crazy group throwing Frisbees at night</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mat</member_name><member_id>3297748</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelli</member_name><member_id>4908325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213105649000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><why>Throwing Frisbees at night is surprisingly fun</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212357738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuesday Frisbee</name><id>8056272</id><headcount>42</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212539400000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/8056272/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/3/global_4300723.jpeg</photo_url></item>
