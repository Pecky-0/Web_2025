Belle toujours is a homage, a parody and also a lovely meditation (by a director well into his 90's) on the passage of time and the persistence of desire.&amp;quot; (The New York Times). The film has received mixed reviews. French with English subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MFA members, seniors, and students $8; general admission $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is being hosted by Nicole, your friendly meetup organizer, who will be holding a sign toward the front of the theater during the credits.
