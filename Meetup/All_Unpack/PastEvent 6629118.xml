It was a pleasure to meet everyone. We talked about the next dinner excursion and we thought we would try a Japanese restaurant this time. I was thinking it also might be fun to get a private room and sit on the floor. Most places now have a hole in the floor so your not sitting with your legs crossed. I know there are some good Japanese restaurants in West Haven or if anyone would like to suggest a good place, that would be great.  I'll chose a place within the next 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,  &lt;br /&gt;Kathy&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196726663000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193531903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The New Haven Dining Out November Meetup</name><id>6629118</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196553600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/6629118/</event_url></item>
