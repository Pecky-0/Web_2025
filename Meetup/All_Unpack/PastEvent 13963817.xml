I'd love to host a night paddle on Thursday, July 8 beginning around 6:00 p.m. I'm in a great location, plenty of parking, great put in and a grill to BBQ after the paddle. If you've never paddled Bow Lake before and want to join us in July, let me know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Route 4 W: &lt;br /&gt;From Spaulding Turnpike, take exit 6W onto Rte. 4W toward Durham/Concord, Stay on Rte. 4 to Lee Traffic Circle, continue on Rte 4 for 14.1 miles, turn right onto BOW LAKE ROAD, go .7 miles, Bow Lake Road curves to the left at a big rock, Simpson Lane is approximately 1.4 miles on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Route 4 E: &lt;br /&gt;From Epsom Traffic Circle, travel 8.1 miles, turn left onto BOW LAKE ROAD, go .7 miles, Bow Lake Road curves to the left at a big rock, Simpson Lane is approximately 1.4 miles on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on Simpson Lane, you can park in the large parking area.
