&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff ; font-size : large"&gt; Fidelity's Chip McLetchie on Fidelity Stock Screeners and Trading Tools &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fidelity has recently updated and revamped its website and sports a number of recent changes that include new analytical tools and allows for advanced screening of stocks and options.  We have asked Fidelity to send a representative to present and demonstrate some of these new features to Boston investors and trades.   Chip McLetchie&lt;/span&gt; will be highlighting Fidelity's advanced option screening and analytical tools. including stock screeners, LIVEVOL strategy ideas, option scans and Fidelity's new&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; probability calculator. A few weeks ago at MIT, we had a speaker from the company that developed and is marketing Live Vol to the retail investor. We discovered that most of the Live Vol features are available for free to anyone with a funded Fidelity account. Mr. McLetchie will be available to demonstrate any features and answer questions about the Fidelity platform that attendees are interested in seeing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chip McLetchie is a regional brokerage consultant for Fidelity Investments. He started his career with Fidelity as a financial representative and quickly moved to Active Trader Services, where he supported their more advanced platforms such as Wealth Lab Pro and Options Trader Pro. In 2007, Mr. McLetchie moved to Active Trader Sales, where he supported the New York and New Jersey regions. As a Regional Brokerage Consultant Mr. McLetchie helps educate Fidelity employee's and their clients in regards to Fidelity  brokerage offerings. Mr. McLetchie graduated from Bates College in 2004 with a degree in Economics and is currently finishing his MBA at Northeastern University in Boston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
