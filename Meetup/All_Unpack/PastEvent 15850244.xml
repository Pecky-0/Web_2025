<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>this has been a long time coming! December was far too busy and even Jan is looking less busy but still busy! Sorry it took me so long to think and then post this one, and it's kinda short notice!!  As long as there's no sicknesses or more blizzards this day- it's on!! Bring your 2011 spirit and leftover bubbly if you have it and let's ring the new year in with some euchre style!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll have that garlicky hummus and dipping things and salsa.  Bring something else if you'd like.  &lt;br /&gt;see you then!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mindy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mindy</member_name><member_id>4498017</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294535627000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Euchre Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>euchre-262</urlname><id>1040200</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North of Boston Euchre Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293648397000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>the 1st 2011 Euchre meetup- it's about time for another!</name><id>15850244</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294531200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euchre-262/events/15850244/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/global_3408104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
