According to &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=PROVSTOU&amp;amp;direction=O&amp;amp;timing=S&amp;amp;RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time" target="_blank"&gt;the MBTA schedule&lt;/a&gt;, there's a Commuter Rail train that gets to Providence at 5:50pm on Saturday evenings, so that should fit good with this.  The next train doesn't come in until 7:50.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dinner, we will walk along the river and hopefully find a not-so-crowded spot away from the mall to sit close to the river.  There is usually some entertainment and food carts along the way, and sometimes even some freebies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you taking the commuter rail, &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=PROVSTOU&amp;amp;direction=I&amp;amp;timing=S&amp;amp;RedisplayTime=Redisplay+Time" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA trains leave Providence &lt;/a&gt;at 7:52pm and 10pm.  There also appears to be a few later trains if you want to take &lt;a href="http://www.amtrak.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm not sure about the bus routes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fires are lit by boat at sundown, and according to the website they stay lit until midnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxdetail/USRI0050?dayNum=2" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the weather forecast.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget your camera! :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Food court - I'll email my cell # to the Yes &amp; Maybe RSVPs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249160197000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247367922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterfire in Providence</name><id>10856305</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248559200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/10856305/</event_url></item>
