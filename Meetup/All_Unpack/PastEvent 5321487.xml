Thanks to all for attending!  That fulfills my &amp;quot;contractual obligations&amp;quot; to CWPN.   Alice, David, and Kaity are invited to attend the Yule gathering at my Hartford home on the evening of Thursday, Dec 21.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00pm - gather, socialize, eat, drink, etc.&lt;br /&gt;7:00pm - pre-ritual discussion&lt;br /&gt;7:30pm - blot (formal ritual)&lt;br /&gt;8:30pm - husel (feasting)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may or not be a sumbel later in the evening, depending on the number of people, the lateness of the hour, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I am extending this invitation to those people on this list that I have already met, OR, to those who make arrangements to meet me for a quick cup of coffee before the 21st.  I regret if that offends anyone, but I'm not comfortable opening my home to just anybody sight unseen.  We need some face time in a public setting first.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, just ask.  :)&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Hicks</member_name><member_id>3427608</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1167080361000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Followers of Asatru</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>asatru-242</urlname><id>369297</id><group_lat>41.8600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut &amp; Western Mass Asatru Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1165885509000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Asatru Yule Meetup</name><id>5321487</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1166742000000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/asatru-242/events/5321487/</event_url></item>
