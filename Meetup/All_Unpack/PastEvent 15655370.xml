Also Mark Wahlberg in lots of scenes sans shirt....very yummy!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I get to the theater an hour before the movie starts and the group heads in for seats 30 minutes before show time.    If you miss the group before hand, we will gather outside the room where the film was showing to discuss the movie a bit, allow for restroom breaks and get a head count for all those who are interested in getting drinks and munchies after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a meetup pin and have a meetup sign.  If the movie is showing upstairs, I will grab a table by the windows at the top of the escalator, it if is showing downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: December 10, 2010 (limited; wide release: Dec. 17) &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Paramount Pictures &lt;br /&gt;Director: David O.
