&lt;p&gt;The movie originally planned for this Meetup will have to be changed to "Iron Man 3" because "The Company You Keep" has been removed from the cinema's schedule. (Sigh.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Meetup will gather together to see "Iron Man 3" at the AMC Cinema in Framingham. (I will admit I've been sucked into this and find the "Iron Man" franchise to be really fun and entertaining, and they seem to be very committed to continuing to make and release these wild, action-packed movies, so I'm going along with it….)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** NOTE: This Meetup will gather a little earlier than displayed in the original posting -- it's now 6:45 p.m. ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to plan to go to the 7:15 p.m. showing. We'll meet 30 minutes early because this is one of the summer blockbusters and I'm guessing it's going to be very busy at the theatre and the showing may even sell out. (Or the craziness may have died out completely and it will be really quiet, I have no idea.) So we'll start gathering about 6:30 or so and promptly at 6:45 I'll take a count of who is there and get in line for tickets. (If it does indeed sell out, you can either leave, go see what you want at a later time, or we'll fall back to seeing "42" which is currently scheduled to start at 7 p.m.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet in the first (interior) lobby, to the right of the ticket counter. I will be wearing a small "Meet Up" badge. I will have discount tickets that will cost $8 per person. Exact change is helpful. After the movie, anyone who wishes to can go out to a local restaurant together to talk or to discuss the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to update your RSVP if your plans change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel's "Iron Man 3" pits brash-but-brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, will test his mettle at every turn. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?&lt;/p&gt;
