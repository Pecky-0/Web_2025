Bekyung was told by his teacher to go into society and “return the light” by teaching SunDo to the people who would listen. In 1979, after training with Be-Kyung for many years, Hyunmoon Kim brought SunDo-Taoist practice to the West. A PhD graduate of Philosophy in Human Science, Master Kim integrates contemporary western psychology with ancient eastern wisdom to teach the principles of SunDo-Taoism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the vision of Master Hyunmoon Kim, SunDo has remained true to its mission in helping people to awaken to higher states of consciousness through personal transformation. The SunDo Mountain Taoist Center is pleased to offer this workshop, Returning Light &amp;amp; Illuminating Shadow, to assist people in developing the light of consciousness through meditation and to illuminate the shadows of our own nature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The workshop also explores breath meditation as a transformative, life-changing tool. Focusing on breath meditation, this workshop discusses how to inhale and exhale more fully, and to let go of everything that impedes the movements of your breath. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In today’s society, with such a wide-ranging breadth of holistic practices, how can one find and maintain a practice with enough depth to generate real transformation? Join us as we discuss the answer to this question for ourselves and our world with Taoist Master Hyunmoon Kim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href="http://www.sundo.org/events" target="_blank"&gt;www.sundo.org/events&lt;/a&gt; for a printable flyer, or call The SunDo-Taoist Center at 860.523.5260.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A $20 donation is requested to support the work of SunDo, a non-profit organization dedicated to teaching Taoist philosophy and practice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The workshop will run from approximately 3 to 5 pm, with and optional dinner afterward with Master Kim and SunDo instructors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;“SunDo practice is an exemplary model of a &lt;br /&gt;psycho-spiritual system that gives us insight &lt;br /&gt;into the possiblity of human development.”&lt;/b&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; -- Charles Silverstein, Program Coordinator &lt;br /&gt;of The Graduate Institute’s Conscious Evolution &lt;br /&gt;Master’s Degree Program and SunDo Practitioner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265141511000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263159834000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Returning Light &amp; Illuminating Shadow</name><id>12279694</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264968000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/12279694/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/5/global_12058597.jpeg</photo_url></item>
