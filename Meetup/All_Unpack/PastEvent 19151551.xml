<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'd like to meet and share healing attunements with other Reiki / energy healing practitioners near Somerville. I know of a place (Third Life Studio) with reasonable rates that we could rent for a couple of hours, have tea, get to know each other a little and then do a share. They have back jack chairs and cushions already and if we needed more we could bring our own. (Has anyone used this space before?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be most successful with a small to medium-sized group, say 6-15 people. Also it would be nice to try not to overlap with some of the other regional Reiki shares, so perhaps not Monday or Wednesday evenings. I'd really enjoy meeting sometime in the next few weeks, maybe we could do another in July &amp;amp; August as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can also support each other in our practices, or whatever stage of energy study each person is in! It's wonderful to both offer and receive insights and suggestions for new techniques, interpretations, and approaches to both learning and offering energy work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to replies :)  &amp;lt;3  many harmonious blessings!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308586582000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Healing Practitioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-healers-network</urlname><id>511093</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Healers Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305937047000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>how about a Reiki/energywork practitioners' share w/attunements in Somerville?</name><id>19151551</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308351600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-healers-network/events/19151551/</event_url></item>
