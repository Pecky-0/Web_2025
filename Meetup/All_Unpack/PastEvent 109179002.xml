The building is right across from the Boston Harbor Hotel, and across from Panera. From South Station or Aquarium subway, it is a short walk down the Greenway. My cell phone number is 617-818-2923. Feel free to call if you're having trouble finding the group. We usually go out to dinner afterwards between 630-7, generally to Chinatown (we decide each time). Â Do not worry about being there right on time - many people come late due to work, but please call if you will be there after 630 so you can meet us for dinner as we may leave International Place then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure you can make it, please consider RSVP'ing Yes and posting a note or emailing me to say you are not sure, rather than not RSVP'ing at all. But there is no need to RSVP No if you have never been to the Wednesday group before.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We usually sit close to au bon pain.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suzanne</member_name><member_id>1732576</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363834518000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363229458000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday conversation group - downtown</name><id>109179002</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363815000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/109179002/</event_url></item>
