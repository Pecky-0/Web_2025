It's a fun and casual way to meet new people. We will reserve a number of tables accordingly per the rsvps. All levels of pool players are welcome. Come and tell us your latest stock tip or what your holiday plans are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had quite a few &lt;b&gt;new members&lt;/b&gt; join recently. It would be &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt; to meet and greet some of the new members. But of course all members new and old are welcome. We will play for about 2 -3 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do serve burgers, pizza &amp;amp; appetizers for those that would like to order some food. After pool, we can grab a quick bite or get some bubble tea @ Tea Infusions. There are many restaurants in the area and Tea Infusions serves some light appetizers also. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to get there&lt;/b&gt; - you can take B train/green line to Packards Corner (Super 88 intersection) or 1 stop later at Harvard Ave and walk a couple of blocks to Big City. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Driving&lt;/b&gt; - parking is tough, but try Harvard Ave and Brighton Ave.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for group of asians.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve </member_name><member_id>5132502</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Warren</member_name><member_id>5756338</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227386241000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>15</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>47</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225149493000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TGIF - Pool</name><id>9043163</id><headcount>41</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226102400000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/9043163/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/4/global_4287444.jpeg</photo_url></item>
