Many more people are engaged in the presidential election than in decades. People say this is the most interesting and engaged election they've experienced in their lifetime.

And now, independents are getting organized! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are looking to do these casual conversations every month. So, if you can't make this one, please let me know if you would be opened to another one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>CBC will just be opening and I'll be outside with a HUGE SMILE :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane</member_name><member_id>4305566</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211298667000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><why>Independent's are having a big impact on the presidential elections.
