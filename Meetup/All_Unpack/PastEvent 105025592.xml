The film combines in-depth interviews with archival footage and computer animation to recount the role that the group played in Israel's security from the Six Day War to the present. The film was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards. The problem was the get the "Gatekeepers," or former heads of the Shin Bet to agree to appear on camera to discuss their work. Given the secretive nature of the organization, none of them had ever done this before, and many of the topics were either classified or highly sensitive. A lively discussion follows on the security of Israel today.&lt;/p&gt;
