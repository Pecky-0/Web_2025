I'll be talking about basic electronics, different cameras, types of DVRs, cables &amp;amp; adapters, audio recorders and EMF/Magnetic Field formation &amp;amp; detection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is what I'm thinking for activities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:00 - 8:15   Arrive/Introductions.&lt;br /&gt;8:15 - 9:30   Basic electrical theory, types of equipment, setup/troubleshooting.&lt;br /&gt;9:30 - 11:30 Team practical exercise/brief mock investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Notes:&lt;br /&gt;Bring a notebook, flashlight, a folding chair for the discussion, and snacks to share.&lt;br /&gt;Dress warmly as the scenic does not have its heat turned on.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the individual in jeans and a gray hoodie.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlie</member_name><member_id>6000445</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227226209000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225661261000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Equipment Training Session and Mock Investigation</name><id>9079497</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226797200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/9079497/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/1/global_2599441.jpeg</photo_url></item>
