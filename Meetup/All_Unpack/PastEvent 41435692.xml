This emanation is visualized as an outline of cascading color and may be held to represent soul vibrations, chakra emergence, or a reflection of surrounding energy fields. Each color represents a different aspect of that matter. Reading auras can be useful in helping you interact with the world. Everything has an aura but we have been "trained" not to see them. This class focuses on stimulating the chakras, which are responsible for the ability to &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; auras. With practice, they will grow in strength, and viewing auras will become progressively easier to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329226255000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321480990000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - Auras</name><id>41435692</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329087600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/41435692/</event_url></item>
