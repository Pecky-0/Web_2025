We are a very casual group. Nothing super formal here. Please join us either here online (in our discussion boards or Albums), at our monthly meetings (with photo related topics - but we always make time for socializing as well) or on our outings- click and shoots, photo lectures, group discussions, trips and workshops... etc. What ever photo thing you are into -we are sure you will find a chance to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a group we do have a gallery space located at City Hall. Every 3-4 months we hang images in this space that are based on a city wide theme. There is a juried entry process- but even that is very casual. You may submit an image online and if chosen you make a print of the image, have it matted and then attend one of our famous framing parties (the city provides the frames) but we do the work framing them. The show is up for a few months and then we trade out those photos for a new batch. For more information on this gallery please contact organized Donna Dufault with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join our Flicker Group: http://www.flickr.com/groups/826456@N20/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: there is a "Worcester Photo Studios" group here on Meetup as well and we are not associated with the group- but there are many cross over members.&lt;/p&gt;
