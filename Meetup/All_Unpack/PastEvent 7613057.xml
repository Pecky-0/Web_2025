It is off of 302, on the North side of the road just before the Highland Center (on opposite side of the road).  Expect windy condtions at the summit, and be prepared with traction devices.  Snowshoes, and microspikes or crampons will be appropriate, and appropriate winter gear.   We will ascend Mt Pierce using the Crawford Path, and if conditions are favorable will traverse from Crawford Path over to Mt Eisenhower.  We will return using Crawford Path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Mileage: to Mt Pierce: rt: 6.4 miles, 2,400 feet elevation gain.  If we decide to make the traverse to Eisenhower along the Crawford Path, the total will be rt: 9.6 miles, 3,250 feet elevation gain.  We will decide among us which way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email me with questions!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a beige Subaru Outback SW.
