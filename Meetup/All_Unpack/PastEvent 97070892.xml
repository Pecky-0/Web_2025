&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visible In Boston&lt;/strong&gt; is a brand new initiative/organization that I've founded along with a colleague of mine. We are small, we are young and our "events" are completely unofficial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of our &lt;em&gt;Friendly Takeovers&lt;/em&gt; is to create more inclusive social spaces within Boston by adding some color (and understanding) to the mostly White after-work crowd. Currently we are specifically targeting Back Bay/Copley Square and Downtown Boston. These are some of the most visible areas of the city and at the same time areas where people of color of all ethnicities often feel invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live here, we work here, we learn here--we should also feel good about playing here. So, come out and have a drink with us. Bring some friends &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; White allies and lets show Boston who actually lives here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael M</member_name><member_id>10972956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359384478000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>businessnetwork-960</urlname><id>1253532</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Professionals of Color Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>47</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356885896000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friendly Takeover w/ Visible In Boston</name><id>97070892</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359154800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/businessnetwork-960/events/97070892/</event_url></item>
