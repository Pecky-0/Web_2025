Tens of thousands of people and organizations are using Drupal to power scores of different websites, ranging from small personal blogs to large corporate and political sites, including whitehouse.gov and data.gov.uk. Drupal is used for ecommerce, podcasting and photo galleries, social networking sites, knowledge management, business collaboration and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/53948" target="_blank"&gt;More info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dr. Mark A.
