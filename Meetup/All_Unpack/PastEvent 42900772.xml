&lt;p&gt;Brief summary copied from Frank's posting -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owners Lisa and Dan of Harrington's Irish Pub have offerred the Red Sox Natives a section of the first floor bar/restaurant to watch the game. They promised to turn up the volume and provide some light treats to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Arrive early at 3:30pm and get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing. Since&amp;nbsp;Harrington's is all Irish the Red Heads get special treatment here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Time is 4:15pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a Holiday twist with some door prizes for lucky Red Sox Natives and guests.&amp;nbsp;You must be there before half time to be eligible. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's in front of Bank of America and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center. And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station (departs 2:45pm)&amp;nbsp;via the&amp;nbsp;Haverhill Train stopping at Wakefield Station (3:08pm) with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion&amp;nbsp;Street, right on&amp;nbsp;to Main Street and 1 block to Water Street. If you are joining us from the City this is the way to go."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food and drinks. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER AND TIP YOUR SERVERS.&lt;/p&gt;
