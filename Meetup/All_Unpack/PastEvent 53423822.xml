&lt;p&gt;They've been so busy at doing such a fantastic job of taking care of business that they haven't been able to have a proper Grand Opening...until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've invited us to help them celebrate this Saturday February 25th from 9 PM until 2 AM. I know it will be a GRAND time based on their AMAZING Valentines's Day party and the trivia fun with Geeks Who Drink on Fat Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a RED CARPET AFFAIR at which&amp;nbsp;Chef David Castro will provide scrumptious appetizers which will be complimentary.&amp;nbsp;If you come hungry and want more here's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://sweetcarolinesboston.com/menu.php" target="_blank"&gt;Sweet Caroline's Menu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also be able to buy great cocktails and select from their numerous beer on draft and in bottles as well their extensive wine list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's your chance to check out the SWEETEST spot in the Fenway which has plenty of room....matter of fact 4,000 square feet of it. Sweet C's has its own living Green Monster.&lt;/p&gt;
