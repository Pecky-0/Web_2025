In this part, we will look at what makes a superior company (moat, return on equity) and what makes it cheap (future cash flows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In second part, we will cover Graham asset-based value investing or buying dollar for half-dollar. Here we will look into how to value company based on its underlying assets: cash, inventories, capital equipment, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will finish with some strategy questions, such as purchase and sale timing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raimondas Lencevicius has been investing for about twelve years with a focus on Buffettology and net-net value investing in last eight. He holds Ph.D. in Computer Science and works as a researcher at Nokia Research Center in Cambridge. He is a member of our group and is interested in more discussion in our group of value investing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Tom Bulkowski, the technician and author, has given us a free copy of his book &amp;quot;Getting Started in Chart Patterns&amp;quot; to raffle off at this meeting.
