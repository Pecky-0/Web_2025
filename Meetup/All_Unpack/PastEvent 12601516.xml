Route 20W from 128&lt;br /&gt;2. Continue past Wayland center&lt;br /&gt;3. Continue past Whole foods, Bullfinch's, etc.&lt;br /&gt;4. Eventually you'll see a small sign on your right saying &amp;quot;Wayside Inn, next right&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;5. It's a mild fork in the road, at it bear right.&lt;br /&gt;6. the Inn is about 1/2 mile on your right. The tavern is indoors to your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENE: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER: This is more of a travel session, so please pack light, ideally nothing more than a 9x12 sketchbook. Dry media is strongly preferred, unless you are accustomed to working with brush in small settings. Also, expect that we will converse while we sketch, unlike most BPAAG meet-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Sometimes there are many people there, though it doesn't last more than 15 or so minutes until they are seated for their table. Thus, best is to pack something you can sketch in sitting, without table, such as a small sketchbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call me. Save the number below (I myself always forget to do that, then I get there, and I'm clueless what the number was :) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269281153000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266161668000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INDOOR SKETCH GET-TOGETHER: Wayside Inn Tavern, Sudbury</name><id>12601516</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269108000000</time><rsvp_limit>3</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/12601516/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/1/b/global_12503659.jpeg</photo_url></item>
