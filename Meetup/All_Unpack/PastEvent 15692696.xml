(really, who wouldn't want that shirt?)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://xenia.unh.edu/wcrc/hangover.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://xenia.unh.edu/...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the start up time to 10:30.  We can meet at the Braintree Town Hall to carpool up to Salisbury together.  The ride per mapquest will be 1 hour 15 minutes - 55.77 miles.  Race starts at 12:45.  This will give us time to park, check in and get settled before the race starts, and not rush right out of Braintree for those running a few minutes late. &lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to join in for the optional polar bear plunge after the race, remember a towel and some warm clothes!  (I'm game for the plunge if I have company!  That mug would something to be proud of!)  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click on the link to the race to either register on line or print out and mail in a registration.    &lt;br /&gt;RACE IS OPEN TO ONLY 1200!  If you plan on joining us, please register asap to confirm you have a spot!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember the post race party, and that this event is part of the Will Run For Beer racing series.  Smuttynose Beer is a sponsor!  :)  Should be a fun post-race event!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12:45 PM on Saturday, January 1, 2011.   &lt;br /&gt;Location: The Carousel Lounge, Salisbury Beach, MA   &lt;br /&gt;Post Race Party with Live Band: The Carousel Lounge, Salisbury Beach, MA   &lt;br /&gt;Commemorative 30th Annual Hangover Classic long sleeve tee-shirts.   &lt;br /&gt;Hangover Classic mugs to 1st 50 male and female finishers of 10K, first 25 male and female finishers of 5K.   &lt;br /&gt;Optional New Years Day Ocean Plunge!!!
