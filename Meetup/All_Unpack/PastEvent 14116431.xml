How about going back to the tried and true East Bay bike path?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me this &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Sunday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at 10:45 AM on a trip from &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Barrington&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the East Bay Bikepath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire path is roughly 26 miles round trip, but since we're starting from the middle, riders can simply do half the ride for a total of around 13 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet ON THE BIKE PATH in front of Shaws, right next to the white wooden signboards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to be wearing my stylish bike helmet, and I suggest (but do not require) that you do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few (non-alcoholic) beverage and ice cream vendors on the way, so feel free to bring a few dollars for refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red car and a red bike, also I have a cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279626340000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279239140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biking the East Bay on Sunday 13 OR 26 miles</name><id>14116431</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279464300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/14116431/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/8/b/global_16233979.jpeg</photo_url></item>
