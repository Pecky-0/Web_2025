Who will take you there? Everywhere you turn, you hear the &amp;quot;soul&amp;quot; mentioned; people looking for their &amp;quot;soul mates&amp;quot; and trying to discover who they are as souls. All the while, the nature and location of the soul remain unknown to so many; but not to all. At this seminar, Father Peter will awaken within you the truth about the soul, which will leave you with a clear understanding that will springboard you into a real search that will lead to real discovery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation $35 • Light Lunch Included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes is an ordained Priest and Master Teacher in the Order of Christ/Sophia.
