We will meet by the sitting place you will see all the other people with cameras standing around.  we can all walk around and take pictures of what ever you want or you can model for everyone as well.  It is up to you.  Here is a link to the park and it is free to get in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/purg.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there, &lt;br /&gt;Jenn&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking lot near the bathrooms and benches</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer Lamontagne</member_name><member_id>7358665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216066383000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214575993000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Purgatory Chasm State Reservation</name><id>8227655</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215892800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/8227655/</event_url></item>
