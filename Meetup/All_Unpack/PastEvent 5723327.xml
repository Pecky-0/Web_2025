Do you remember &amp;quot;The Perfect Storm&amp;quot; ? It all started here! We will begin at Stage Fort Park in the heart of downtown Gloucester (large parking lot and visitors center there), then move on to East Gloucester, Atlantic road - great ocean vistas, crashing surf on the rocks - long sidewalk route eventually ending at Good Harbor beach. Many of us after the walk will go to the Gloucester House Restaurant (looks over the water) for an early dinner (late lunch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Carpooling is recommended/available. Carpoolers can meet at the LL Bean parking lot in Burlington MA off of Rte 95/128 exit 33A. Gloucester is 30 minutes from Burlington MA on the North Shore. Carpoolers should meet at 10:25am in Burlington at the LL Bean parking lot. Call Sharon's cell 508-341-6396 if you want to carpool. If not carpooling please meet at 11am at the &amp;quot;Stage Fort Park&amp;quot; parking lot on Western Ave Gloucester at 11am. (you can google the S.F. Park location)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not have access to email after 6pm Saturday, so call my cell if you have questions. Heavy rain cancels the event, but if only misty it's a &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181660787000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
