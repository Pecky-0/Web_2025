&lt;p&gt;I know I've talked to the "regulars" about this and they thought I should post it to the group so here goes. Margariiittttaaaville's backside needs a bit of a paint job. So I'm having a painting party - I'll supply everything. I'll feed and hydrate you. Once we are done, it'll be game time. Even if you don't want to paint, come on over anyway and play some games for a couple of hours and help refresh drinks or something. Say hi. I'll be holding this event rain or shine. We'll play games longer on Sat afternoon if it rains and anyone that wants to paint, I have a few indoor painting projects that need to be done too.&amp;nbsp;If you are coming to help paint, bring crappy clothes that you don't mind getting paint on. :) If you want to bring something, desserts and snacks are always good. Bring your favorite game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poker tournament starts at 6:00pm for those that don't want to paint,&amp;nbsp;$20.00 buy in, no rebuys, top 2 win. For those that do not want to participate in the POKER game, not to worry, plenty of rooms and tables for other games to go around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a shedding machine named Princess for those of you that may have a dog allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking logistics: Please park in the emergency lane or CVS parking lot.&amp;nbsp;Please do not park in the front or side of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring $1.00 donation for Nina, to help offset the meetup subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing everyone there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret&lt;/p&gt;
