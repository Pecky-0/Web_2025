&lt;p&gt;Joan Crawford Hosts Bingo with over $2500 in cash prizes, some pretty awesome vacation prizes, and some other cool stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet Emily outside at 5pm to enter at 5:15.&amp;nbsp; This early meeting is required since there are No Reservations and you cannot hold a spot for anyone.&amp;nbsp; (It is prohibitted by those whom run it.) Officially doors open at 6 to start playing at 7, but you will need to be there by 5:15 if you want to be certain to meet up with Emily and the rest of the group.&amp;nbsp; (Tardy-ness is at your own risk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I will do my best to hold down seats for people who rsvp but can't make it until later* Emily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admission is $20 which includes the required Booklet of Bingo Games.&amp;nbsp; Proceeds will go to Charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingo Dabbers and Extra Bingo games can be purchased for $1 extra Each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beverages are purchased on location.&amp;nbsp; (You CANNOT bring any outside beverages into the club. Not even water. Previous Prices ranged from $1.00 for a bottle of water to $5.00 for a decent size cup of wine. They also have juice, soda, and beer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snacks can be purchased as well, however you CAN bring your own &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;food&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp; (Just not beverage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring snacks to share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is CASH ONLY. They don't accept cards, and as far as I know there are no atms anywhere on the premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (Emily) can be reached on my cell 203-812-9243. I am horrible with directions, so please use google maps or something like that to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be outside near the entrance until 5:15. I wear glasses, but other than that I look like my picture. If you get there after 5:15, I will be in line, inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was posted above, this event is very popular and gets filled up quickly. Last time I went the line was out the door by 5:30. I think 5 is early enough, but if a lot of people respond to this meetup, I may change the meet time to 4:30 or earlier. We can always tailgate in the parking lot! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, anyone who can get there earlier, who wants to tailgate, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleanty of On-Site Free parking is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for Emily.&amp;nbsp; She can be reached at 203-812-9243.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Emily.
