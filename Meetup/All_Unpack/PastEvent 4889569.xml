If anyone has any culinary skills and feels like volunteering, the organiser would be more than happy to hear from you.... I shall be baking a plate of lamingtons, coz my lamingtons rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1146266735000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1143822175000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ANZAC day service and drinks</name><id>4889569</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1145818800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/4889569/</event_url></item>
