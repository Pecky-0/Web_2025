For those of you who don't know, critical mass is an unofficial celebration of bicycles and other non-motorized transportation. We ride through the streets of New Haven (about an hour or so) and end up at a house party or bar. The pace of the ride is slow and it's a lot of fun, with summer rides attracting around 75-100 people, and winter rides featuring 45-75 warmly-dressed cyclists! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so bring your bike down to the green at 5:45 this Friday and bundle up for November's Critical Mass! Meet at the flagpole by Church Street. The ride leaves at 6p (usually), so it pays to get there a bit early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reflective clothing, blinky lights, and a great attitude are a must! Helmet-head is the latest fashion...celebrate life, wear a helmet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric is your contact this month.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542690000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196310897000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November Critical Mass Bicycle Ride, 5:45p Friday 11-30</name><id>6822813</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196462700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6822813/</event_url></item>
