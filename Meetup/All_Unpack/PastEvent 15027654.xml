Tormented day and night by memories and self-blame, Andrew falls in a downward spiral of depression and anger that alienates everyone around him. It is only through a serendipitous friendship and new love with Mary (Sabrina Lloyd) that Andrew is able to sense the life around him - forgive himself, rediscover his muse, and experience the transformative power of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written and directed by Ann Calamia. Produced by Catherine Miller, Ann Calamia, and Lupe Ontiveros. With Anthony Natale, Sabrina Lloyd, Lupe Ontiveros, Robert Picardo, Ashlyn Sanchez, Troy Kotsur, Deanne Bray, Margot Kidder, Robert Hogan, and Aimee Garcia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional information about the movie please visit UniversalSignsMovie.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Erika Wentworth</member_name><member_id>487803</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289607953000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>ASL Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonasl</urlname><id>1298565</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston ASL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286407670000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Universal Signs Film Screening, A Benefit for National Theatre of the Deaf</name><id>15027654</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289520000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonasl/events/15027654/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/1/global_16399809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
