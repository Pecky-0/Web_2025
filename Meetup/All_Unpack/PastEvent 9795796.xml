The class will be designed to provide a much-needed reprieve for those seeking some quiet time or want to learn some relaxation techniques. The bonus from this will be that with repetition, you will become accustomed to applying these skills in other scenarios, whether that is to begin your own ritual at home, or to spontaneously use your calming techniques in other circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who know Sally know what a special person she is. This is a very relaxing and enlightening time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no charge for this class, but donations are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>7932349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236213967000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235320650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sally's Meditation Class</name><id>9795796</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236038400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/9795796/</event_url></item>
