If you have any topics you'd like to suggest, please let me know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some &amp;quot;mini-topics&amp;quot; to warm us up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If Scott attends, he can tell us about his trip to the &amp;quot;Amazing! Meeting&amp;quot; in Australia. &lt;br /&gt;*&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2039777,00.html" target="_blank"&gt;This article in Time magazine&lt;/a&gt; on climate change and climate-change skeptics contains many facts and links to the &amp;quot;stubborn debate over climate change&amp;quot; wherein the season's massive snowstorms cause climate-change skepticism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect: This monthly meeting typically begins with an introduction all around for the benefit of any first-time attendees, and discussion of any announcements, upcoming events, etc. We then move on to a topic of interest to atheists (usually) chosen beforehand. Sometimes participants bring print-outs of articles, research, or books to share on the topic, and sometimes people just come with a story or opinion to share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We loosely moderate the topical discussion to give everyone a chance to participate. Then the conversation often flows onto other related subjects, sometimes in smaller conversation groups around the table. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any ideas for meeting topics, please let any of the co-organizers know. We can also add announcements or &amp;quot;mini-topics&amp;quot; on the agenda if there's anything you'd like to share with the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the large group, some might be wearing atheistic shirts</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul S</member_name><member_id>4811434</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie </member_name><member_id>7248057</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295196227000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287343645000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Morning Topical Meeting--Open Forum/Global Climate Change</name><id>stgrpypcbvb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295191800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/15801792/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/2/global_10991506.jpeg</photo_url></item>
