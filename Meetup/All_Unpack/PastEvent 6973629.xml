And now back to our original description:

I actually don't know much about this film, but with Diane Keaton, Queen Latifah, and Ted Danson, this should be a good bet for a light comedy. 7:00 is my guess, I will update this event when AMC posts the exact time. I'll be in the theater lobby 30 minutes before showtime, and we'll head into the theater 10 minutes before showtime. If it's downstairs, I'll be right behind the corded rope after ticket stubs have been ripped opposite the popcorn counter. If it's upstairs, I'll try to grab one of the tables in front of the coffee house near the large windows.

Synopsis: Bridget Cardigan (Diane Keaton) is shocked to learn that she is on the verge of losing her home and comfortable upper middle class lifestyle when her husband Don (Ted Danson) is downsized from his job. Armed only with a decades old English degree and years as a dedicated mother and corporate wife, Bridget is forced into the unfamiliar labor market with no job skills. Finally, she accepts the only position she can findjanitor at the Federal Reserve Bank.

The one-time suburban mom soon discovers she has more in common with her new co-workers than she thought. Bridget forges an unexpected bond with Nina (Queen Latifah), a hard-working single mom with two kids to raise, and Jackie (Katie Holmes), an exuberant free spirit with nothing to lose. Caught up in a system that underestimates their talents and keeps their dreams just out of reach, Bridget, Nina and Jackie set out to even the score.

After a lifetime of playing by the rules, the three devise a plan to smuggle soon-to-be destroyed currency out of the supposedly airtight Reserve. As the unlikely crime syndicate amasses piles of cash, it looks like they have pulled off the perfect crimeuntil a minor misstep alerts the authorities. With more money than they know what to do with, the women are pushed to the limits of their ingenuity to stay one step ahead of the law!
