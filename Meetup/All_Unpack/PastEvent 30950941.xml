&lt;p&gt;This event takes place at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 17, at Phillips Auditorium, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge. Doors open at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;strong&gt;get there early . . . even before 6:45 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served for the main lecture room. The overflow crowd sits in a separate screening room. Admission is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If weather permits, rooftop stargazing through telescopes will follow the presentation. Dress for stargazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the "staff only" signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Harvard stop on the MBTA Red Line, take any bus or trackless trolley going west on Concord Avenue in Cambridge (Arlmont Village and Belmont Center&amp;nbsp;buses; Huron Avenue trolley) and get off at the Observatory Hill stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more information and directions,&lt;/strong&gt; go to&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events&lt;/a&gt; or call 617.495.7461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line forms early for this event. Please do not cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. (If you are in the separate screening room, turn right after you exit and walk toward the courtyard, then look for signs pointing the way to the telescopes.) You can also look for me and my meetup sign while we are waiting in line to look through the telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the left rear of the lecture hall is a way to let people find me and an empty seat that much more easily. The lectures are lots of fun, though, and I can certainly understand if you would like to sit up front and closer to the (very entertaining!) talks. Please sit where you are most comfortable. If you are bringing children to the event, you may want to sit toward the front so they can see and ask questions. We will be able to chat after the lecture, while we wait in line for a chance to stargaze through the several rooftop telescopes. Each telescope is usually trained on a different sight in the nighttime sky, so waiting in several lines gives us plenty of time to introduce ourselves. And plenty of nighttime objects to observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observatory Night&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, November 17, 2011, &lt;span style="color : #19294b"&gt;"What Is a Planet?"&amp;nbsp;David Aguilar, CfA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;To many people, it seems&amp;nbsp;science is always changing its mind. One day caffeine is good for you, and the next day,&amp;nbsp;it isn't. One day Pluto is a planet, and the next, it isn't. It used to be so simple to answer this basic third-grade question: What is a planet? It's a round body, illuminated by the light of the star it orbits. Now there is confusion when answering this question, even among astronomers. This&amp;nbsp;is due to new technologies, new discoveries, and a touch of scientific hubris. How did this happen? Why all the confusion? Why did Pluto get demoted? And more interesting: Why doesn't the&amp;nbsp;current "official" definition of a planet stand up to recent discoveries or apply to the rest of the universe? Tonight will be an interesting discussion indeed!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;******************************&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Meetup sign.
