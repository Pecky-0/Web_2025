Join us to see the great local band of John Cafferty and Beaver Brown from 6:30 to 8:30pm. Then we can watch the balloons as they slowly rise and glow against the evening sky. Bring your cameras for this popular event. Try to arrive early . &lt;br /&gt;

Look for my rainbow umbrella – I hope to have a spot in front of the music under the tent. &lt;br /&gt;
