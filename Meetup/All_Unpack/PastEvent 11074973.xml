Trophies &amp;amp; prizes will be awarded for the most&lt;br /&gt;originally decorated boats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the conclusion of the tour the boats will raft up at the Lake House docks or at the Happiest Paddler docks and the party will begin at the Lake House. Music will be provided by Basically Blues and the&lt;br /&gt;Johnny 5 Band. Resident Lake House MC “Red Mac” (East Hampton’s own Red McKinney) will MC the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Throughout the day there will be prizes,give a ways, and raffles, along with food and drink specials.The festivities will culminate with the raffle drawing for $10,000.00 Cash First Prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don’t need a boat to enjoy the fun.
