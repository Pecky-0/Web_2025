<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>OK, we had a very spirited discussion last time with admirable skepticism expressed about the implications of naturalism for interpersonal attitudes (thanks Roy!) and its role in keeping society open and pluralistic.  As naturalists who base their understanding of reality on intersubjective evidence, we of course welcome skepticism and open debate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another possible implication of naturalism is that it supports political progressivism, that there's a direct or indirect link between holding a naturalistic worldview and being liberal. Some think there isn't any connection, that one can be a naturalist and also be very conservative in one's political stance, as Jim Farmelant has pointed out was the case for philosopher WVO Quine and is still the case for James Q. Wilson. So, what *are* the implications of naturalism for one's politics, if any? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always people are welcome to raise their own concerns, personal or political, on the spur of the moment.  And we don't always have to be serious. Casual conversation is permitted! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181775834000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179187461000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Naturalism and progressive politics</name><id>5777983</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181602800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/5777983/</event_url></item>
