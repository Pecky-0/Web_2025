We'll meet at E, Brimfield Lake at 8:00 and have our butts in the boats around 8:30.  As for the agenda, we will decide then if we want to wander the lake or head up the river.  Maybe even a bit of both.  Early is the best time for wildlife here so we'll hope for the best.Meet at 8:00 at Long Pond boat ramp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Mass Pike to Rt. 20 West - Stay on Rt. 20 through the center of Sturbridge. About 1/2 mile after the intersection of Rt. 20 and 148 (stay on Rt. 20), there will be a brown sign saying &amp;quot;East Brimfield Dam&amp;quot;, and then shortly after that is another brown sign with a picture of a boat ramp, the entrance to the ramp area is on the right shortly after the ramp sign. When you get down to the parking lot, the sign says &amp;quot;Long Pond / East Brimfield Lake&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Rt. 20 East - Go over the lake, and the entrance to the boat ramp is the first left after you go over the lake.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken C</member_name><member_id>7777174</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220443487000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220060758000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last Minute Early Riser Paddle at East Brimfield Lake Monday Sept 1 st.</name><id>8650398</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220270400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/8650398/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
