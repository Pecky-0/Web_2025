Using the wisdom teaching of the ages Father Peter will teach about how to practically heal emotional wounds and grow in spiritual consciousness.   When we are more connected into the great love and light of God, we have the courage and energy to approach painful parts of ourselves; in turn we become more emotionally healthy and have more space for God. When the spiritual healing and emotional healing processes are joined, they create a powerful momentum for transformation of our bodies, minds, hearts and lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You will realize how true spiritual healing will move you out of old patterns, bringing freshness into your life ~ allowing you to receive everything you've been searching for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, November 11, 7:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allowing Yourself to be Healed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you tired of the things that ail you in body, mind, and spirit? Are you ready to let yourself be healed by seeing the truth about your troubles and to begin to understand their source and what would heal them? Come and learn how to relax into the healing nature of God's truth and love for you, which heals all ailments and repairs all broken hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$25 Bring a friend for free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
