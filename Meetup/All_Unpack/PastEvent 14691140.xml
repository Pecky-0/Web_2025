We'll look at one example of a problem that lends itself to Bloom filters and how to integrate it into a Django app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open Source Marketing Platform&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jonathanstiebel.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jonathan Stiebel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this session, I will show you how I used Pinax (a &amp;quot;ready-to-use&amp;quot; platform) on top of the Django platform to create an open source marketing platform in Python. This provides a landing page for collecting email addresses, a responder that encourages people to confirm their email address, and lets them know they are subscribed. Recently I expanded it to allow for many targeted squeeze pages, and email follow-ups, for a single website. Existing commercial solutions change on a per list basis.&lt;br /&gt;The source code of two applications will be presented implemented using this platform. Please be prepared to offer suggestions for how to extend this project. I am seeking collaborators on this open source project.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shimon Rura</member_name><member_id>409933</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brett Stilwell</member_name><member_id>2081142</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291938645000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Djangonauts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>djangoboston</urlname><id>1289145</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Django Boston Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>38</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283906091000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Django Boston Oct 2010</name><id>14691140</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288303200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/14691140/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/2/global_12798354.jpeg</photo_url></item>
