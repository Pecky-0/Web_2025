In Paris, Nina and her young son are homeless. Their constant drifting leads them to Versailles, where they spend the night with Damien, who lives in a hut in the woods near the famous palace. Early the next morning, Nina leaves the child and vanishes. As the days and seasons pass, Damien and the child form a close bond, but they know they cannot live in the hut forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we'll head to a nearby restaurant for dinner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be up front by the screen at the end of the film.
