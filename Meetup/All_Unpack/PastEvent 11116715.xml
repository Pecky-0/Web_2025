Hike leaders Susan Barlow and George Arthur of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association will lead this moderately paced 2.8-mile walk in Vernon on Saturday, August 29, starting at 1 p.m. Children and families are especially welcome. Wear sturdy shoes or sneakers and expect wet spots, with bumpy terrain. Many mosquitoes, so consider wearing bug repellent. Meet at the driveway of Vernon’s water treatment plant on Route 74. Directions: From Hartford, take I-84 eastbound to exit 64-65. Merge onto Route 83 toward Rockville. Go 3.6 miles and, at the light where Clyde Motors is on the right, take a very sharp left turn onto Windsorville Road/Route 74. Go 0.4 miles, passing the Shaw’s and the Vernon water treatment plant, and take a left into the driveway. Park along the right side of the driveway, heading vertically onto the grass. No dogs, please. Questions may be directed to Susan Barlow, 860-643-9776. Extreme weather cancels.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue backpack</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251739238000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250331410000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hockanum River walk</name><id>11116715</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251565200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/11116715/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/7/global_10195975.jpeg</photo_url></item>
