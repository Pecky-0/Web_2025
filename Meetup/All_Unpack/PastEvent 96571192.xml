These barriers may make it difficult for someone to find employment, housing, apply for benefits, or obtain a license or permit. Connecticutâ€™s pardons system provides the opportunity for individuals with criminal convictions to show that they have been rehabilitated, to fully discharge their debt to society, and to obtain some relief from legal barriers to productive citizenship. Our guest speakers at our next Hartford-area dinner will be Jane Kinney-Knotek and Claudia Mangan of Statewide Legal Services of CT, who will discuss the pardon process in Connecticut and the Pardons Project's efforts to assist low-income clients obtain a fresh start. The dinner will be on Tuesday, Jan. 29 at the Wood-n-Tap restaurant, 112 Town Line Rd in Rocky Hill (near Exit 24). Drinks and socializing at 6:30, Dinner and speaker at 7:00 pm.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the private room - the host or hostess can show you the way.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Blinn</member_name><member_id>588041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359582716000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356549168000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hartford Area Dinner Meeting - The Pardons Project</name><id>96571192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359502200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/96571192/</event_url></item>
