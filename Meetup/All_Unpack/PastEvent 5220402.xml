Please note the date change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;We usually meet at 6:30p, in the BPL, at the tables to the left of the information booth in the middle of the lobby. We may not have a sign so please look for people seated at the tables near the entrance. If you get there first, smile so we can find you!&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet this month from 6:30p to 8p to practice speaking English. Maybe we'll go to supper afterwards at a nearby restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your grammar questions, or any books you think are helpful. We'll start with introductions or an icebreaker...activity to be decided later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can join us, see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group will meet on the first floor of the Library, in the large reading room to the left of the Information Desk. We usually sit at one of the tables near the entrance, on the left. &lt;br /&gt;If you don't find the group, you can ask the Information Desk for the 6:30p Meetup Group for English Conversation. It is NOT a regular BPL English group!&lt;br /&gt;Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.bpl.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bpl.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bpl.org...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1164325042000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1161732820000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston English as a Second Language November Meetup</name><id>5220402</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1164151800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/5220402/</event_url></item>
