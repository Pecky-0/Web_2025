Blankets, food, frisbees, kids, dogs, musical instruments, games...  all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PACKING LIST:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__Blankets&lt;br /&gt;__Camping chairs&lt;br /&gt;__Snacks&lt;br /&gt;__Water&lt;br /&gt;__Games (frisbees, balls, travel board games, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;__Dogs&lt;br /&gt;__Info about events or groups you want to share with SoJusters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns on a blanket? Are you looking for like-minded progressives to hang out with in Boston? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions while snacking and playing frisbee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help us take over a grassy patch at the corner of Beacon and Charles Streets for outdoor family-friendly togetherness.  We're testing out the radical concept of assembling in public, on blankets, with frisbees, for justice.  No loud speakers necessary. We'll be the friendly folks with name tags - join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to connect outside of SoJust events?&lt;/b&gt; Members can view and post events, job &amp;amp; volunteer announcements, roommate searches, etc. on the website - just click '&lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/"&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt;'.  The &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/calendar"&gt;SoJust Calendar&lt;/a&gt; is packed with social justice-related events held throughout Greater Boston.  Help us keep it filled - tell us about events you hear about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From our FAQs:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;It's not very easy for me to meet new people and I'm not really one for small talk at bars.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hear you. That's why at SoJust events, in addition to traditional name tags, we have &amp;quot;Ask Me About&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Looking For&amp;quot; tags. That way you can slap whatever you're into lately up on your shirt and wait for fellow SoJusters to approach you. These seem to do the trick of moving past the basic &amp;quot;what do you do for work? where do you live?&amp;quot; questions to conversations that lead to more substantial connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;What actually happens at events?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll always be greeted by friendly folks who can help get you socializing, introduce you to people, and chat with you about questions or wishes. It's likely a few people will be there promoting their campaigns and issues (&lt;i&gt;yes, SoJust welcomes that sort of behavior&lt;/i&gt;). At our bigger events, there's always a literature table to toss down flyers, postcards, and other paraphenalia about events around town. Most importantly, we can pretty much guarantee there will be someone there you've never met before. As one of our members said, &amp;quot;You are bringing together people who might never get together otherwise - if that ain't a step towards justice I don't know what is.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?&lt;/b&gt; Check out our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3187615"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/photos/"&gt;Event Photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243094705000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239853797000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Socializing for Justice on Boston Common</name><id>10196392</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241893800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/10196392/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/c/global_8174524.jpeg</photo_url></item>
