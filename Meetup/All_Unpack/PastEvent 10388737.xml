<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is my friend from grad school's band, but truth is, even if I weren't friends with the band I'd probably see them anyway - they put on a great show!  Good live acoustic set - they have a number of originals but also do some great covers (james, kings of leon, foo fighters - the crowd pleasers)!  Anyhow, I'll be going to this show one way or the other, but would love to have some company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note - I may be running a few minutes late to this - I'm going to be coming directly from BU's commencement, and since I'm working as a Marshal how late I need to stay is up in the air.  I should nearly definitely be able to make it by 9:45 though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/prettyimpressivemusic" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt; to check out the band - they're really great, and I'd love to have some fellow dancers/music appreciators come out to join me!  Especially if you've had a nice long afternoon in the park, this will be a nice way to cap off the evening!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP for details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242736325000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242078900000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Pretty Impressive" at Porter Belly's Pub in Brighton</name><id>10388737</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242524700000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10388737/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/5/9/global_8590953.jpeg</photo_url></item>
