You just pay the price of MFA admission (and for the wine etc..) There's music too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will gather around 6 pm at the entrance (inside the museum but not past the entrance barrier). If you are going to arrive later that's OK but it might be hard to find us once we've gone upstairs - it gets busy in there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can mix and mingle, we won't necessarily clump together as a group for the whole evening, but it's nice to go in with some friends and then maybe tour in 2s and 3s after a glass of wine..or hang out and meet new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay as long as you like, it goes on until 9.30 pm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Buy your ticket and we will meet at 6 pm in the foyer (Huntington Ave entrance) - I'll be wearing a leather jacket and a bright blue scarf...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1328446327000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327636691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Friday at the MFA!</name><id>49819272</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328310000000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/49819272/</event_url></item>
