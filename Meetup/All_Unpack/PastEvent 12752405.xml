It is closely tied to the Portuguese word &amp;quot;saudade,&amp;quot; which has no equivalent translation in the English vocabulary and refers to a deep sense of longing for something lost long ago.   While its first records of its performance dates back to the 1820's, its roots are believed to be much older and closely tied to the oral history of the Portuguese people.  The genre is characterized by a true fusion of international musical styles, including Moroccan Muslim music, Spanish Flamenco, music of the Iberian Sephardic Jews, and of course the music and Portuguese Peasants.  Some scholars believe this genre was one of the many lasting contributions to western civilization born out of the era of &amp;quot;Convivencia;&amp;quot; a period of 600 years in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived in relative peace throughout the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Fado and it's &amp;quot;Fadistas,&amp;quot; performers of this musical genre, are cited as a major musical influence in the development of well known musical styling's; including that of present day recording artists Nellie Furtado, a Grammy winning pop star, and even the likes of  Wynton Learson Marsalis, Jazz Trumpeter and Artistic Director for Jazz at New York City's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, who in 2009 shared the Lincoln Center stage with international renowned Fadista, Mariza . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268759520000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267500576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An afternon with Portuguese food and Fado music</name><id>12752405</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268586000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/12752405/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/e/c/global_11884844.jpeg</photo_url></item>
