Processing is &amp;quot;an open source programming language and environment for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions.&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://processing.org...&lt;/a&gt;)  It's implemented in Java, and offers a simplified Java-like syntax for students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists. Jonathan's Processing.py brings makes it possible to write Processing sketches in Python.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan's presentation will start by introducing Processing, demoing what it can do, and how it has helped artists and designers experiment with algorithmic art and visualizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he'll get into the deep details of how he used Jython to meld a Python interpreter into the Processing implementation to allow Python programs access to the Processing execution environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be a very interesting evening, looking at both the user-visible environment, and the nitty-gritty under the hood of how it was accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talk starts at 7:00, social niceties both before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: We'll be meeting at the Google offices this month, at 5 Cambridge Center.  Google will be providing pizza, but unfortunately, there is NO subsidized parking.  Parking in the adjacent garage is $17 for 3 hours.  If you know of other appropriate alternatives, send them to the list.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ned Batchelder</member_name><member_id>1824278</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287720228000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>75</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285782883000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Processing.py, inside and out</name><id>14939685</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287615600000</time><rsvp_limit>100</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/14939685/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/8/4/global_13742692.jpeg</photo_url></item>
