The band manages to tastefully challenge the traditional approach to Latin Jazz with an infusion of R&amp;amp;B and Caribbean nuances. The melodies and montunos are hip and illustrate how Latin Music is beginning to evolve...and evolution is what Fantagious is all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Original scores are balanced with jazz standards such as Herbie Hancock's Maiden Voyage and Paul Desmond's Take Five, brilliantly arranged into the Ritmo Masacote-style of sounds and dance forms.&amp;quot; -- Latin Beat Magazine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On board with the band are Grammy-winning NYC percussionist Pablo &amp;quot;Chino&amp;quot; Nu√±ez, NYC bassist Panagiotis Andreou, and a slew of Boston's finest led by musical director Joel &amp;quot;Masacote&amp;quot; Massicot. &amp;quot;It is bassist/vocalist Panagiotis Andreou who is the real wild card here, and bless Masacote for allowing Andreou to bring a new sensibility to the proceedings...Andreou really shines on a trio of Middle-Eastern and Greek tinged tracks.&amp;quot; -- Pablo Yglesias, Descarga.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is no surprise that with this outstanding cast of musicians, Fantagious is full of flavor and swing. Joel Masacote shows his maturity in all aspects of this production, going above and beyond any set expectations. Joel's keen awareness about the relationship between the music &amp;amp; dance as well as their application through his compositions &amp;amp; arrangements have earned him instant recognition as a pioneer in the evolution of Latin Music.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the lady walking around with cds :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana Masacote (manager)</member_name><member_id>2622923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227406139000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222373485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Fantagious" Latin Jazz Dinner Concert @ Skullers Jazz Club!</name><id>8833076</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227060000000</time><rsvp_limit>150</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/8833076/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/2/6/global_5644646.jpeg</photo_url></item>
