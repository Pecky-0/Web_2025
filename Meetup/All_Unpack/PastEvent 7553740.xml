<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 100 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 9:00 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 9:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;From Hartford and/or points east of Danbury:&lt;br /&gt;* Take Rt. 84 West to exit 9-Rt. 25 North towards Brookfield.&lt;br /&gt;* In Brookfield, take a right onto Rt. 7 North approximately 25 miles to the Bull?s Bridge Inn.&lt;br /&gt;* You are there when... approaching a stoplight, you see a gas station / food mart followed by the Bull?s Bridge Inn (large white house) on the right.&lt;br /&gt;* Cross the covered bridge and park in parking areas and along the right side of road past the second bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there from Boston and New England:&lt;br /&gt;* I-90 West (Mass Turnpike) to Exit 2 ?
