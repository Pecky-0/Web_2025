I know you all have been wondering, &amp;quot;When will there EVER be another Cashflow meetup?&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well here is your answer:  THIS SUNDAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to restart our regular Cashflow meetups at the Marino Center at Northeastern University.  We start at 3pm and go to 6pm.  We also like to start ON TIME because being late sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marino has a convenience store, an Au Bon Pain, and a Bolocco right there in case you get hungry.  It's also well air-conditioned in case it's hot out.  Some have even brought a sweater on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING YOUR CALCULATORS AND PENCILS!  You will need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, we will have a beginner table, and we'll even run a 202 board if we have enough QUALIFIED people.  FYI:  for this meetup you need to have gotten out of the Rat Race at least FIVE TIMES in order to play the 202 game.  It just ensures you know what you're doing so you don't slow down the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, we'll see you there!!  Bring your friends who want to make something better of their life through changing their perspective on money while having FUN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, you can park on the street there...but if you get a ticket, I didn't tell you that.  I've NEVER gotten a ticket for parking in the resident parking areas.  What can I say?  Life is about risks, isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276558901000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276127643000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>REGULAR Cashflow Meetup </name><id>13754399</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276455600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/13754399/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
