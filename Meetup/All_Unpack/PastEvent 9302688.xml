Since the Franklin Café does not do brunch, on January 11th we could meet at 5:00pm at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franklin Café (The South End)&lt;br /&gt;278 Shawmut Ave.&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02118&lt;br /&gt;617 350 0010&lt;br /&gt;Price: Reasonable&lt;br /&gt;www.franklincafe.com (check them out on the web)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Franklin Café comes with rave... reviews! I've been wanting to try this venue for a while now.  Let me know what you think. And, if people really have their heart set on brunch, we can pick another spot. With all of that said though, here's a little history on the Franklin Café... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1995 David Dubois was approached by Maureen McLaughlin, one of Boston’s most well known bartenders, with the idea of opening a South End neighborhood restaurant/bar that would reflect Boston’s growing cosmopolitan sense of self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sixteen months of development and build-out David and Maureen opened the Franklin Café in December of 1996. The restaurants unique ability to combine some of the cities best Modern American cuisine, a great wine list, nine microbrews on tap, with a lively eclectic bar scene made it an instant favorite. This coupled with a full menu served seven days a week until 1:30 a.m. Made late night at the Franklin Café the place to unwind for the staff from many of Boston’s best restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these years later the Franklin Café has become synonymous with consistent quality, value, and a great time as well as bringing these two area-natives local, national, and international accolade and attention. Most importantly to David and Maureen these two restaurants have become a healthy and productive part of the fabric of their respective communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, hope to see you all at the Franklin Café in early 2009. If not, whatever you're up to, I hope you are doing well and taking care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Mike/Meet up</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233521626000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228764547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch Anyone?
