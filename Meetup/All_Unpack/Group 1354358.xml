Get together and meet new people where everyone who attends contributes something to a meal - good time to try adventurous new recipes without having to worry if they don't turn out good!!    Whoever hosts makes the rules (Italian, Indian, chilli cookoff, all recipes have alcohol as an ingredient, Julie Child recipes, etc)  Please bring a dish that suits the theme with a bottle of wine, beer or bottled water.</description><rating>4.29</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1231598094000</created><lat>42.3100013733</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>228</id><urlkey>cooking</urlkey><name>Cooking And Recipes</name></topics_item></topics><name>Near Boston 30 something cooking club</name><id>1354358</id><members>321</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>9845850</member_id><name>Anya Thomas</name></organizer><urlname>NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/6/c/600_6879276.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/6/c/highres_6879276.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>6879276</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/6/c/thumb_6879276.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club/</link><lon>-71.0599975586</lon></item>
