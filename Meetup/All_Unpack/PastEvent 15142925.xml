It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing -- though absurdly comic -- meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of modern fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt, many of you have read, and perhaps reread this. I invite you to read it again, in a good translation, and on what seems like the ideal time of year to fully appreciate its tone and atmosphere, Halloween night. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>11</waitlist_count><updated>1289862008000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287372278000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kafka: The Metamorphosis</name><id>15142925</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288562400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/15142925/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
