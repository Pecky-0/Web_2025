<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>* It's the third Tuesday of the month, and it's right after the Primary! Join us for the first meetup of the fall season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Want to vent about Obama and his fellow Dems, or speculate about the upcoming election with someone who may actually share your viewpoint?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Don't really care much about politics, but just looking to hang out with local conservatives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monthly meetup is a casual gathering to give us lonely MA Republicans an opportunity to meet one another. The recent crowds have included a great mix of long-time members and first-time attendees, men and women of all ages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come whenever you can for a drink or dinner, or simply for the conversation. As always, there's NO AGENDA, so feel free to talk politics, current events, jobs, sports, vacation plans, movies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * &lt;b&gt;PARKING TIPS&lt;/b&gt; * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your most economical option will be to luck out with street parking (meters run till 8PM).
