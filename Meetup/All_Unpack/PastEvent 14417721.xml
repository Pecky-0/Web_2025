Just a gravel parking area on your right just after the left turn toward the airport. JC Phillips abuts the Project Adventure lands - so the woods go on for quite a way beyond the park boundary. &lt;br /&gt; One drawback is that is shares a driveway with a private residence - so you usually have to park in the gravel crescent right off 97 and walk the 1/4 mile to the entrance. There is a place to squeeze one or two cars up by the trail entrance though - it's worth a try.&lt;br /&gt; If we can meet for a carpool that would be great! I can fit at least three or four in my truck. I know this is short notice, but I have been traveling for work.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the "Mushroom Lovers USA" sign on my truck!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Sargent</member_name><member_id>10146598</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281885194000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fungi's &amp; gils</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mushroom-Lovers-USA</urlname><id>1497456</id><group_lat>42.4700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>Mushroom Lovers USA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281748316000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>J C Phillips Nature Preserve, Beverly, Ma</name><id>14417721</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281880800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mushroom-Lovers-USA/events/14417721/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/a/global_14374906.jpeg</photo_url></item>
