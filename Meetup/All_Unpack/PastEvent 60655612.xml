<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;June 16th is almost the Summer Solstice.&lt;/span&gt; The summer solstice occurs exactly when the axial tilt of a planet's semi-axis in a given hemisphere is most inclined towards the star that it orbits. Earth's maximum axial tilt to our star, the Sun, during a solstice is 23° 26'. Let's enjoy the night with a wine tasting and bring in the Summer!  (Like we need a reason...&lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/1723755200050492932723/img/smileys/biggrin.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For wine night, everyone will bring a bottle of wine (no boxed wine or 1.75MLs please) AND a pot luck dish, finger food, hors d'oeuvres or desert. Please indicate what food item you want to bring when you sign up. If you are coming by yourself or don't want to go in with someone just bring a bottle of wine that is $15 or more ( 750 ml) with your dish. Couples or groups can go in together on a bottle that is $30 or more depending on the quantity of people in the group, to ensure we have a good assortment of wines to taste. Get some different types of wine so we have a varied taste testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reds - Malbec, Blends, cab, merlot,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;shiraz&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;pinot noir.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whites - sav blanc, chards, reisling, pinot grigio, etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please ensure you show up if you RSVP yes, since we may have a waiting list and you are taking up a persons spot if you do not show up. If you must cancel, the earlier the better if there is a waiting list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;*Please note* The address will be sent a few days prior to the event if you don't have it already to all the "yes" RSVPs, due to this being a private residence. It should go without saying to Drink Responsibly. I will have water and coffee too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is for 3 meetup groups for a great party. Only sign up on one site if you belong to more than one for an accurate count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enjoy the night in fun, style and class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;**As always this is a multi group meetup and a BYOWG...bring your own wine glass and take it home!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This event if from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;6pm - 10pm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Knock on the door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ralph</member_name><member_id>8774347</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340018768000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
