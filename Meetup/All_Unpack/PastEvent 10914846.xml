My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules for Engagement for Events with &lt;u&gt;Reservations&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at (617) 445-7549.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVPs are on a first come, first served basis.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment requesting to be placed on wait list.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If dinner is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will automatically be changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the dinner and you have not attended, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I change you're RSVP to NO because you haven't replied to final update dinner confirmation email deadline, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW each will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within twenty-four hours of the dinner, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email Tonya about rejoining.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will arrive at 6:45 PM to confirm seating and welcome you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya/Meetup reservation or call/text my cell (617) 445 7549</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250284433000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248097841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oliveira's Restaurant - Dinner - Saturday July 25th 7 PM</name><id>10914846</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248562800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/10914846/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/5/global_8852325.jpeg</photo_url></item>
