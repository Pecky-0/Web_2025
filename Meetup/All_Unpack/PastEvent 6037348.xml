Cochituate is a series of three joined lakes. All three are open to power boats, but the top lake is restricted to 5 mph. This event is suitable for beginning paddlers is kid friendly. Cochituate has on site boat rental, the rates are listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The park has a $5 entry fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as this is a large territory with lots of people, it will be a challenge to have a meeting spot. The plan is to stake out a spot near the boat rental. Leo will prop up a purple whitewater kayak as a sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please put what you want to bring in your rsvp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nasty weather will cancel this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email me with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The official park website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/coch.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map of the lake &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paddleboston.com/natick/map.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.paddlebost...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from the Massachusetts Turnpike: Take Exit 13 (Natick/Framingham).
