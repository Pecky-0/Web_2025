It's a solipsistic funhouse world that makes &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; people seem bland and pitiful. Arturo the Aqua-Boy, who has flippers and an enormous need to be loved. A museum of sacred monsters that didn't make it. An endearing &amp;quot;little beetle&amp;quot; of a heroine. Sort of like Tod Browning's Freaks crossed with David Lynch and John Irving and perhaps George Eliot -- the latter for the power of the emotions evoked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet downstairs at Life Alive again on January 12th, 2010 at 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toni&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Toni</member_name><member_id>6932615</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295486628000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292455508000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Readers 2 - January Meetup</name><id>15744956</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295481600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/15744956/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/c/e/global_1450046.jpeg</photo_url></item>
