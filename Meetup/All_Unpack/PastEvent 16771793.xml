<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;If a man, let&amp;rsquo;s call him Chester, has been receiving praises for a well publicized unselfish act and, you perhaps, happen to know that his actions were anything but selfless you might say, &amp;ldquo;Yes, but I know what Chester&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; motivation was and believe me when I tell you that it was not good!&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Here are some other considerations concerning the question, "What is real?":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more real than cause-and-effect? Is it not often said that if you want to know the true nature of a thing you should look at its cause?&amp;nbsp; Well, if&amp;nbsp;someone has a dream that is the direct cause of a subsequent action, then is the dream real because it is the cause of something that is by all accounts&amp;nbsp;quite real?&amp;nbsp; And if you say that the dream was not real but the action was, then how can something that is not real&amp;nbsp; be the cause something that is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more real than pain!&amp;nbsp; But as we all know, pain is just in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plato, as we recall, in his story about the shadow world of the men in the cave, believed that our perceptions of reality are shadow-like imitations of the pure world of the Forms. Kant wrote about the unknowable and undescribable reality behind the phenomenal world of sense that he called &amp;lsquo;noumena&amp;rsquo;; phenomena&amp;nbsp; itself is merely a product of the transcendental structure of the human mind. Hegel, on the other hand, believed that reality is in our concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the reality of the self?&amp;nbsp; Now that&amp;rsquo;s a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History is sometimes false.&amp;nbsp; And are not nations and humanity a product of history?&amp;nbsp; The history books we study in school truly shape our reality.&amp;nbsp; But if history is false, is reality a sham?&amp;nbsp; And what does one say about a reality that is built upon lies? In that case, one might argue that the perceived reality and the beliefs that are founded upon it are illusions, i.e, unreality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittgenstein wrote that &amp;ldquo;the meaning of a word is its use.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; He talked about &amp;ldquo;language-games&amp;rdquo; and how the use of a word&amp;mdash;i.e. its meaning&amp;mdash;depends on the rules of use embedded in the particulars of the situation. In other words, talking about the &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo; or unreality of pain will have different rules of use than talking about the &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo; of observable events.&amp;nbsp; Discussing the&amp;nbsp; &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo; of&amp;nbsp; history, dreams, right and wrong, the self, etc. involve different language-games.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I propose that the language-game of this discussion be about the meaning that is shared by all the other meaningful uses of the word &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo;. What is real about reality?&amp;nbsp; Or put another way, what is the common meaning of 'real'&amp;nbsp; that is shared by each usage of the word?&amp;nbsp; What does the reality of pain have to do with the reality of dreams, of history, or ideas?&amp;nbsp; Is there any commonality here at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion should be real good.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
