You can &lt;br /&gt;be sure the producers take notice of the increased viewerships their shows &lt;br /&gt;receive when they interview Congressman Paul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tune in to CNBC's Squawk Box this Tuesday from 8-9am eastern and support &lt;br /&gt;Ron Paul's message of economic freedom!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Guy Holland</member_name><member_id>7415642</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261055754000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260802487000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul co-hosts CNBC Squawk Box</name><id>12081292</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260882000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/12081292/</event_url></item>
