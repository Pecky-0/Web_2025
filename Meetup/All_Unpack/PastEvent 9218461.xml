We'll squeeze in one more brisk hike down my favorite walking trail before the weather get's too crazy &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;There will be a total of 3 groups doing this event so it should be a BLAST!&lt;br /&gt;We'll start the walk at 9:30 and finnish about 11:30 or 12.&lt;br /&gt;After the hike I hope you can join all of us for lunch at a great place a few miles from the trail, Finders Pub located at 171 West Boylston St. (Rt. 12) in West Boylston.&lt;br /&gt;Their menu is HUGE, The food is great, and the prices are LOW plus they have FREE pop corn and salted peanuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always there is NO &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; RSVP choice (for my events anyways). Since there isn't an RSVP limit OR deadline if unsure RSVP the day before the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make the hike join us at Finder's at about 12-12:30.&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you're joining us late or for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;(508)212-4111&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the black Toyota pick up with a small meet up sign in parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>3673693</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230626273000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227476095000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike on The Mass Central Rail Trail</name><id>9218461</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229265000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/9218461/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/f/6/global_6017366.jpeg</photo_url></item>
