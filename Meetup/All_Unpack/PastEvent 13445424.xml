Come early to donate; stay to buy and/or help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need lots of stuff -- ask family members or neighbors if they have goods to contribute, and don’t forget to bring your own. We also need people to set up, price items, take money, provide snacks, clean up at the end, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, the better advertised this yard sale is, the better the attendance, and the more we’ll raise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're scheduled to present the scholarship in early June, but we need to raise enough money to fund it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marie A</member_name><member_id>4623326</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273976000000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273545663000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BBTC Scholarship Fundraiser (Yard Sale)</name><id>13445424</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273928400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/13445424/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/b/global_3153499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
