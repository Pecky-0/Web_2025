Should be able to play 5-1 and 6-2 formations, have a good grasp of skills (passing, setting, hitting) and be able to move around to cover areas of the court. Play should consistently be bump-set-spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location for this volleyball meetup is at the Orient Heights Community Center located at 86 Boardman Street in East Boston. Katya will be hosting these Tuesday night volleyball meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is free if you are a member of Boston Community Centers. If not, it's a one-time $20 membership fee that is good for a year. The Community Center is a walk away from the Orient Heights T Stop on the Blue Line and also has plenty of parking. When you drive up, turn at the Mariott Hotel Sign and park in the lot or further along the fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, please remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Respect the RSVP system (Don't show up expecting to play without a confirmed RSVP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The day before the game, RSVP system is changed to manual. If anyone attending cancels, all the people on the waiting list will get an e-mail. The first person to change their RSVP to "attenging" will get the spot. The day of the game, RSVPs are closed since we only have 12 spots on the court and 14 people signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- If it looks like you won't be able to make it or will run late please cancel your RSVP in time for someone else to join&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
