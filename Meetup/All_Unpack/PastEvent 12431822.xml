We will hike at a pace of our slowest hiker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have our own individual pace and many organizers offer many levels of hiking to give you options of the level and pace that is comfortable for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This will be a Happy Forty and farewell as Tony will now have to move on to the Over Forty Group! LOL! Watch the fun as we will be having Tony perform various tricks as we hike up Mt Jackson! We will then share a warm toast and cake at the Highland center! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be taking the Webster Jackson Trail off of 302 just beyond the AMC Highland Center on the left hand side. This will be an in and out hike five miles total round trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full winter gear a must! We can decide what traction we will use at the trail head.Being prepared, traveling with the appropriate gear &amp;amp; knowing how to use it is your personal responsibility. Test and adjust your gear prior to this trip. Snowshoes,crampons, and micro spikes a must!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!! NO COTTON CLOTHING !! - Cotton (a.k.a. the death cloth) has no place in the mountains. If you arrive wearing cotton clothing you will be turned away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267578295000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264543120000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Jackson  Tony's 40th Birthday</name><id>12431822</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267365600000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12431822/</event_url></item>
