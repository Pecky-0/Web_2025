I strongly advise you to buy your tickets in advance.   This may be a bit crazy.   Last time, the movie sold out pretty quick.  I would like to head in to find seats at 7,  Let's start gathering around&lt;i&gt; 6:45&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok someone had to schedule this meetup....the ultimate chick flick...so here goes!   I strongly recommend that when tickets do become available that you buy in advance.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.  This could get crazy.  We may have to wait in line, so look for me.   If the movie is showing downstairs, which is pretty likely, I will be waiting as close to the ropes near the concession stand as they let me.    If it is upstairs, I will grab a table at the top of the escalators to start, but we will probably need to line up to wait so we can get seats together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ususally go out after the movie to the Rockbottom, which has a full bar, so we can order fun cocktails (like cosmos) instead of beer if we want to in honor of the movie.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss us or we can't all sit together, we will regroup in the hallway after to discuss the movie and get a head count of all who want to go to the brewery.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sex and the City 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: May 27, 2010 &lt;br /&gt;Studio: New Line Cinema (Warner Bros.) &lt;br /&gt;Director: Michael Patrick King &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Michael Patrick King &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Chris Noth, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Jason Lewis, Mario Cantone, Willie Garson &lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sexandthecitymovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sexandthec...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda take another bite out of the Big Apple in the sequel to the 2008 summer blockbuster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a Boston Movie Group Badge</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293825582000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270668698000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sex and the City 2</name><id>13116389</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275173100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/13116389/</event_url></item>
