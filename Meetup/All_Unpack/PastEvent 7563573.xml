This is an excellent band we have enjoyed and wished they played locally more often! Nice dance music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palmer's has been voted 'Best Bar' several times. It's easy to see why! Great drinks reasonably priced, excellent  food, entertainment. and a nice crowd of people. Palmer's is ALWAYS packed! We have joked and said it should  at time be called &amp;quot;The Elbow Room!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Dress light.... it does get warm!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;* NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;I know Andover is quite a distance from the Worcester area. I have added this to the calendar in the event anyone would be interested in joining us.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;_Jo&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Meetup Table Sign on our table(s)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206403626000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>This is a joint event with other meetup groups!
