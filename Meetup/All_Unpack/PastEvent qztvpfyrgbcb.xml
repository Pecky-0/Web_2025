 Open Figure Studio in Lunenburg, MA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(No instruction) &lt;br /&gt;

 The figure models will pose for ten weeks. The model will be available for artists to draw or paint on Monday mornings in the spring. You could paint the figure or do portrait work. We start every class with 20 minutes of gesture drawing. Oil painters are not allowed to use solvents and can only use professional grade walnut oil as their painting medium. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please come 10 minutes early to set up, please don’t be late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday, 9-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Fee for 10 weeks; $180.00, Pay ahead of time &lt;br /&gt;

 Drop in Fee: $22.00, call me to make sure there is room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option: Ed Barron is modeling for two full days on April 29th and May 6th.  The $180 covers 10 mornings.  There is an additional charge of $30 to add these afternoons if you are interested in participating for the full day.   So the total price for adding the extra half days comes to $210 ($180+30).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: &lt;br /&gt;

 Please contact me (Jill) before hand to see if there is room for drop in. &lt;br /&gt;

 Minimum is six people. Let me know ASAP. &lt;br /&gt;
