In this seminar, Mother Clare Watts will teach you to tune into that sense of yours to develop into a deeper and more connected human being. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare Watts is an ordained Priest and Master Teacher in the Order of Christ-Sophia. She began her early training in the late 1970's and was ordained a Minister-Deacon in 1984. She served as such in Kentucky and in Massachusetts, where she was ordained a Priest in 1996 and a Master Teacher in 2001.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare founded the Boston Center of Light, formerly called the Christ-Sophia Center, where she continued to serve until 2001. At that time she moved to Seattle to begin a new Center of Light. Mother Clare has now moved to Dolores Colorado, where she is busy building another Center of Light with Reverend Meira, as well as helping develop the Sophia Peace Center. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare worked as a Certified Professional Midwife for 18 years, having her own midwifery practices in Kentucky and Massachusetts. She received her Masters Degree in 1996 in Counseling Psychology. Mother Clare attended three years of postgraduate training in Jungian Analysis at the Boston Jung Institute.
