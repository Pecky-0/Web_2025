&lt;p&gt;Food safety encompasses the origin, processing and packaging of food so that consumers don&amp;rsquo;t get sick from the food they buy. Increased food production, growing market demand and faster delivery are just three of the many challenges companies face in trying to keep food safe all along the food supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RFID increasingly provides the most effective means to solve these challenges and to ensure compliance with recently enacted legislation designed to protect consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIT Enterprise Forum is bringing together key experts for a panel discussion of the major issues, technologies, and business cases surrounding the RFID-enabled food chain. Come and hear for yourself how RFID is making food safer and food-borne illness easier to trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator: John Greaves, President and CEO, SSI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Greaves has been actively involved in AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data Capture) including RFID for many years. His pioneering work in the area of global logistics, inventory management and the returnable transport Items sector with both active and passive RFID has led to the significant adoptions occurring in supply chains, health care and security.&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;He was the founding chair of the US RFID standards group, led the European Spectrum Initiative, was the leader of the GTAG program for EAN.UCC, and developed &amp;mdash; among many significant RFID implementations worldwide &amp;mdash; the one-tag-per-pallet UHF solution with CHEP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Randy Cronk</member_name><member_id>465168</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323187545000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MITRFID</urlname><id>1547070</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>MITEF of Cambridge RFID Circle (Auto-ID &amp; Sensing Solutions)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321357325000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RFID Protects the Food Chain</name><id>41225682</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323126000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MITRFID/events/41225682/</event_url></item>
