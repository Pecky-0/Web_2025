The next easy water source is about 1 mile after leaving the summit of Bondcliff, but will need to be filtered or otherwise made safe to drink. Water is available at the Guyot shelter, but adds distance and elevation to the hike. We recommend 3 liters per person. This is a hike to pack very light - 19.5 miles is a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Some may choose to trail run the last 5 miles on the Wilderness trail - all are encouraged to hike this last section at their own pace - we will wait in the parking lot until the last participant arrives. Car spotting will be pre-arranged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dogs that are capable of this distance and are well behaved are welcome.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Maybe's will be changed to a NO Friday morning at 8 AM.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob &amp; Geri</member_name><member_id>4842806</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255434582000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254879541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Zealand-Bonds Traverse - ADVANCED due to pace &amp; distance - Dogs are welcome</name><id>11568029</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255261500000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11568029/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/e/6/global_11099862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
