We have 11 more meet ups to plan this year and we would LOVE your input.  What games could we try? Did you hear about an event coming up we could all go to?  Have you seen a fun t.v. program or special you would like to share with the group?  Let's make this the best year ever for our faithful pals because they are the reason we like to get together!  So bring your pooch and all your ideas:  fun or crazy, big or small, and we can have a good time watching the kids play while we chat.  A special treat for any pet whose family brings an idea or suggestion for the Dream Box!      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! Don't forget to bring updated vaccines for: Rabies, DHLLP, &amp;amp; Bordatella!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love &amp;amp; puppy paws,     &lt;br /&gt;Auntie Becky &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Tyngsboro</member_name><member_id>3988390</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295205615000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Medium &amp; Large Breed Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>largedog-36</urlname><id>996656</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>Medium &amp; Large Breed Dog Meetups</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294270577000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>I Have A Dream </name><id>15935171</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295200800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/largedog-36/events/15935171/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/4/c/global_4283196.jpeg</photo_url></item>
