I am president of The American Press Association and an staff photographer for the Marriott Hotels. I think I can offer a meetup that will enlighten, enhance and further the photography skills of its members.  I hope you will join us for our first meetup on Wednesday, February 17th. We will be raffling off photography software and other photography accessories.  Refreshments will be served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first meetup will be focused on photo editing tools and techniques for the professional, or amateur photographer. Discover how to enhance, improve and create amazing portraits, or landscapes, using Photoshop plug-ins.  As staff photographer for the Marriott I have worked with Green Screens to produce portraits of clients in a myriad of settings, without having to relocate them to any location. I will demonstrate the use of this technique and software to achieve it quickly and effortlessly.  I will take you through a complete portrait shoot to demonstrate this method that you can achieve in your own home, or location for very little investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a $15 fee for attending and this can be pre-paid by PayPal, or when you arrive.&lt;br /&gt;The meetups will be held at our home in Littleton, MA.
