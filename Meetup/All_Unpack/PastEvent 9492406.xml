<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>To everyone who wishes to attend this meet and any in the future:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised that nobody actually plays D&amp;amp;D at these meets. They are a venue for people to meet each other and find games to play in. If you are new to D&amp;amp;D, I suggest you attend to find a group or contact other groups on the meetup message board to find great people to play with. Good luck and I hope you have as much fun with this hobby as I have over the last 20 years. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237049529000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231611190000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons February Meetup</name><id>9492406</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234630800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/9492406/</event_url></item>
