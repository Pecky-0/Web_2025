The last time I ate here, I had the lobster ravioli which was a special that night.  It was delicious!  Check out the menu &lt;a href="http://www.marcopoloct.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marcopoloct.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.marcopoloc...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Karaoke doesn't start until 9pm.  The place doesn't really get going until at least 10pm.  A group of us went here the night that we were originally supposed to go to Sally's Fish Camp but ended up at Agave.  After dinner, some of us cruised over to Marco Polo and rocked the house with some lovely renditions of 80s songs.  &lt;br /&gt;If you are joining us for dinner, please keep an eye on your RSVP.  If you want to come but just for karaoke, please RSVP 'no,' but note in your response that you will join us later.  That way, our count for dinner will be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Our reservation will be under Kelly.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208781834000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><why>The food is great here and the service has been good so far.</why><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204748592000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Marco Polo for Dinner and Karaoke</name><id>7471146</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208559600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/7471146/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
