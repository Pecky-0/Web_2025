I was planning on doing this Saturday morning and ended up in NYC all weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would love to do a game night this week and I thought Wednesday would be a good night.  At the moment I only have Scattergories, What If, and Cards, but would be willing to bring any and/or all of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to bring any games you wish. I hear this venue is pretty well-lit and not at all crowded in the evenings. it is in Davis Sq which I know a lot of people are considering to be a good place for meet-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing whoever is coming;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becki&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183158217000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182784073000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Meet-Up @ Mr. Crepe</name><id>5933219</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1182985200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/5933219/</event_url></item>
