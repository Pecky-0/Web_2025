We have decided to form a group to collaborate on improving our &lt;br /&gt;skills &amp;amp; developing usable strategies for Active Trader Pro &amp;amp; Wealth Lab Pro. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our inaugural meeting will take place on Mon January 5, 2009 at 7:00pm&lt;br /&gt;at MIT Building E-51 in the first floor lobby adjacent to the parking lot &lt;br /&gt;entrance. We will begin by discussing how to set up and navigate in these &lt;br /&gt;programs. We will also brainstorm possible profitable strategies that can be &lt;br /&gt;tested. Please familiarize yourself with the programs and bring ideas about &lt;br /&gt;which strategies you would like to test. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the group's DESCRIPTION from our NEW website:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This group is for those interested in learning Active Trader Pro and Wealth &lt;br /&gt;Lab Pro. We will exchange ideas, research strategies for trading including &lt;br /&gt;back testing, buying and selling stocks and options using automated alerts and&lt;br /&gt;auto-execution with both Active Trader Pro and Wealth Lab Pro.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff Orrik</member_name><member_id>1135788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231462429000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Investor$ who think 4 themselve$</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonIBD</urlname><id>81154</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Investor's Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230049869000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Fidelity Users Group</name><id>9380328</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231200000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonIBD/events/9380328/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/9/global_4808969.jpeg</photo_url></item>
