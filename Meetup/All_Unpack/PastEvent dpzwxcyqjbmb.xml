The paths are paved and there's a beach! Teddy and I miss everyone but we cant go to Burrage Pond anymore till the fall. (Poison Ivy would put me out of work). We go every morning around 9. I can go earlier if people want to join us or we can plan on Saturday mornings. Let me know. 19 Fort Hill St in Hingham see map area for specific details on how to get there. I'll meet you all by the gate at 10am on Saturdays. Email me directly if you want to meet on another day of the week.
