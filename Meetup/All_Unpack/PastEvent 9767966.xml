Not only does everyone enjoy one another's cooking, but in these economic times, making one dish to contribute can be a lot cheaper than making a whole meal to eat before the Meetup.  Should you have a favorite game please bring it; otherwise, you know we're well stocked.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats, but they will be locked up for the evening.  &lt;br /&gt;* As we have a new tiny addition to the household, we need to be a little more guarded with whom we invite to the house. &lt;b&gt;You will only be allowed to attend this Meetup if you have already attended 5 Meetups with the group and for at least two of them Liv and/or David were present.&lt;/b&gt; If you haven't attended 5 Meetups with the group (or you have yet to meet Liv or David), we look forward to playing with you at our house once you have. We apologize for the inconvenience, but chalk it up to us being overly-protective new parents.  &lt;br /&gt;* As it is cold and flu season, we do request that if you are ill on the day of the event that you not attend.  &lt;br /&gt;* Parking is available on Lemon St., Cross St., and Northey St.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237850009000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234973913000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck Game Night</name><id>9767966</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237676400000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/9767966/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/5/global_3420677.jpeg</photo_url></item>
