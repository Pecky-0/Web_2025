<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The first sit-down dinner for NEEM will be at a traditional Italian restaurant-Lucia Ristorante. (&lt;a href="http://www.luciaboston.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.luciabosto...&lt;/a&gt;) It's been in the neighborhood for 32 years and has many Italian specialties under the headings of Pasta, Seafood, Chicken, Veal and Steak. Prices range as follows- Antipasti: $4.50-16.95, Pasta: $13.95-18.95, Entrees: $16.50-27.75. You do not have to order any specific number of courses. The restaurant is located on the right-hand side of lower Hanover Street as you're walking toward the waterfront, opposite the fire station. As you enter, take the stairway on the right down one flight. The nearest T-station to the North End is Haymarket. (Orange &amp;amp; Green Lines) For those who can make it, we'll have a cocktail hour to mingle from 6:00-7:00. Then we'll sit down for dinner at 7:00. I'll announce the after-party at dinner. Please make your final RSVP by Tuesday, May 26th at 5:00 PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important: Please access our &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; tab for further guidelines. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be at the near end of the bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>10</waitlist_count><updated>1245873620000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242681771000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lucia Ristorante-Dinner</name><id>10440195</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243465200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/10440195/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/a/global_7834474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
