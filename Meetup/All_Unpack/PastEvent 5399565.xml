And, Mexican director Alfonso Cuarons adaptation of British author P.D. James dystopian novel, one of the true surprises of 2006, has. Set in the year 2027, the human race faces the question, How would we live if there was no future?. This is the question posed by James novel (a world when the last child was born in 2009) and the answer is -not well .Set against a background of Authoritative Government, nationalistic sects, and individual greed and anarchy,  a child is born.  I think that science fiction typically works best when it is an allegory of the times it was made in. So if this be the case, we should have an interesting discussion afterward.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie I will be holding a meetup sign near the front row and then it will be off to a local spot to discuss. The movie is scheduled to start at 1:45.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a complete review:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-children22dec22,0,1800835.story" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.calendarli...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1169491852000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168991933000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Children of Men" at Kendall this Saturday</name><id>5399565</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1169318700000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5399565/</event_url></item>
