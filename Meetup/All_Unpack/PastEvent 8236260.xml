A French box-office phenomenon, Guillaume Canet?s take on &lt;b&gt;Harlen Coben?s best-selling novel&lt;/b&gt; is an energetic blend of Hollywood thrills and French cinematic style. François Cluzet plays a widower who comes under renewed suspicion when his wife?s murder case is re-opened, and receives a mysterious e-mail containing a clue only she would know. What follows is a somewhat convoluted take on the Hitchcockian ?wronged man? format, but one that keeps the thrill-o-meter on high and the suspension of disbelief even more so, largely due to its highly credible cast. Description adapted from BBC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could one of Harlan Coben's good thrillers actually be made into a good film?  It would seem to be a better shot than waiting for the Hollywood release: The film won César awards for Best Director and Best Actor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the film, we'll stop at a local eatery to discuss.  The French Film Festival is usually very popular, and it might be a good idea to get your ticket online before the day of the film.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will be holding a Meetup Sign at the front of the theater, but Tell No One!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217196245000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214692807000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>French Film Festival  - Tell No One</name><id>8236260</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217023200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8236260/</event_url></item>
