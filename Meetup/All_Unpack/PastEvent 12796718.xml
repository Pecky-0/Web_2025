<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I am going to organize two events with the West of Boston over 40 meet-up group on Sat. March 6. &lt;br /&gt;First, will be an 11:00 AM Dog Walk @ Weston Reservoir. &lt;br /&gt;Next, will be a 1:00 PM Nature Walk @ Walden Pond. &lt;br /&gt;Children accompanied by their parent(s) may attend. &lt;br /&gt;I wish dogs were welcome at Walden Pond, but they are not..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walden Pond is located on Rt. 126 off of Rt. 2, between Rt. 2 and Rt. 117. There is plenty of parking, (cost $5.00) in the lot, off of Rt. 126, near the begining of the trail and there are facilities. However, dogs are not welcome. The trail is about 2 miles around the pond. The trail has some ice, snow, and mud, and some dry spots through the tall evergreens. Participants should dress accordingly, with proper footwear, and outerwear for the day's weather forecast. The event will happen, regardless of weather conditions, rain, snow, or shine. (We hope for shine!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a description of the place, excerpted from: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/walden/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now part of the Massachusetts Forests and Parks system, Walden Pond State Reservation includes 462 acres of protected open space so that visitors from near and far may come to experience the pond that inspired Thoreau. In summer the Reservation is a popular swimming destination. In the spring and fall, many people hike the trails that ring the pond and visit the replica of Thoreau's one-room cabin. Year round interpretive programs and guided walks are offered as well as a gift shop, bookstore and the Tsongas gallery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Rte. 495: (North &amp;amp; South West of Boston area) Take exit 29A Onto Rte. 2 East, at 6th set of lights take a right onto Rte. 126 South.
