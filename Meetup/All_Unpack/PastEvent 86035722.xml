This is the second in a proposed week long protest against Yale Vivisection for National Primate Liberation Week 2012. Let's make our presence known on behalf of animals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please spread the word to your animal network and join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale University imprisons, tortures &amp;amp; murders over 150,000 animals including primates, dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, ferrets, rodents, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale experimenters have drilled holes into the skulls of animals, stuck needles into their brains, forced them to consume dangerous drugs including cocaine, and have subjected them to electrical shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is almost no end to the ways that animals suffer in Yale labs before being killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Yale considers this to be a humane and responsible use of animals and experimenters document their abuses in academic papers that boost their careers rather than bring them jail time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us in exposing these Ivy League abusers and in standing up for animals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Leaflets and signs will be provided; but feel free to make your own signs if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know if you need transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information please go to &lt;br /&gt;
