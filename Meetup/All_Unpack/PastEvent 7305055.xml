To be blunt, where's the sex? A lot of Golden Age SF leaves it out. Heck, a large portion of it left out the women! (But let's not go there.) Surely in this enlightened age, SF writers are remembering that grown-ups like other grown-ups in many ways. There are lot more books out there to go through, so let's help each figure this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge: Find an example of Science Fiction book or short story that addresses love, romance, or plain old sex in a grown-up manner. If you can't, find something from another genre, or even (gasp!) a literary novel, that would serve as a worthy model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00 Names. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: Gimme some Love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;Open Discussions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205355227000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202681372000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers March Meeting</name><id>7305055</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1205010000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/7305055/</event_url></item>
