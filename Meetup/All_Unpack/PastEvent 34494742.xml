&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Donnie Darko - Directors Cut&lt;/strong&gt; (2001 - Psychological Thriller - 133 Min, Rated R)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/"&gt;IMDB Description:&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A troubled teenager is plagued by visions of a large bunny rabbit that manipulates him to commit a series of crimes, after narrowly escaping a bizarre accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AJ's Comments:&amp;nbsp; I have not seen this in years, but was inspired when I saw the Blu-ray of Directors cut cheap at Walmart.&amp;nbsp; The film's ticket sales in the U.S. were hurt by its release very close to 9/11, however it has developed a Cult following since from those whom have found it and did earn quite a bit more in the European cinemas.&amp;nbsp; Despite not even breaking even on the world wide box office &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/donnie_darko/"&gt;it scores favorably on Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event start time is 7:00 for the social portion, so you can start showing up then. But we will not start the film until 7:45 or shortly there after, but don't plan to be any later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use the waiting list. If someone else backs out you can be automatically added, just provide your full&amp;nbsp;name for the concierge as a contingency please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Snacks:&lt;/span&gt; Bring your own Snacks and Beverages. (Just Please be careful and responsible.) Sharing is encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Getting in:&lt;/span&gt; Enter the building through the State Street Entrance (Between the intersections of State with Court and Chapel) and talk to the Concierge, there are &lt;span&gt;instructions near&lt;/span&gt; the call box and a bell button on it if the door is locked. If you really have trouble, pre-movie-start time you can call AJ at 315-345-9348&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Parking:&lt;/span&gt; There is metered street parking available near by on Orange Street and Court Street.&amp;nbsp; If you don't mind the longer walk, some of the Yale Lots are free in the evening/weekends. (I.E. Yale lot 51 on Temple Street.) 360's Parking Garage is open to visitors for Credit Card Customers only, the entrance is on State Street just to the Right of the building main entrance. Other local near by businesses may have open parking, however you're on your own there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't think I really need to say this, but: This is basically an extension of my home I'm inviting you into, there for I expect everyone will treat it with respect and not risk future events (or my lease).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come to the building door, Ring the Bell Button, Concierge will Direct you.
