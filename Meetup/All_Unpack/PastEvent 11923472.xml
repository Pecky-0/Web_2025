Tom, Field &amp;amp; Willey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin our day at the Avalon Trailhead located at the Crawford Depot just south of the AMC Highland Center. We ascend Mt. Tom via the Avalon, A-Z &amp;amp; Mt. Tom spur trails. From the summit of Tom we follow the Willey Range trail over the summits of Mt. Field &amp;amp; Willey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should the snowpack be deep we will retrace our steps back to our cars located near the Highland Center. If the snowpack is not very deep we may descend via the Willey Range &amp;amp; Kedron Flume trails to a spotted car. This decision will be made on the morning of this hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please add your name to the waiting list and I will contact you for more information regarding your winter hiking experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** IMPORTANT NOTES *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is categorized as advanced and is not for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any changes or cancellations will be expressed to hikers that have RSVP'd &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; for this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please arrive early and be prepared to start at the designated time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions.
