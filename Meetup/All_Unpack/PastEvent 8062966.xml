<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will be going through the Liturgy of the Eucharist as performed in the Johannite tradition point by point, with detailed information about each of the parts of the sacrament. We will also discuss the history and nature of the sacraments in general, Johannite sacraments in specific, and their relationships to other Christian traditions, occult practices, and social festivals.&lt;br /&gt;We will first have our discussion and then we'll experience the Liturgy together. All are welcome to either or both. We have made arrangements with the Theosophical Society in Boston to be the new home of St. Sarah's Parish. Our church has a lot in common with the Society, so I think it's a great fit for us. Visit their website for directions at the bottom of the page.&lt;br /&gt;As always, please contact me with any comments or questions. Also, this venue is a little more expensive than places we've been previously, so if you are willing and able, please bring $5 or whatever you are comfortable with so that we can make use of this great space.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk in the front door and follow the hallway to the end.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
