I know this limits the available time and possibly precludes grabbing a bite or drink afterwards, but hopefully you'll stop by on your way home from work and feed your arty self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cristin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Points of View celebrates photographic diversity. Photographs on display include works by four photographers with distinctive points of view reaching out to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Cummings first showed at Panopticon Gallery in 2006. The Seattle, Washington based photographer is a graduate of the Art Institute of Boston. Katherines photographs are one step removed from reality, depicting dioramas in two distinct series of work: Miniatures are images of dioramas of everyday life in which sheâ€¦ â€œisolate&lt;s&gt; that one single moment between characters and their environment. My photographs are about the lives of these people, their relationships and the place where they liveâ€?.&lt;br /&gt;Her Natural History series reflect dioramas in natural history museums, portraying animals in&lt;br /&gt;their natural environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny Ellerbe is a native of Louisiana who declaresâ€¦ â€œNearly all of my photographs are taken within sixty miles of home... â€œ It is a place that nurtured me through childhood, confined me as a young adult and called me home every time I moved awayâ€?. Her photographs are exquisitely crafted landscapes in the tradition of Ansel Adams. The prints are modest in size, usually 9x14â€? or smaller â€“ inviting closer, intimate viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neal Rantoul has been photographing and teaching photography (Northeastern University) for over 30 years. His photographs combine the tradition of large format photography with the technology of digital imaging. This exhibit includes recent work&lt;br /&gt;from a project documenting taxidermy and the natural paintings featured in the national outdoor clothing and sporting goods retail chain: Cabelaâ€™s. Like Cummings, there is a separation from reality in the diorama-like settings, but the reality of the commercial background is an integral part of his images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Thompson was born on an army base in Virginia, and raised in Morocco, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Belgium. A traveler since birth, she is a graduate of the School of Visual Communication at Ohio University and the recipient of a Fulbright Grant. Amy Thompson works in the documentary tradition and has photographed the human condition in Cambodia, Morocco, and in rural America. Collectively, her photographs tell stories and document places; individually they are works of poetic art. Thompson teaches photography at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston, MA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.panopt.com/exhibitions.php" target="_blank"&gt;Exhibit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a last minute work event &amp; won't be there :-(.
