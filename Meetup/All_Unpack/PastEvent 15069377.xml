Allow extra time for parking. In case anyone is late, we'll wait 15 minutes.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who's hosting? &lt;br /&gt;Gale_2 &lt;br /&gt;Come join the fun at Newburyport's Fall Festival this Monday October 11 -- it's a holiday for lots of folks. There will be FREE concerts (rock from 60s and 70s) on the waterfront and in Market Square, artisans will be displaying/selling crafts and art, there will be lots of food vendors from local restaurants, and more. It's from 10 to 5. We're going to meet at noon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking -- There's a municipal lot with 3-hour parking, but it gets filled REAL early. If you drive past that lot (which will be on your right), there is a large &amp;quot;pay&amp;quot; parking lot on the left. It's about a 5-minute walk to Market Square.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>in front of Monkey's fist Clothing Store, in Market Square</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gale_2</member_name><member_id>10931980</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286817666000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286782515000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Newburyport Fall Festival</name><id>15069377</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286812800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/15069377/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/4/global_18198436.jpeg</photo_url></item>
