We will wait for everyone and go at a slow pace if need be, so I am estimating that this approximate 4 mile hike could take 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  We will take breaks as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At just under 500 feet above sea level, Buck Hill has some great views and is one of the most rugged spots in this hilly, wooded area south of Boston. The summit of this broad, round hill is mostly treeless, allowing for nearly 360-degree views including the the Boston skyline and the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please park at the parking lot across the street from the State Police Station.  Of course please bring water and a snack or two.  Email me if you have any questions.
