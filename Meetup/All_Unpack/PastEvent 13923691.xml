In 1775, Paul Revere crossed over to Charlestown to begin his famous Midnight Ride, the colonists stood up to the British army at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and Charlestown was burned to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;Tour this urban enclave that was founded in 1628 we will discuss the early Puritan settlement, view the Bunker Hill monument and learn about many of Charlestown's distinguished citizens which have included John Harvard and Samuel Morse.  Not to mention, this tour includes the amazing Gen. Joseph Warren - the most migratory corpse in Boston's history - who started that journey in Charlestown.&lt;br /&gt;Meet your guide outside Gate 1 of the Charlestown Navy Yard. Tour costs $12 (but card-carrying members of Boston By Foot pay just $5.
