All levels of crafters are invited to attend. Assistance will be available for the following types of projects: knitting &amp;amp; crochet, cross stitch &amp;amp; needlepoint, and crewel &amp;amp; embroidery. Meetings are held on the last Saturday of the month, 2:00 - 4:00pm, starting March 28th, 2009 in the conference room of the new Northborough Public Library. Please join us, there is nothing like the camraderie of fellow crafters when starting or finishing a project!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the conference room.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne Marie</member_name><member_id>8939563</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240684272000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Knitters and stitchers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1389430</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6500015259</group_lon><name>Knitting &amp; Needlework in the Boroughs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237394243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Northborough Knitting &amp; Needlework</name><id>9981034</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238263200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group/events/9981034/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/3/a/global_7731898.jpeg</photo_url></item>
