I went last year and it was a lot of fun. Its usually pretty crowded. Since its going to be hard to find one another, I will e-mail out my cell phone number to the yeses and maybes a few days before the event. I don't have chairs but I'll bring some extra blankets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a blurb from their web site: &amp;quot;Bring your blankets and lawn chairs for a fun filled fall day of bluegrass music featuring &amp;quot;Southern Rail.&amp;quot;. Great views, great foliage, great food, great brews and great wine make this a day not to be missed. Enjoy some of Nashoba Valley Winery's best beers while you listen to live music cascading from our picturesque gazebo. And of course, apple picking, apple pie eating contests and tasty caramel apples are all part of the fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is their web site if you want more information: &lt;a href="http://www.nashobawinery.com/festivals.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nashobawin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a joint event with the Acton Social Network Group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call me on my cell phone when you get there</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226194207000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223070561000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nashoba Valley Winery Bluegrass Festival</name><id>8891221</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225036800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/8891221/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/3/global_1218899.jpeg</photo_url></item>
