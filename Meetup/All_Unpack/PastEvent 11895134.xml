Rise&amp;amp;Fall is a revolutionary art and music event commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Part art installation and part DJ event, Rise&amp;amp;Fall features artwork displayed from 19 countries and 19 states on Kodak digital frames interpreting the theme &amp;quot;breaking down barriers&amp;quot; and music performed by renowned Turkish-German DJ/Producer, DJ Ipek Ipekcioglu. Her performances are the embodiment of contemporary Germany, smashing musical, cultural and social barriers through an eclectic mix of Middle Eastern sounds and good ol' Berlin Electro. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event comes from Sophie - thanks for informing me! Sounds like a pretty interesting happening to me, so go check it out who can! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely drop by to see the exhibition, but don't know the time yet, as I have other obligations already, but please feel free to go to the Tazza-Bar on your own and enjoy yourself! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Es gruesst euch, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258945818000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258475422000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rise and Fall Event -  20th Anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall!</name><id>11895134</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258772400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/11895134/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
