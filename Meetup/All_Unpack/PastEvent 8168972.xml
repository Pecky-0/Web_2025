Expose the 9-11 Cover-up.&lt;br /&gt;2. Expose Foreign Control of the Federal Reserve.  &lt;br /&gt;3. Expose Foreign Takeover of all U.S. Property&lt;br /&gt;4. Expose U.S. Detention Centers built to House Citizens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Susan is asked to address other issues (such as abortion, environment, healthcare, etc) she will address them in brief terms (1 or two sentences) that are designed to redirect attention back to the above two issues whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone helping to collect signatures for Susan Allen's campaign will be encouraged to wear 9-11 gear, hand out 9-11 literature and offer DVDs to voters. (Please keep all DVDs and literature focused on the campaign's two main issues.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free &amp;quot;Investigate 9-11&amp;quot; T shirt will be awarded to any/all petitioners who fill up a petition sheet for Susan's campaign. (That's 25 signatures.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact me if you can join in on the fun. If you need DVDs and/or literature, let us know.  With your help, we can put a truly bold 9-11 Truth candidate on the ballot this year!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please rsvp.&lt;br /&gt;Peace!&lt;br /&gt;Waldo&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Whole Foods Market, corner of Beacon and Walnut Street, Newton</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 4883658</member_name><member_id>4883658</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214230088000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213831814000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Petitioning this weekend for the Susan Allen Congressional  Campaign</name><id>8168972</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214056800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/8168972/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/3/6/global_981894.jpeg</photo_url></item>
