This riveting documentary is the first extensive look at the culture behind China's Cultural Revolution (1964-76). Few events in history affected as many people. Millions suffered and an untold number of other died, yet the Cultural Revolution remains misunderstood. Using rare archival footage and clips from Communist propaganda films of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, Morning Sun is a multi-perspective history of this tumultuous period as seen through the eyes of members of the generation born around 1949-during the foundation of the People's Republic of China-who came of age in the 1960s. Carma Hinton, who herself is a member of this generation, will discuss the film and the historical events from her unique perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater during the credits so we can head off to a local cafe and discuss the film.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179153441000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178656058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Morning Sun</name><id>5756465</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178980200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5756465/</event_url></item>
