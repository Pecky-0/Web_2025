<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We are really enjoying our time with Schopenhauer, some of us need to catch up with the reading, some of us would like to re-read what we already have read, Schopenhauer seemingly provides plenty of points for engagement. For all these reasons we have decided that at this meeting we will again discuss Book IV of Volume 1 of The World as Will and Representation. Our plan is to spend one more meeting after this on Schopenhauer when the text will be his critic of Kantian philosophy in the appendix of Volume 1 of The World as Will and Representation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please ask for the philosophy group from the stuff.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249601364000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246626403000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Representation V</name><id>10795558</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247785200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/10795558/</event_url></item>
