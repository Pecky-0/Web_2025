Leon's has a great water view and a large variety of food selections to choose from. The menu includes a raw bar, salads, pasta, steak and chops and fish dishes. &lt;a href="http://www.leonsofnewhaven.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Their web site - www.leon'sofnewhaven.com.&lt;/a&gt; After dinner Timeless, a local 70s band that does Classic Dance tunes will be performing. They are great to watch but really get people on their feet dancing. I've seen this band and since I got up and danced, they know how to play their music. If your going to have dinner and stay for the band afterwards, you only have to sign up on this site. The band is scheduled to start 9:30pm. &lt;a href="http://www.timelessct.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Go to their web site here. &lt;/a&gt; This is sure to be a night of great food and a fantastic band with a group of friendly people.  Sign up here for dinner so we could plan seating.  Sign up on the next meetup if you are only going for the dancing.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Annette's table with PartyExpress</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annette</member_name><member_id>2905200</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve C</member_name><member_id>6197158</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367846179000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
