I am pretending to be Susan this Friday. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you then, &lt;br /&gt;Lopa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black pants and a green shirt.  I will wait till 7:15 pm and if you arrive after you will have to come find me. :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Opal</member_name><member_id>3394775</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337369907000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Because Because Because of the wonderful things it does ....</why><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208196594000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Suddenly Susan</name><id>7737830</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208559600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/7737830/</event_url></item>
