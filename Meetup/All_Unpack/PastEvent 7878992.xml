We'll split up into games after a bit and play until 10ish.  Then we head out for snacks (it's going to be warm, so possibly ice cream) so you can chat with your teammates, opponents, and super-stinky organizers in the light.  Then we go home, and it's super-sad, because we have to wait a whole THREE DAYS before we see each other again.  On the plus side, Jim and Amy might take that time to shower.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be the coolest (and probably only) people on Cambridge Common, over by the softball field, tossing an Illuminated Frisbee.
