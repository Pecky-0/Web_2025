Simon and Louie are missing their frenchie buddies since we were out of town.  So if you want to join for fun we'll be in the smaller fenced in area at noon but not sure after that pending set up with the picnic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fee involved-just wanted to give everybody an opportunity to mingle while the weather is still wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you join us!&lt;br /&gt;Terri, Simon &amp;amp; Louie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We all look like our pics</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223736492000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222138093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doggie Picnic at Peter's Park</name><id>8813113</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223136000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/8813113/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/1/global_381217.jpeg</photo_url></item>
