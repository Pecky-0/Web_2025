Greenwood Park has been suggested as a meeting place... I don't know the Worcester area very well myself, but I'd love for the NEBBC to have a greater presence there... Worcester DOES have the &amp;quot;muzzled in public&amp;quot; law; members are encouraged to abide by the laws... If you know of a place close to that area that DOESN'T require your pit bull to be muzzled in public, please feel free to suggest it... This event would be a casual event; Saturdays at 11a, something like that, for members to get together at Greenwood Park, and walk your dogs together! (Our Friday walk usually lasts around an hour, give or take...). ALL breeds welcome. No flexi/extendable leashes please. On-leash pack walk. Represent responsibly! Please click &amp;quot;attend&amp;quot; and feel free to suggest a date if you are interested in getting this together! *Thanks Jenn for emailing me!* -Cassie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320607228000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318991430000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greenwood Park, Worcester Walking Group?</name><id>37906422</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320602400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/37906422/</event_url></item>
