Groups from Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are invited! The afternoon&amp;nbsp;begins with an optional Spaziergang along a river rail trail followed by happy hour/dinner at the gourmet adorable Vienna Restaurant, all while enjoying German conversation.&amp;nbsp;Many people love the Vienna Restaurant with its German/Austrain cuisine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant should be lovely.&amp;nbsp; It's in an elegant old inn with fireplaces etc. The Spaziergang starts at 1:30 along what was intended to be an extension of the Grand Trunk Railroad.&amp;nbsp; The train never came, but the land, river and trail are there for us to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
