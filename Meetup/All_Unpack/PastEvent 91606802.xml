&lt;p&gt;If interested, I suggest buying tickets in advance as early as possible here: &lt;a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;amp;eventId=4558365" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;amp;eventId=4558365&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can decide to go for dinner somewhere before the concert. For the concert, we'll meet at Scullers at 9:45PM. Please note there is a $10 charge to park so it may be good to carpool and divide the charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is information on the concert from Scullers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARTURO SANDOVAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted political asylum in July 1990 and US citizenship in 1999, Sandoval and his family now call Miami, Florida home. A protégé of the legendary jazz master Dizzy Gillespie, Sandoval was born in Artemisa, a small town in the outskirts of Havana, Cuba, on November 6, 1949, just two years after Gillespie became the first musician to bring Latin influences into American Jazz. Sandoval began studying classical trumpet at the age of twelve, but it didn’t take him long to catch the excitement of the jazz world. He has since evolved into one of the World’s most acknowledged guardians of jazz trumpet and flugel horn, as well as a renowned classical artist, pianist and composer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaloyan Tanev</member_name><member_id>7696644</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353761575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Jazz Fans/Musicians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>jazz-190</urlname><id>1202977</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Cambridge/Somerville/Boston Jazz Meetup/Jam</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353030171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Go to Arturo Sandoval Concert</name><id>91606802</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>8100000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353725100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/jazz-190/events/91606802/</event_url></item>
