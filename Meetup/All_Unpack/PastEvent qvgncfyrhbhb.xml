When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy’s hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to the question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the 6:30 regular (not 3D) version.  Please arrive no later than 6:15.  This is opening weekend so I suggest you get there early to purchase your tickets.  We will be moving into the theater no later than 6:15 so we can try to find seats together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested, perhaps we can go out for a bite or a drink afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
