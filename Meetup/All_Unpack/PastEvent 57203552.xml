Dr. Malik believes that most of a mother&amp;rsquo;s anxiety, worry, depression and fatigue are a result of the non-stop work of motherhood: work that is invisible. We mother in a culture that is broken around love and connection, and we lack a language to respect and honor a mother&amp;rsquo;s work of love. Every mother is doing her best, but notices only what she is not doing. We don&amp;rsquo;t talk enough about the complexity of love, and how to navigate this emotion.
