Either way, let's forget about &amp;quot;Diet Month&amp;quot; for one morning and indulge ourselves with the most delicious breakfast pastries I've found in the greater Boston area! What you see in the picture is a &amp;quot;kringle,&amp;quot; one of the signature pastries at the Danish Pastry House, where you can also get a large assortment of teas and coffee drinks to accompany it. This place doesn't take reservations and gets very crowded on Sundays, which is why I thought of going there on a Saturday morning. Why not start our weekend off on a sugar high?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can be persuaded to push the time back to 10 a.m if people request it but I think we will have a better chance of snagging a large table if we shoot for 9:30.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Meetup tent card on the largest table I can find</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264430373000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263850751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Go Danish for Breakfast</name><id>12355306</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264257000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/12355306/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/5/global_12692181.jpeg</photo_url></item>
