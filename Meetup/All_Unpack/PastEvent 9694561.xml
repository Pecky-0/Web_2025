Show starts at 8. This place always fills up, so arrive early to make sure you get in. The comedy is amateur but usually really funny, and the scorpion bowls are delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ONLY RSVP IF YOU ARE DEFINITELY COMING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Take the Red Line to Harvard Square and it's just a few blocks away. Parking in garages or on street if you are lucky!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235520280000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234035751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Comedy @ the Hong Kong</name><id>9694561</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235262600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/9694561/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/0/global_5172336.jpeg</photo_url></item>
