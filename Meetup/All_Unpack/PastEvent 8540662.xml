We'll be on the water for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take 395 to exit 4B (Sutton Ave - Oxford Ctr).  At the end of the offramp you have to go right.  Stay straight on this road.  The entrance to the boat ramp parking area is 2.9 miles from the end of the offramp and will be on the left.  Just before the boat ramp entrance there is a horse farm on the right, and a sign that says &amp;quot;Launching Ramp&amp;quot;.  The entrance to the ramp is directly across from the entrance to the &amp;quot;Buffamville Park&amp;quot; picnic area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to the launch area, go to the back of the parking lot and turn right.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222655717000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218680218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak/Canoe Buffamville Reservoir</name><id>8540662</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221404400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/8540662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
