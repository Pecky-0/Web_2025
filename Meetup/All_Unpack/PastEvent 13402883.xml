Hope all is well and that you are all enjoying this fabulous weather we've been having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll hold our May Pug Meetup on Sunday, May 23rd from 11:00am - 1:00pm.  We'll go outside in the yard if it's not raining.  Anyone attending for the first time, please check in at the front and bring vaccination records for rabies, distemper and canine cough (bordatella, kennel cough).  It can be as simple as a receipt from  your vet showing when the vaccines are next due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone wishing to schedule a grooming for after the meetup, please call so we can make an appointment.  This just makes sure that the groomer is still here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested, we'll be finishing a group training class in two weeks.  Anyone interested in the next class, please call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agni&lt;br /&gt;781.245.1237&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Agni</member_name><member_id>8450793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274737851000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pug Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Pug-Lovers</urlname><id>1340523</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Pug Lovers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273152604000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MAY MEETUP</name><id>13402883</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274626800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Pug-Lovers/events/13402883/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/3/1/global_7475937.jpeg</photo_url></item>
