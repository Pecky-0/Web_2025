Come to the screening of &lt;i&gt;Koolhaas Houselife&lt;/i&gt; at 7:00 pm on Thursday, April 2 at the Seaport World Trade Center and experience the daily intimacy of a house in Bordeaux designed by Rem Koohaas. This charming and unique film has received limited North American distribution. Brian Healy AIA, moderator of the BSA's &amp;quot;Conversations on Architecture&amp;quot; program, hosts the screening which is only $25 ($10 for students).
