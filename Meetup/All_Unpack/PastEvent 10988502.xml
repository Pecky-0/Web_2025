<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi to everyone in the group....it is time to get to know one another and listen to different ideas and agendas. I want to make this as profitable as possible, but I also want to create an opportunity to get to know one another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goals for this meetup are basic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). Establish a core group with several co-organizers to help share the load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). Determine priorities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3). Assure members that we have what it takes to make a statement, to make a difference in Nothern CT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not done so already, please register with &amp;quot;Evite&amp;quot; (www.evite.com). I will do an emailing through this site as well as through evite if I can. This will be a pot luck event. I will buy what I can afford, but please bring anything that you can by way of food and beverages. This first event will be experimental, but I'm sure it will get better as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Location is my home: 183 Broad Brook Road, Enfield, CT 06082 Contact me:(860) 749-5961&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks in advance for your participation and cooperation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In patriotism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252165250000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248906450000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Get Busy!!!</name><id>10988502</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251572400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/10988502/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/f/global_9746095.jpeg</photo_url></item>
