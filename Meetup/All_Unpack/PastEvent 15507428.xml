You'll love this beautiful park!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ellisville Harbor State Park&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you pile the mashed potatoes too high? Eat one too many slices of pumpkin pie? Did the gravy boat&lt;br /&gt;overflow onto your plate? Come out for a briskly paced hike to burn off some of those turkey dinner calories! Please bring water and be prepared to cover 2 - 3 miles of moderate difficulty trails including walking along the sandy beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the dirt parking lot off Route 3A (between Davis Road and Ellisville Road) in Plymouth. Program is free and open to the public. For adults and older children who can walk at a moderate to fast pace. Rain cancels. For more information, call Amy at (508) 272-9376. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For park information &amp;amp; directions, visit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/southeast/ells.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/southeast/ells.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike is sponsored by the MA Department of Conservation and Recreation and will be led by our favorite DCR  Interpreter, Amy.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Amy.
