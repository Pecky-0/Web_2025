Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.  This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.   I thought that we would bike for about two to three hours, with many breaks/stops along the way. Please pack a snack to enjoy when we take an extended break on the shore.  &lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 1:00 pm in the first lot south of the park entrance which is on Route 1A in Rye NH.    There are paved and unpaved trails. Most are in good conditions.  The best sights are from the non paved trails, as they bring you along the shore and wooded areas.  The paved trail is rather short, and run along the road which does not have much scenery to look at.  I definitely recommend that mountain or hybrid bicycle be used for this event. &lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring your sunscreen, insect repellent and plenty of fluids.&lt;br /&gt;This event is at no cost, unless you choose to park in the State Park parking lot.    I hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling options.  Because this event is so far out of our area, it may be a good idea if some of us car pool, and offer to bring others’ bike, if we can.  I have room for one bike on my bike rack, first call first served.  If you want to offer to bring someone’s bike, all you have to do is enter a to that effect along with your cell phone number.  This way you can be contacted for arrangements. &lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  Ordione State Park&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286712907000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286140784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy Biking at Ordione State Park</name><id>14986554</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286643600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/14986554/</event_url></item>
