&amp;gt; &amp;gt; On thursday, September 27 at 4:30, the FCA/FPA will be joint hosting an event for their Business After Hours at KFIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; We will need some cooks and clean up crew. As well as pilots. This is a great way for us to get the local business leaders down here for a ride and meet-n-greet a real pilot :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can set up in front of the terminal facing taxiway. Encompassing the grass area. Set up tent and then grille to the side. I expect we'll need about 3 cooks, 4 set up and clean up, 6 pilots. More are welcome. NCMCC has just started promoting this. They charge a fee for this event (not us of course :-)) &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; The FCA is the Chamber member, but the FPA needs to make ourselves known to them also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

"... The Fitchburg Pilot's Association and FCA Flight School welcome you to join us for a night of good food, fun and flights! Parking available in front of the terminal. Event will be held at the terminal with flights available for all attendees (weather permitting). Please arrive early to ensure you get your chance in the air!..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; I don't expect attendance to be as big as one of our large meetings, under 100 or so. I'll post it for helpers/set up/pilots. &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; This is a great event and long time coming for us. &lt;br /&gt;
