With a career spanning sixteen years, Gehman has performed, danced and written about bellydancing with expertise, having danced in film, TV and music videos (running the gamut from Madonna to Arabic superstars abroad). Drawing inspiration from classical forms of the dance, her adventurous, open-minded enthusiasm translates from personality to performance; a purveyor of interesting combinations of style fusion, Gehman has sparked controversy within the bellydance community by introducing elements of burlesque into some of her routines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring the trials and tribulations of career bellydancers, the art is personified with a cast of quirky, interesting, and positively powerful women including Margaret Cho. Granting the audience on-stage and off-stage access, Underbelly serves as confessional, portraiture, and informative history of one of the oldest forms of dance in the world. Filmed in Los Angeles and directed by Steve Balderson, Underbelly inconspicuously chronicles the day-to-day of the scene with a rhythm as mesmerizing as the performances it showcases.
