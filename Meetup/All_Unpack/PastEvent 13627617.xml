As a matter of fact, as recently as six months earlier, there had been no such thing as the South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group: breakfast at The Wildflower Cafe in Duxbury was only our seventh event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was our first breakfast Meetup, and also a first in another way: It was the first Meetup that Mike helped to run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, in a sense, where Mike came in.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Your votes in our &amp;quot;W&amp;quot; poll tell us that you want SSDOMG to go back there, and we're happy to oblige, because Wildflower still serves tasty comfort food in a fun, cottagey atmosphere in a space tucked into a row of businesses in Duxbury's commercial district. Unassuming from the outside, it turns out to be a place worth knowing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this trip, we'll be taking advantage of the opportunity to have dinner there (they only serve it four nights a week). Since this is a smaller venue than some, we are limiting attendance to ten diners.  Please join us as we return to a place we first visited when SSDOMG itself was just starting to bud. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wildflower: The Return&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, June 30th @ 6:30pm &lt;br /&gt;The Wildflower Cafe &lt;br /&gt;8 Chestnut Street &lt;br /&gt;Duxbury, MA 02331 &lt;br /&gt;781-934-7814 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting Location:&lt;/b&gt; Outside the front door if it's nice out. We will then go in together as a Group. Otherwise, inside the Lobby. If you arrive after we are seated ask for the Meetup Group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: This restaurant does not accept reservations but we are able to call-ahead.  We may have to wait a couple minutes to be seated.  Please keep in mind this restaurant closes @ 8pm so if you will be more than 1/2 hr late this may not be the event for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Organizer(s):&lt;/b&gt; Mike and Angela &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Min/Max:&lt;/b&gt; Min of 6 people by 7pm on Monday, June 28th. Max of 10 people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Up to one per member. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fees:&lt;/b&gt; Annual Members - FREE, Group Members - $2, Mid-Year Annual Membership is $10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; 8pm on Tuesday, June 29th. Any changes made after this time may not be seen by an Event Organizer and will be considered a No-Show per our guidelines on the About Us page.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash Only Policy:&lt;/b&gt; Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over three years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the wait staff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inclement Weather:&lt;/b&gt; TBD - Please see our Weather policy on the About page (scroll to the bottom and click on &amp;quot;Weather&amp;quot;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;From Rt 3, take Exit 10 and head north on Rt 3A; i.e., take a right off the ramp from Rt 3 North (coming from Cape Cod), a left off the ramp from Rt 3 South(coming from Braintree/Boston). You should almost immediately pass through a small cluster of businesses including Bennet Gas on your right. Note that if you come to a traffic light and see a mall with a Hannaford supermarket and an Ocean State Job Lot straight across from you, you've gone the wrong way off the ramp and need to turn around!&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Travel distance on Rt 3A is just about 1.5 miles. Shortly before you turn off Rt. 3A you'll see (on your right) a playground behind a chain link fence. Also on your right at this point you'll note a yellow, diamond-shaped sign reading &amp;quot;School Bus Stop Ahead&amp;quot; and another with a symbol denoting a pedestrian crossing. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Watch carefully on your right because you will quickly come to Chestnut St. The Milepost Restaurant is on the near right corner and signs indicate that Rt 3A bears left, while a right turn goes to S. Duxbury. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Go right onto Chestnut and follow it until it ends in the Business District. You will clearly see Duxbury Wine &amp;amp; Spirits straight ahead, as well as a tall flagpole. The building on your right, just before you enter the intersection, houses four businesses, including Halls Corner Store, Empire Cleaners, Duxbury Village Realtors and (farthest to the right) The Wildflower Cafe. You're there! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Angela</member_name><member_id>341074</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike</member_name><member_id>3444655</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278025669000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>South Shore Diners</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssdomg</urlname><id>313308</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275084291000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wildflower: The Return</name><id>13627617</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277937000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/events/13627617/</event_url></item>
