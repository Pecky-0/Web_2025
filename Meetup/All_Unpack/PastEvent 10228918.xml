<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>As developers we tend to spend most of our time working on the functionality of the Flex / AIR applications, but not so much on the look or style. Let's face it, the default Flex theme 'Halo' can be boring to look at every day. However, thankfully we have several options in how we can spruce up our applications with ease. We can use CSS or even develop our own Flex theme. In our April meeting, we'll spend some time going over the various ways we can make Flex look sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Presenter:&lt;br /&gt;John Mason manages the Online Flex User Group.
