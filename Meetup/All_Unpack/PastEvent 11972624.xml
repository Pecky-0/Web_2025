Robina is a fast-talking, clear-minded teacher who uses humor and straight talk to convey her message. In this talk she explains that our addiction and neediness to getting what we want, in the way we want it, becomes a recipe for suffering. We will also include a short meditation and discussion as part of this evening's gathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us as we gather in community to explore mindfulness and meditation. All levels of meditators are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259795705000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259505199000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Addiction versus Freedom</name><id>11972624</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259622000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/11972624/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/c/global_12020380.jpeg</photo_url></item>
