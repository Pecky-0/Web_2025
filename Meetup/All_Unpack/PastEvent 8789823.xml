I'm sure many of you have seen him before, but he always puts on a solid, high energy show!  I am trying to find out asap, how many of you would be interested in going to see him....I used to hang out with him after a few of his shows in Denver, where he has a partial residency.  I will see about getting in touch with him and his crew before the show, to try and get some extra, vip treatment for the group, a possible discount on advanced tickets, or maybe even a pre-show meet up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>tbd</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Felix J</member_name><member_id>7410281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237515384000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Househeads</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonhousemusic</urlname><id>861021</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston's House Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221825551000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BAD BOY BILL/ALEX PEACE/STEVE SMOOTH</name><id>8789823</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223074800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonhousemusic/events/8789823/</event_url></item>
