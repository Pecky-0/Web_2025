But that is nothing compared to the high wing / low wing rivalry we have here at KFIT &lt;br /&gt;

Now I am sure there is a way to solve this hmmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a bout a friendly race to see who is faster or can maneuver better or out perform &lt;br /&gt;

But……………&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

ON THE GROUND,,,,,, YA! A GO CART RACE!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THAT’S THE TICKET! &lt;br /&gt;

FUN &lt;br /&gt;

EXCITING &lt;br /&gt;

JUVINILE &lt;br /&gt;

JUST UP OUR ALLEY… juvenile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is we can FLY there. Ya, Ya flyin is the best part, but I still can kick your but on the cart race. Yes this is a challenge!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So buckle up and take off on Wednesday to KEEN where a private van will pick you up at your aircraft and transport you to the racetrack ( just like Petty) where your personal race cart will be warmed up and ready to go. We will each do 2 races to see who is the best hands down! &lt;br /&gt;

The winner gets free water at the victory dinner that will be held at &lt;br /&gt;

Papagallos Restaurant &amp;amp; Grotto Lounge in Keene. &lt;br /&gt;

Followed by another best part the flight home to KFIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheels up at 6 pm &lt;br /&gt;

Race shortly after landing &lt;br /&gt;

Dinner to follow&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Bortle</member_name><member_id>6715847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346414278000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345857553000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rodger Petty, Kyle Bush, Don Gartlets….
