Today whilst in Scooters Go Green, someone showed me what looks to be a great ride around the 127 to Rockport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said it looked great but would not get the same experience if i just did it on my own. Then it hit me. I joined this group for a reason lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who would be up to a trip from Boston to Rockport around the 127? Im sure that someone all ready knows the route, but if it is of interest to plenty of people to actually become reality I'm more than prepared to make some effort to plan a safe and fun route. Im new here in the US, so i might actually get us all lost but hey you don't know until you try huh :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340391617000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Scooterists, scooter, scoot</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonScoots</urlname><id>1509243</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>Boston Scoots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339099652000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Road trip around Rockport</name><id>68204502</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340379900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonScoots/events/68204502/</event_url></item>
