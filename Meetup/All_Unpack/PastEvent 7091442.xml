Since we want you to come cheer us on you'll have access to the same race day lift ticket rates we get ($35 - MSRP$49).   This is only available as a guest of Wedeln, so you must stay at the house Friday night to get the ticket.  Mostly because, darn it, we've got to be at the mountain by 8am so it will easier to get you hooked up if you're leaving the house with us and we know what you look like!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you're interested in this, please RSVP here and you must E-MAIL ME (membership@wedeln.com) by Tuesday February 26 at 9 PM!&lt;/b&gt; Please include your full name, your actual e-mail address and a cell phone number and someone will get back to you on how to get to the house.  Please note the house is $20 for the night and its dorm/hostel style accommodations - i.e. bring your own twin bed bunkbed type sheets, blankets, pillow etc.  (simpler - sleeping bag!)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are really into it, come up early as there is a Ski Race clinic on Friday, February 29th from 10 AM - 2 PM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can come make it!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to e-mail me with questions!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,  &lt;br /&gt;Jonathan  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;membership@wedeln.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come to the Blizzard Lounge on the 2nd Floor of Shawnee Peak Mountain between 8:00AM and 9:30AM.
