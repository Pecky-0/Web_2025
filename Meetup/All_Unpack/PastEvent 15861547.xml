&lt;p&gt;Mama Kicks, one of our faves is playing and Eva wants to&amp;nbsp;boogie here and on this date, for her birthday, as it looks like we're going to have nasty weather for the event we planned on Sat. Feb.&amp;nbsp;5th.&amp;nbsp; We've&amp;nbsp;been to this Sports Bar/restaurant before and it has a very huge dance floor with an excellent menu, the service is good and I think you will enjoy yourselves. We are a great group that have fun no matter where we go. T.P.s Scoreboard is right off&amp;nbsp;the highway, near the Holiday Select.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All This Girl Wants Is Another Reason to Party All Night Long..:-}&lt;/p&gt;
