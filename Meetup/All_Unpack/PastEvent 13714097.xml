<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>June 12, 2010 - Worldwide BP Protest Day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since April 20th, 210,000 gallons of oil a day spill into the Gulf of Mexico threatening fisheries, wildlife and attractions like the sandy white beaches.&lt;br /&gt;It is the result of a fiery explosion of BP’s oil platform 42 miles off the Louisiana coast which has left 11 crewmembers missing and presumed dead. Since then BP has been unable to stop the oil spill. The oil has reached wide coastal regions of the USA and has caused the death of an unknown number of birds, turtles, dolphins and other wildlife. It is predicted that the oil will reach the coast of North Carolina within the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This is the biggest oil catastrophe in history. It supersedes by far the Exxon oil spill of 1989 from which nature is still recovering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the internet platform Facebook, hundreds of thousands of concerned members have expressed their outrage about BP's inability to repair the leak and the company’s misleading PR statements. This platform has given people the chance to organize the initiative: Worldwide BP Protest Day – June 12, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local protests will be hosted by starters in 24 places on 5 continents. The motto “Think Global – Act Local” reflects the idea that environmental disasters do not stop at a nation’s border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worldwide protest sites include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atlanta, USA | Austin, USA I Berlin, Germany | Boston, USA | Charlottetown, Canada I Christchurch, Neuseeland | Cocoa, USA | Dallas, USA | Daytona Beach, USA I Gulf Breeze, USA | Houston, USA | Johannesburg, South Africa | Orlando, USA I Panama City, Panama I Santa Cruz, USA | Sao Paulo, Brazil | West Palm Beach, USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exercise your right to organize and protest against BP's irresponsibility and spread awareness about our dependence on oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BP Protest in BOSTON MA&lt;br /&gt;Start: June 12, at 12:00PM&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Point: THE STATE HOUSE, 24 BEACON STREET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ONLY RSVP AS &amp;quot;ATTENDING&amp;quot; IF YOU WILL PHYSICALLY BE THERE IN BOSTON.
