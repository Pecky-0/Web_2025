This year we have an especially exciting speaker to bring to you  --  naturalist, author, documentary scriptwriter, and radio commentator Sy Montgomery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her many award-winning books for children and adults, Sy Montgomery may take readers into the world of exotic wildlife in the far corners of the globe, or into the extraordinary lives of her rescued pig and hens.  Whether her subjects are the pink dolphins of the Amazon, snow leopards of Mongolia, tree kangaroos of New Guinea, tigers of Sundarbans, or the rescued pig and chickens who have shared her daily life, Sy views animals with respect, love, awe, and fascination with their individuality, and wants to inspire readers with the same.  Sy has been a vegetarian for over 30 years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called by the Boston Globe &amp;quot;part Indiana Jones, and part Emily Dickinson,&amp;quot; Sy Montgomery is dedicated to reaching as wide an audience as possible at this critical turning point in human history.  &amp;quot;We are on the cusp of either destroying this sweet, green Earth or revolutionizing the way we understand the rest of animate creation,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It's an important time to be writing about the connections we share with our fellow creatures. It's a great time to be alive.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are arranging to have at least three of Sy's books available for sale and signing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  the fun and heart-warming national bestseller The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.authorwire.com/s/good_good_pig.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.authorwire...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  the newly-released Birdology: Adventures with a Pack of Hens, a Peck of Pigeons, Cantankerous Crows, Fierce Falcons, Hip Hop Parrots, Baby Hummingbirds, and One Murderously Big Living Dinosaur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.authorwire.com/s/birdology.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.authorwire...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* her new children’s book, Kakapo Rescue: Saving The World’s Strangest Parrot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.authorwire.com/s/kakapo_rescue.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.authorwire...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* We will try to have some other titles from her amazing list of writings for children and adults:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.authorwire.com/s/s_biblio.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.authorwire...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BVS' annual event at the PEACE ABBEY in Sherborn is a highlight event of our year.
