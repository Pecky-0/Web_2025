Here are the details of the September meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a reminder: we start the meeting at 6:30 for those new to NLP, those who want a review, and those who want to come early to socialize/network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 7pm we will get rolling with the main event for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main event: Using Anchors in NLP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anchoring is one of the fundamental toolsets within NLP, and typically the one which is taught first in practitioner trainings.  It takes the idea of stimulus-response (as demonstrated with Pavlov’s dog), and uses it to “anchor” useful internal resources (for example, energy, humor, curiosity, compassion) that we can then use whenever and wherever we need them.  While anchoring is a fairly simple concept, techniques based on anchoring can be enormously powerful: for example, much of Tony Robbins’ work is based on anchoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will discuss how to set, trigger, and “steal” anchors, and then we will practice one or more NLP techniques, such as Circle of Excellence, that use anchors as their underlying mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to work on specific issues you are having that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;We meet on the first floor of Sturtevant Hall, 197 Herrick Road, which is near the library on the central quad of Andover Newton. &lt;br /&gt;Andover Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
