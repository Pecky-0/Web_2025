As a bonus, the lead developer was also present, and provided some great insight into the project. We also spent a good portion of the meeting sharing both DNN design and development knowledge, so everyone attending came away with some great tips/tricks that many of us have learned the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next meeting is this coming Monday (1st Monday of every month!), and will include another knowledge share - including the design and development of multilingual sites, DNN resources, customization or replacement of the text editor, and skinning tips and techniques for both designers and developers, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come prepared to share any tips / tricks that you have found useful in working with DNN!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Swanzey</member_name><member_id>2473211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263572813000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>DotNetNuke Users</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DNNBoston</urlname><id>1372592</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>DotNetNuke Boston Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236277751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DNN Boston monthly meeting</name><id>9888873</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239057000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DNNBoston/events/9888873/</event_url></item>
