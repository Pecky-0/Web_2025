<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>After a magnificent night at Sleep No More, a group of us came to the conclusion that we must attend again, but not before a viewing of Macbeth (so we know what's going on next time)!  Thus, the long-awaited viewing.  We are hoping to get Roman Polanski's Macbeth (1971), but may have to settle for the BBC's Macbeth (starring Ian McKellan and Judy Dench, so it can't be that bad).  If anyone has the Polanski version on DVD, it could earn you an easy rise to the Yes list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be viewing at Amy's house, so sign-ups are Waiting List only.  All RSVPs must be personally approved by either Amy or me, at which time you will be moved up to the Yes list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy lives in Belmont, where there is plenty of street parking and easy access on the 73 bus from Harvard Square. I'll e-mail out directions to her house to people on the Yes list the day before.  She has a big screen TV, which will make our Macbeth experience an awesome one.  Bring drinks and anything else you'd like to share (but not food, no food, please, please, no food), including tales of your Sleep No More experience!  One of the best parts of Sleep No More has been listening to what others saw or experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things to know:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Amy has two young cats (take note if you are allergic) &lt;br /&gt;- Amy has a few chairs but it's likely some people will be sitting on the floor (where she has a bunch of pillows)&lt;br /&gt;- Amy is the coolest chick ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions, please leave them in the comments section so everyone can see our responses.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Megan</member_name><member_id>10021028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1259360009000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258468854000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre/Post Sleep No More Viewing of Macbeth</name><id>11894414</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258930800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11894414/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/c/2/global_11866034.jpeg</photo_url></item>
