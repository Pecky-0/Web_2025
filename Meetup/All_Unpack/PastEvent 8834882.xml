<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For the October meetup we'll cover what happened at the &lt;b&gt;Plone Conference&lt;/b&gt; and brainstorm ideas to &lt;b&gt;promote World Plone Day&lt;/b&gt;. Bring any Plone questions you have and we'll try to answer them as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plone 2008 Conference in Washington DC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had three Boston Plone Meetup members (Nate Aune, Sally Kleinfeldt, and Aaron VanDerlip) that presented, and over the next few meetups they'll share their presentations. For those of you curious about any of the presentations that were given at DC, here's a link to the conference agenda: &lt;a href="http://plone.org/events/conferences/2008-washington-dc/agenda" target="_blank"&gt;http://plone.org/even...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, Aaron will cover his presentation about various add-on calendaring components for Plone: &amp;quot;Getting Dates with Plone: Connecting People with Events.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;World Plone Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://plone.org/events/wpd" target="_blank"&gt;World Plone Day&lt;/a&gt; is next month on November 7th and we'd like to spend some time planning an event here in Boston. We could have some talks in the morning geared towards newcomers to Plone and do some more advanced talks in the afternoon. If you have any talk ideas, please let me know and we'll discuss it at the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could also get folks from NGOs (Oxfam), education (Harvard), business and government (Newport News, City of Lowell) to come talk about how they are using Plone and then invite folks from those different sectors to come hear these talks about how Plone can help their organization or business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/28zbf6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/28zbf6" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/28...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [googlemap] &lt;br /&gt;The Betahouse entrance is the first door in the brick building and is just a couple blocks west of Mass Ave in Central Square, Cambridge, MA.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sid Koul</member_name><member_id>2310802</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mick Darling</member_name><member_id>3255622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226084537000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222387915000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone October Meetup</name><id>8834882</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224802800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/8834882/</event_url></item>
