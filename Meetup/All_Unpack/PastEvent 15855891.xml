We will be playing some popular games such as: pin the tail on the donkey, musical chairs, and other fun games.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have a potluck dinner as well as large birthday cake!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come celebrate the new year with me!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the event we will go dancing at the Rochester Opera House which is in Rochester City Hall--just down the street from the Governors Inn at 31 Wakefield Street.  The band is called Gazpacho and they will be playing music from the 80's, good dance music!  Tickets are $12--there are still tickets left, but it's possible it could sell out--so it's probably a good idea to get your tickets in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come out and have some fun! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some more info on the band: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;GAZPACHO&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    Presented by Rochester Child Care Center &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80's Dance Party   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gazpacho is a popular 80's cover band that has been together for over ten years. The band is comprised of music teachers, music store owners, touring musicians and session players. Outside of Gazpacho, band members have been featured on world tours, national label album releases and even MTV. The result is a total 80's experience with a band able to cover all the musical genres of the 1980's. From Classic Rock hits to New Wave electronica, Top 40 Radio Pop to Hair Metal excess and everything in between, Gazpacho guarantees a spot-on performance that will leave the audience asking for more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The money raised from ticket sales will go toward a new natural play scape for the center as well as new child enriching equipment for the playground. Advanced tickets are available at the Rochester Child Care Center located at 95 Charles Street in Rochester or contact the center by phone at (603) 332-9333. Tickets are also available at the Governor's Inn front desk, the Rochester Opera House box office or Ralph's House of Tone in Dover, NH.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cash bar available, patrons under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gazpachoonline.com &lt;br /&gt;rochesterchildcare.org &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294673781000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293680279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Peter's Birthday Party / Dance</name><id>15855891</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294441200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15855891/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/a/global_20502938.jpeg</photo_url></item>
