Here are the details of the July meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a reminder: we start the meeting at 6:30 for those new to NLP, those who want a review, and those who want to come early to socialize/network. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 7pm we will get rolling with the main event for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main event: Changing Beliefs with NLP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry Ford once said &amp;quot;Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't, you're right&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beliefs lie at the core of how we perceive, filter, and make sense of the world around us.  They can limit what we can achieve, or they can provide the ?internal scaffolding? for us to achieve extraordinary successes in life.  Changing a single important belief can have a profound effect on your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will learn and practice NLP techniques for changing beliefs.  These are techniques which you can use individually, to change your own limiting beliefs, or with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular.  I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to work on specific issues you are having that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;We meet on the first floor of Sturtevant Hall, 197 Herrick Road, which is near the library on the central quad of Andover Newton.&lt;br /&gt;Andover Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
