We are an informal group of folks with a wide range of skills. If you are just starting to go beyond living room play, I think you'll have fun, but if you're an advanced player you'll also have a chance to have a little competition. People chat over the games and occasionally play open with a dictionary. Most games are two player, but you might find a three or four player game. Finally, we often have other word games, such as Bananagrams and Boggle after the Scrabble fun has finished. We've just gotten on a regular schedule of meeting every other Sunday at 12 in Davis Square, Somerville (on the MBTA Red Line). I think this schedule works well for everyone, but I'm open to other ideas. If any of this sounds like fun, this is the group for you! We welcome all new members to come check us out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.51</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1234886742000</created><lat>42.3800010681</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>256</id><urlkey>scrabble</urlkey><name>Scrabble</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>9821</id><urlkey>wordgaming</urlkey><name>Word Gaming</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10581</id><urlkey>social</urlkey><name>Social</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15992</id><urlkey>games</urlkey><name>Games</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17866</id><urlkey>meeting-new-people</urlkey><name>Meeting New People</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>19585</id><urlkey>board-games</urlkey><name>Board Games</name></topics_item></topics><name>Scrabble Enthusiasts of (Greater) Boston</name><id>1385528</id><members>442</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>9980941</member_id><name>Quinten</name></organizer><urlname>Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/d/e/600_7376798.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/d/e/highres_7376798.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>7376798</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/d/e/thumb_7376798.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Somerville</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston/</link><lon>-71.0999984741</lon></item>
