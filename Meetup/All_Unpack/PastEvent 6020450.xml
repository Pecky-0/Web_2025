<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm in the process of moving to West Hartford and can not attend.  No one has volunteered to act as the organizer for this event, so I suggest you try to find each other on the hill below the Capitol Building, just downhill from the small grove of 2-3 trees, rather than from among the many gathered immediately in front of the stage on the flat ground.  I suggest you email each other directly, or update your &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVP, to inform yourselves what you'll be wearing, etc. to make it easier to identify each other.  In case if questionable weather, check out the venue site yourselves to see if it's been cancelled or moved indoors.  I have very limited access to the internet while moving, so won't be able to update this posting.  Have fun! - Rob P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Brown Monday Night Jazz Series presented by Prudential Financial. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series will run on consecutive Mondays through August 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bushnell Park, Hartford, CT 06115&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 30, 2007 6 pm Jessie &amp;quot;Cheese&amp;quot; Hameen II / 7:30 pm Rufus Reid Quintet &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 6, 2007 6 pm Fred Simmons Quartet / 7:30 pm Barry Harris Quartet &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mondaynightjazz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Monday Night Jazz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once an Organizer is confirmed, this site will be updated as to how to locate him/her.
