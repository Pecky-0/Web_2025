I'm going to see Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black (Wet Hot American Summer, The State) at the Somerville Theater this Thursday november 29th at 7:30PM. Somverville Theater is located right off the Red Line at Davis Sq and there is also a good sized parking lot in Davis Sq if you are driving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking that we could have a meetup after the show at Johnny Ds which is right across the street from the theater for a drink or if anybody wants some food. Johnny Ds has good food and are especially known for their jazz brunch on Saturday and Sunday. It should be a great show and I hope that some other people from the group will be going and want to meetup. We'll meetup outside of Johnny Ds following the show. Give me a call when you are outside or if you have any questions or concerns. 701-331-0920 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Moeri</member_name><member_id>4913745</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542667000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196038682000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter - Thursday</name><id>6802240</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196382600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/6802240/</event_url></item>
