The practices are for dancers who have at least the basic knowledge of salsa and feel they have something to practice.  We'll look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE!  To help us run practices more efficiently and help you get the most out of them, please state a few ideas of what you'd like to work on in your RSVPs, or email one of the organizers to the left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The practice will be 1.5 hours!  6:30-8:00pm at the Dance Complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also be going dancing afterward (Havana Club) to put what we're practicing to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to join us there, whether you attend the practice or not. See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW ADDITION!  We'll be going out to Green St. Grill for a couple drinks after the practice, before going dancing!  We thought this would be a great way to get to know one another a little better off the dance floor! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your dance shoes, your smile, and some ideas of what you would like to work on! Music is always welcome too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The studio is easily accessible off the red line in Central Square by T.  Or, visit www.dancecomplex.org for directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana Masacote (manager)</member_name><member_id>2622923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159664196000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1158104393000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Salsa Meet-up Practice</name><id>5127014</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158964200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/5127014/</event_url></item>
