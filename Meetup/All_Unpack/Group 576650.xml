The moderator posts weekly where we are to meet and when. Typical plein air sites include fields, historic sites, lakes, ocean, saltmarsh, rivers, and hills, all accessible easily. All media (drawing, photography, pastels, oils, watercolor, etc.) are welcome as are all skill levels. Group size will be limited so to keep the outings informal, manageable, and friendly. Family members are welcome, although specific quiet rules apply. The culture of the group is supportive and non-critical. Membership is free and artists are under no obligation to attend outings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.82</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1184850544000</created><lat>42.4500007629</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>1368</id><urlkey>painter</urlkey><name>Painter</name></topics_item></topics><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name><id>576650</id><members>114</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>3007793</member_id><name>Michael Emerald, CFA</name></organizer><urlname>painter-84</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/b/600_12503659.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/b/highres_12503659.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>12503659</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/6/b/thumb_12503659.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Winchester</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/</link><lon>-71.1500015259</lon></item>
