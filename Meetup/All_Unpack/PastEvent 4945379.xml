So -- back to before -- 2 locations. Hopefully we'll get a nice day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doggie Day &lt;br /&gt;400 Tremont near the Arlington St. intersection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Common (meet near Boylston T stop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note in RSVP which location you'll be going to so I can cancel one if it's looking to have little or no attendance. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2067938</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1150210969000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Chihuahua Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>chihuahua-99</urlname><id>32412</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Chihuahua Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1148225521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chihuahua June Meetup</name><id>4945379</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1150038000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chihuahua-99/events/4945379/</event_url></item>
