&lt;p&gt;All the answers are in twos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Such &amp;amp; Such&lt;/strong&gt;, teams try to solve a set of five clues. All of the answers are things that go together. For example, “The two youngest Brady kids” (answer: Bobby and Cindy); coffee complements (answer: cream and sugar); and motto of The Three Musketeers (answer: All for one and one for all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To play, one team member reads five clues to his teammates, who then have 40 seconds to solve them. &lt;br /&gt;

 Teammates may pass but will not be allowed to return to the clue. When time runs out, the opposing team has the chance to steal any passed clues and any clues that were not answered before time ran out. The first team to reach 25 points wins. Such &amp;amp; Such is for four or more players who play in teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send out my house number the day before the event to those who have RSVPed 'Yes'.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nidal</member_name><member_id>8949503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341973735000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun Folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Games-Events</urlname><id>1435824</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Games &amp; Events Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340755120000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night: Such &amp; Such</name><id>70883542</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341876600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RI-Games-Events/events/70883542/</event_url></item>
