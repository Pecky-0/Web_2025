<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;In case just watching the marathon is not enough of a way to celebrate Marathon/Patriots/Tax Day (do your taxes!), come on over to a potluck brunch/pregame! My housemates and I live just 2 blocks from where TMIRCE will be watching the race, so feel free to bounce back and forth between eating/drinking/merriment, and race-watching merriment with your favorite running people. We will provide some as-yet-undetermined brunchy foods, exciting beverages, and sign-making materials, but feel free to bring any/all of the above, as well as friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starts at 9:30, wheelchairs will go by at 10:30, then the first runners a bit after 11:30. Hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alistair H</member_name><member_id>49017262</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366045663000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365602953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Marathon Monday Brunch/Pregame</name><id>113641242</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>12600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366032600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/113641242/</event_url></item>
