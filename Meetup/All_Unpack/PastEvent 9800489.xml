<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Thanks to Matt for the following tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The academy awards-nominated animation shorts are playing Friday, March 6th at the ICA. I scheduled a meetup in honor of tonight's Oscars. Several films in the list are computer generated digital 3D animations, which might interest some in our group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The popularity of these shows increase following the awards, but I don't know if they will sell out or not. Tickets are $9 ($7 for members, students, and seniors), and can be purchased online for $12 at &lt;a href="https://buy.icaboston.org/public/" target="_blank"&gt;https://buy.icaboston...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest purchasing tickets in advance and RSVP Yes *after* you have tickets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will contact those who rsvp yes about meeting in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236726399000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235358449000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Acadamey Nominated Short Animated Films @ the ICA</name><id>9800489</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236383100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/9800489/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
