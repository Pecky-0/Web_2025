<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>According to the forecast, we are expecting a beautiful day tomorrow! I reopen the event and hopefully all of you can make the trip to Lowell folk festival. Most likely the festival will draw a big crowd tomorrow, so far we have a total of 65 people sign up for this meetup event, I won't be able to look for ANYONE, so please come on time and look for me or &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/members/3847345/"&gt;Biagio&lt;/a&gt;, the organizer of Social Fun group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally send out a reminder along with my cell# for a small event, but this time I decide not to. I will be at Market Street Stage around 11:30 and wear a blue/white callaway cap like &lt;a href="http://singles.meetup.com/1169/members/3609570/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; until 12:30pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring the meetup schedule with you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in case you are late or have problem to locate the group. The festival map will be available on the event website and at the festival. If this is your first time attending meetup event, please arrive at Market Street Stage before 11:45am, so I will be able to introduce you to the other group members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, there is a big chance that we won't be able to sit together this time but will try our best to keep everyone stay close.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bring On The Music!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emilie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;==========================================&lt;br /&gt;Updates as of July 20th -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are total 60 Yes, 30 from Social fun, 19 from Beantown and Beyond Singles and 11 from Cambridge Single Parents.
