So many new members come from all over the world, stopping in to a Boston meetup. We have members who are very experienced in different aspects of the industry, and many who are beginners looking to find help from you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have fun, great networking time, and projects to get involved in. I look forward to seeing familar faces and new members at the next Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you give us your profile as you RSVP especially if you are an older member before the requirements for joining.
