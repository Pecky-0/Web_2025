<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your comments on the recent poll.&lt;br /&gt;The majority of comments are leaning towards Monday . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am choosing MONDAY also because i see all the predictions indicating winds at or above 10 mph for Sunday (as usual this may be lower ??) but i have seen too may of you struggle in this level of wind. I anticipate Monday to be less wind than this and a few degrees warmer also.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Labor Day: Sunny, with a high near 78. Calm wind becoming west between 5 and 8 mph.   THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more specific weather at our paddling area:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/launch/code.cgi?Submit=Go&amp;amp;sta=KIJD&amp;amp;state=CT" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.usairnet.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time is a bit earlier &lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:00 am&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (we are closer to this site compared to the ocean, i expect less traffic, but may have a lot of boaters thinking &amp;amp; doing the same thing, &amp;quot;start a bit earlier--then barbie-q a bit earlier so everyone can go home earlier&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to be there and unload at about 10:30 or so since i have a lot of stuff to get Laoded &amp;amp; unloaded..&lt;br /&gt;We cant wait around for an hour as i have in the past when everyone is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Yes im the last one since i help as many as i can get going (ie foot pegs.etc). But most of you know how to do this so only a few need help now ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the last event(s)-- i have one nice salad bowl in the found box, a plate and other stuff, please check the box for your things..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a lunch snack for some shoreline area stop along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your chairs, PotLuck food and your favourite beverage for the Barbie-q just 3 minutes drive away from the boat ramp. I will have the Grill and maybe the Pop Up Can-O-Pee, table also, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some Hut Doags and Portogeezer buns (i like them better than the Hut Doags) and im sure you may also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lake and slow river type environment, miles and time are Dependant on the group paddling speed, distance, and desires. When we had enough, its head back, load up, and Barbie-Q time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to start off by going downstream (under the tunnel) to the big lake area first then head up the river near the airport  that passes through Diana's Pool (Name i forgit) till we are bored with it, or reach a point of too shallow depth.&lt;br /&gt;On our return trip we hit a good lunch spot that we seen on the way that looks sandy or interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#######&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting There:&lt;br /&gt;Mansfield Hollow Boat Launch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For GPS use # 300 Bassetts Bridge Road Mansfield Center CT, (its close enough).&lt;br /&gt;mapquest or other, just compare the directions below to what you get, they should be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;From Hartford --- I - 84 East to---&amp;gt;  I-384 East toward Bolton, bear right onto rte 6 at the (44 - 6 split) and follow rte 6  toward Willimantic.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt; rte 6 and rte 66 will intersect at a light. Take a left on to rte 6.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Follow this section of highway to the second exit, take the exit and go straight (=rte 633 or S. Frontage Rd.) it is actually a parallel to rte 6 as a connector to rte 195, (and heads towards the Mall &amp;amp; food store, etc)&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Signs for UCONN should be there somewhere too.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the connector, take a left and Go North on rte 195 towards UCONN for about 2 miles then turn right at the onto Basset Bridge Rd,&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Go apx 1 mile on Bassetts Bridge Rd.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;You Will see a picknick area on left but go a bit further (apx 0.5 miles) to the boat ramp access before the Bassetts bridge on the left.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;The picknick area you passed is where will  go after the paddling is done.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;At the boat launch, i will park as close to the bridge tunnels as i can, so look for me in that area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;br /&gt;Kayaks available:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Paddle &amp;amp; Paddle Leash, Life Jacket with whistle is included with any of my yaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doughnation of  $ 20.00,  bucks for my kayaks reserved for this particular event.&lt;br /&gt;Its way less than what sport shops charge and the yaks &amp;amp; Paddles are top quality delivered and picked up at the site etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you are familiar with the yak you choose and can fit in them since i don't have any &amp;quot;Wide Butt&amp;quot; (greater than 17&amp;quot;~18&amp;quot; butts) yaks anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Don't laugh, its serious, some will not fit in a yak thats too small (ie the Greenlander Pro--maximum butt and hips width of 12 inches limit) of an opening and i will feel sad you cant go..etc..the other option is to maybe trade with someone, etc, if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;This has worked in the past very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only bring the yaks that are confirmed by a positive confirmed yes and by persons i have some idea to match a boat to a  paddle skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybee's obviously can't reserve any yaks &amp;amp; if ya reserve one and don't show up, ya won't ever get a second chance to again unless its some real good excuse. Sorry i don't like to leave un-attended yaks on the trailer. They could get stolen too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please if using my yaks avoid stepping on the floor of them to get in and out and NEVER DRIVE UP ON SHORE WITH THEM LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO A DRIVE IN MOVIE. (Kate has to repair all the damage you make to the fiberglass and Gel coatings by doing this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Novices in short wide cheap plastic boats do that kind of thing because they simply don't know any better or don't care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INFO ON THE FOLLOWING LINK: I will also show you the correct way &amp;amp; you will look like a intelligent seasoned pro to impress the others who don't know how.
