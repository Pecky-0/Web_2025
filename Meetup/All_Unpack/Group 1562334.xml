Our goal is to bring those wanting information on health, together with the providers of health information. Nutrition plays a part in our daily lives in a variety of ways throughout the year. Each month a different topic will be discussed, but there will always be time for questions and answers on nutrition basics. Make sure you bring a notebook and get ready to learn! Handouts will be given for most workshops to aid in the process of applying what you've learned. This group is guaranteed to be your favorite and packed with nutritional wisdom!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
