This Futures in Life Science program will bring together experts across a wide range of disciplines and functional areas within the life science industry, who will detail their roles and will provide a rich context for the audience to gain a clear understanding of the skills, aptitudes, competencies, and personalities that thrive in their particular functions. Attendance for this program is open to current graduate students and post doctoral fellows who are interested in careers in the life sciences industry. The program will be launched on January 26th and will be followed by six seminars focusing on specific areas.  The kick-off meeting will provide an overview of the program goals and the life science industry, as well as a high level overview of the six seminars that will follow including opportunities in those areas.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Lang</member_name><member_id>3926861</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296085483000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Scientific Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nexusproject</urlname><id>1294865</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Nexus Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295885924000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Futures in Life Sciences Program - Overview of Life Sciences Career Paths</name><id>16164714</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296081000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nexusproject/events/16164714/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/c/global_12600668.jpeg</photo_url></item>
