Let's kick up the pace to around 16 mph&lt;/span&gt; (we usually average around 11-12).  If you'd like to go slower, that's fine, but I'm going to try to keep up the pace.  After all, we'll need to burn off all of that Halloween candy, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll tentatively meet this Sunday at 11:00AM on a trip from Providence on the East Bay Bikepath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;WE WILL BE STARTING ON THE PROVIDENCE SIDE&lt;/span&gt; at the parking lot near the Vets Memorial at Scenic Overlook just north of the address listed.  &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Vets+Memorial+at+Scenic+Overlook+%4041.813350,-71.387860&amp;amp;daddr=100+Veterans+memorial+pkwy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FWYFfgIdLLW--w%3BFdL-fQIdALe--ykt6tkLTEXkiTE4H-9hSOZVzQ&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;sll=41.812511,-71.387588&amp;amp;sspn=0.003035,0.002934&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a Map of the location&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a bike path ride - there are only a few places where we cross streets, so it's very safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The East Bay bike path is 14.5 miles of paved bike path from Providence to Bristol.  It's pretty flat except for a hill or two at the Providence side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE&lt;/b&gt; remember to take my cell phone number: 401-699-7304 in case you can't find us.  As usual, I will be sporting my signature red road bike.  I drive a red car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: This is a tentative event!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red bike, also I have a cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288650771000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288180541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tentative: Biking East Bay (FASTER pace)</name><id>15245167</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288537200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/15245167/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/5/a/global_19114954.jpeg</photo_url></item>
