Please join me as we hike 8.5 miles with a 150 foot elevation change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the abundance of hardwood trees, this trail will be quite colorful in the fall. Weâ€™ll follow the Vin Gormley Trail entering the Kimball Wildlife Refuge, Burlingame Camping Area and an Audubon Society sanctuary.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RI State law requires hikers to wear fluorescent orange hats or vests from October through the end of February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Providence:  Head south on Highway 95 to Route 4 South to Route 1 South to Charlestown. Continue driving south following signs for Burlingame State Park. Turn right (North) on Prosser Trail and go 0.6 miles to the park entrance on the left.  Park at the extreme left end of the parking lot. About 41 miles from Providence.   There is a $2.00 parking fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead:  Picnic area on the east shore of Watchaug Pond off Prosser Trail road.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nancy</member_name><member_id>5560956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256653038000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255874520000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Watchaug Pond Perimeter, Burlingame State Park</name><id>11652861</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256479200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/11652861/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/c/global_5586652.jpeg</photo_url></item>
