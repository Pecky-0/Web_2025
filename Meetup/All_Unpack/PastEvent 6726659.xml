If you went to Tarkovsky's &amp;quot;Nostalghia&amp;quot;on Saturday,  you heard him speak before and after the film.  You'd never know it from most of the mass media, but we Americans have a history and even sometimes a progressive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the description from the MFA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New England Film Artists Present&lt;br /&gt;Film&lt;br /&gt;Profit Motive and the whispering wind&lt;br /&gt;6:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;Friday, November 30, 2007&lt;br /&gt;Remis Auditorium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filmed throughout the United States over a three-year period, Profit Motive and the whispering wind is an elegant, elegiac film that chronicles the history of America?s progressive movement through its cemeteries, plaques, and monuments?our symbolic and physical landscape. Wordless, but not without sound, the journey presents a wind of change that summons images to lend a voice to those who have disappeared from cultural memory. Working in the tradition of Straub-Huillet, Gianvito (The Mad Songs of Fernanda Hussein) crafts a beautiful tribute to those who fought for their beliefs.
