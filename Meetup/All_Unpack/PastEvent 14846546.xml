The dead become restless, and the thin veil between us and them grows ever so thin. Whatever can we do? Why, dress funny, run about after dark and eat candy, of course! But beware â€“ zombies, ghosts and goblins like treats and tricks, too. Better get yours before someone else takes it first, or steals it right out from under your nose. Come in costume and get a bonus! This high energy two hour sword fighting event is geared for ages 6 and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call us at 781-270-4800 to pre-register! $15/member, $20/nonmember. At the door: $20/member, $25/nonmember.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287769562000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285089888000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buddy Night: The Night Before November</name><id>14846546</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287183600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/14846546/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/e/global_6162670.jpeg</photo_url></item>
