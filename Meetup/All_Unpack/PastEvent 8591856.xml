Whiteface &amp;amp; Passaconaway... a two-fer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt Whiteface (4020') with it's rugged ledges and Mt Passaconaway (4043') are both on the AMC's list of NH 4000 footers, so here's a chance to summit both in one nice loop hike.Â &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will make our way up the Blueberry Ledges Trail to the summit of Whiteface and then take the Rollins Trail to Passaconaway, and complete our loop using Dicey's Mill Trail. Total Mileage 11.9 with 3800 feet of elevation gain. We will take breaks as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get out there and Enjoy the mountains &amp;amp; the weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because we will need to ascend the ledges which can be dangerous in bad weather this is a fair weather hike only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All hikers that have RSVP'd &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; will be notified of any changes or cancellations to this hike. Please be prepared with proper gear and knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Milton</member_name><member_id>4294409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219668992000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219336293000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Whiteface &amp; Passaconaway.. a two-fer !</name><id>8591856</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219495500000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/8591856/</event_url></item>
