The healers learn to draw upon the unconditional love of mother earth with the Divine Compassion, Understanding, Wisdom and Forgiveness of Source, and to direct this energy from their hearts into the person receiving the healing. During this evening of healing the participants will learn how they can co create their own healing, there will be an energy circle, powerful guided meditation and individual An-Ra Energy work by the certified An-Ra Healers. Donations accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is the 20th year that Dr. Bezmen has been doing these monthly healings for the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Judith and William will meet you at Pathways To Health</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>William Bezmen</member_name><member_id>8774813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276984083000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Holistic health &amp; Spiritualist</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Pathways-to-Health</urlname><id>1369837</id><group_lat>40.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-73.0100021362</group_lon><name>Pathways To Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276557191000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An-Ra Healing</name><id>13801109</id><headcount>37</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276903800000</time><rsvp_limit>45</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Pathways-to-Health/events/13801109/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/0/global_7118880.jpeg</photo_url></item>
