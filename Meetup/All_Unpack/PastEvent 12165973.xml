Along the corridors are interesting academic diagrams, pictures and photographs.  As an added bonus there is a free public observatory night held by the Astronomy Department.  If skies are clear we will spend a few minutes looking at the planets and stars through a telescope.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letâ€™s meet at the entrance of the Boston University Observatory.  It is in front of room 520 (the fifth floor) on 725 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston at 7:15.  We will still walk and meet at this location even if the observatory is closed due to cloudy skies.  There is a nice bench to wait for others and several really cool Astronomy images.  There is free parking along some of the side streets on the Brookline side of Commonwealth Avenue.  It is also on the B branch of the Green Line.    &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266625679000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Walkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Evening-Walkers</urlname><id>865474</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Evening Walkers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262062420000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Indoor Walk and Academic Adventure:  Boston University</name><id>12165973</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266452100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Evening-Walkers/events/12165973/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/5/global_12414549.jpeg</photo_url></item>
