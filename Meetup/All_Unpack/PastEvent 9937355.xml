I actually &amp;quot;manifested&amp;quot; this venue because I was looking for alternative easy, convenient and cheap ways to network (not just locally but nationwide) besides attending In-Person networking events.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, guess what dropped into my lap. A company with a new technology that's making it easy and effortless for folks to have 1-on-1 conversations over the phone. Cool, huh?&lt;br /&gt;(Even cooler is that it was a Boston LOA member, Deb Mullen, who mentioned BlitzTime to me.&lt;br /&gt;Extra WOW is to find out that one of the inspired creators of BlitzTime, Mike Sachleben, is a BostonLOA member.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and yes, I've met a lot of wonderful folks nationwide that I'm collaborating with (for various business-related and social activities).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Buck</member_name><member_id>2466801</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chew-Hoong</member_name><member_id>3101506</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239147504000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Law of Attraction Co-Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lawofattraction-us</urlname><id>368525</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236832775000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special Event:   LOA-BLITZ with Easy, Effortless Way of Networking</name><id>9937355</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236945600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lawofattraction-us/events/9937355/</event_url></item>
