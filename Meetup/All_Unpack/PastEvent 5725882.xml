Mother Clare is a dynamic speaker, down-to-earth, with great integrity and powerful insights. She is a modern-day mystic, Teacher, national speaker, author, parent, and former homebirth midwife and psychotherapist with Jungian training. She will be giving seminars of topics of inner spirituality on Thursday and Friday nights, and on Saturday morning. I am posting these events in addition to our regular meetups since they may be of interest to some group members. There is an admission fee for these seminars. See below for a description of this day's seminar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday,  May 12th  10am - 2pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healing Body, Mind, Heart, and Soul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have come to understand that their hearts, minds, bodies, and souls are all linked to each other. What affects your heart, mind, or soul will eventually affect your body as well. Our bodies will begin to show the results of hurt or angry thoughts or feelings that we hold for a long time. Our hearts and minds will also cause us problems if we don't find out what our underlying emotional wound is and ask someone who knows how, to help us heal it. Psychotherapy can help, but a spiritual approach is faster and more thorough in healing our whole selves. If you want to learn about healing anything in your heart, mind, body, or soul, this workshop is for you. There will be lecture time and also time for actually experiencing the application of healing energy according to your needs and desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Lunch is included.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
