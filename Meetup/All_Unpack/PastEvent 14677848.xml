We utilize private dance parties as a vehicle to meet other singles.  Purpose is to socialize with similar people of our age (30-65) who are searching for a lifetime partner.  Have fun meeting old and new friends.  Circulate, talk to everyone.  If someone is alone go up to them and say hi!  Please be Friendly, Positive, and optimistic to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Yes Dance - I ask you to be respectful and say yes to anyone who asks you to dance once.  Please understand this is our number one value.  If you are able to say yes, then this is a great event for you to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invite other friends, particularly men.  Our objective is to have an equal amount of men and women.
