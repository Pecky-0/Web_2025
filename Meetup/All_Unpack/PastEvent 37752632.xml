&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet spot:&lt;/strong&gt; Gate 41&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put 185 Park St, Clinton, MA, into Google Maps because I was able to get the dead-end of the road that way...but 185 is a house. Anyway, the yellow gate is right there, because there is a photo of it on Google Maps. Don't block the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map of gates and fire roads:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/watersupply/watershed/maphome.htm#Wachusett%20Reservoir"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/dcr/watersupply/watershed/maphome.htm#Wachusett%20Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll hike from near the Wachusett Dam west along the fire road to the North Dike. It's about 2.5 miles one-way, and it's all along the shoreline and over the Dike. It's not a loop, so we can walk as far as everyone wants and come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring something to drink and a lunch or snacks. We can eat on the dike. According to the weather yesterday, it should be nice (as it was today). Dress for comfortable and breezy weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No swimming, wading, or animals; it's a public water supply. Take your trash with you when you leave.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park Street dead-ends in front of a yellow gate (Gate 41). I drive a white Dodge Stratus.
