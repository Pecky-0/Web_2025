From the website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the intimate and rustic settings of California’s Sonoma Valley and the modern Gastropubs of Britain,&lt;br /&gt;Sonoma is the Gastropub of the North Shore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a Gastropub?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Gastropub is a British term for a Public House that specializes in high quality food, a step above the more basic “Pub Grub”. Gastropubs usually have an atmosphere that is a little more relaxed than traditional restaurants but more upscale than a traditional pub. The focus is to provide fine cuisine prepared as well as you would in the best restaurants. The phrase was coined in 1991 when David Eyer and Mike Belben opened a pub called the “Eagle” in London. They placed emphasis on the quality of food served and not just the traditional “Pub Grub&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building on this concept, in addition to offering upscale “Pub Grub” and rustic Flatbread Pizza, Sonoma also offers a diverse selection of gourmet cuisine prepared with traditional cooking styles from around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonomasalem.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Brits-Euros-Singles-group/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The $1 fee is to help cover organizer costs...you'll have to pay for your own dinner, of course! You can check out the menu and prices on the restaurant website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's a small place, should be easy!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258936966000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>North Shore Brits &amp; Euros</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Brits-Euros-Singles-group</urlname><id>1354184</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Brits &amp; Euros</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255399016000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday night at Sonoma - a Gastropub evening in Salem!</name><id>11613247</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258763400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Brits-Euros-Singles-group/events/11613247/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/9/global_6885433.jpeg</photo_url></item>
