De-stress with a nice evening walk with friends.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk with us through the quiet neighborhoods of Needham while admiring all the pretty holiday lights. We will meet at the Needham Center Train Station parking lot at 5:00 PM and walk for about  2 hours. The parking lot has ample free evening parking.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is interest, we can have dinner, or hot toddies, afterward at Not Your Average Joe's in Needham Center.  Let me know in your RSVP so that I can make arrangements.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell number is 781-956-2099 if you need to reach me before the walk. I live in a cell dead zone, so you can also try my home number 781-237-6719.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy rain or snow cancels.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joanna</member_name><member_id>4442725</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198620619000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197054695000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Needham Holiday Lights Stroll</name><id>6874115</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198447200000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6874115/</event_url></item>
