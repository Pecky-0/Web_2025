If you haven't seen it, you can watch it &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6532706479776208572" target="_blank"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;for free (critical thinking skills required).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your blank DVDs to the meeting and be sure to get a copy of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should have time for another video as well, so be sure to bring your favorites for us to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short subjects&lt;/b&gt; - bring what you think others should see - we'll see what shorts we have time to view. We also have the capability to show You Tube and Google videos, so bring your links.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: &lt;b&gt;1st Tuesday-Nashua&lt;/b&gt;; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord; 4th Tuesday- OPEN (our Bristol screenings will take place on another night). If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, we'll have a special organizing meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive by 7:00 PM&lt;/b&gt;, since this meeting is on a tight schedule. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and the video will begin promptly at 7:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring healthy snacks and/or drinks&lt;/b&gt; for sharing, since some may have come to our meeting directly from work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contributing a box of your favorite tea is always a good idea to build an inventory of available beverages!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking is in the lot in front of the building&lt;/b&gt;. Please enter the right entry doorway and suite 135 will be directly ahead of you. After entering the office, turn left to go to the video viewing room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balanced Health is moving at the end of the month and the new facility will not be ready for our group for our regularly-scheduled June meeting yet, so we are looking for another venue in Nashua for the June screening only. Please spread the word. We could possibly go back to the 603 Lounge for the June screening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newspaper&lt;/b&gt; - For an interesting paper which covers 9/11 Truth issues and other topics of concern, visit the &lt;a href="http://RockCreekFreePress.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rock Creek Free Press&lt;/a&gt; out of Washington, D.C. and see &lt;a href="http://9-11.meetup.com/307/pages/Newspapers_and_Journals/"&gt;our meetup page for others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have set up a &amp;quot;carpooling group&amp;quot; online&lt;/b&gt; at eRideShare.com.
