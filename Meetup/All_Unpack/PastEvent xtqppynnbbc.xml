Only &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; don't leave someone at the track alone after dark and check in so others know when you leave.  If you have a headlamp, feel free to wear it.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can keep this going as long as members want to meet and we don't have snow or ice on the track!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday and Wednesday nights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6:00pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School&lt;br /&gt;Track&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the entrance by the bleachers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer(s): Julie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by NOON &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.
