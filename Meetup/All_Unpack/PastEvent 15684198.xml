The repertoire is centered around masterpieces of Russian folklore and represents the diversity of the culture, ranging from gently humorous songs, to elaborate lyrical suites, to pulsating dance numbers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program is broad and varied, with something to appeal to everyone, including audience participation though clapping and learning Russian songs and words.  Lilting balalaikas, dynamic bayan accordion, unique trashotky and loshky, humorous dances, and superb vocals combine for an exhilarating and educational performance for audiences of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no admission charge.   They just ask for a donation for children in Russia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a second (shorter program) that same evening at the Community UMC, 5 Damon Street, Wayland  @7:00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.russianfolk.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Claudia</member_name><member_id>8411699</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294276747000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Russian Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>expatrussian-64</urlname><id>1112191</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Families with Russian Kids, Moms Club, Playgroups</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291861077000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Golden Gates</name><id>15684198</id><headcount>60</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293998400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/expatrussian-64/events/15684198/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/4/global_20126916.jpeg</photo_url></item>
