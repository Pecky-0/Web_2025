As totâ€™s mobility increases, classes offer tot-centric poses that encourage and support their physical explorations. Tots become more confident in their moving bodies as they practice yoga both in and out of class. &lt;br /&gt;During a Tots Itsy Bitsy Yoga class crawlers and walkers playfully practice yoga postures while they are standing, sitting up, walking, and jumping. Parents also get to do a little yoga, but no yoga experience is required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you for arranging just 1 parent/caregiver per family.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next Weekend Tots IBY Meetup Time:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;Saturday, April 11,  2:30-3:15pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cost: $15/class (pre-payment required w/ YES RSVP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Us:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All Weekend IBY Meetup classes are taught by Alexandra De Collibus, Certified Itsy Bitsy Yoga Facilitator and Director of Absolute Yoga in Hopkinton, MA.
