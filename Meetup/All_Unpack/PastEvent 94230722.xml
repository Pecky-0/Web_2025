We will start with tea ceremony practicing liquid meditation. At this time paper and pen will be given one piece to write down all that we want to surrender to the universe that does not serve our highest good and one piece to write down all that we want to manifest in our lives. We will have a talking circle to share in a sacred space. We will then move into simple Qi Gong energy exercises to open up the energy in our bodies. Next will will have a meditation with guided imagery using an alchemist shamanic journey. This will be accompanied by a combination of soothing music, drumming, singing bowls, vocal toning, crystals, and energy healing. This beautiful journey will help you access profound inner wisdom and integrate that knowledge to become more empowered and fulfilled in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
