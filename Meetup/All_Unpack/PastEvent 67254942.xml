 This will be a relatively long, brisk hike over varied terrain -- Our route will be to head up around Pine Acres Lake, head north briefly on the Airline Trail Greenway, take the Blue trail around Black Spruce Pond, then go back down the Airline Trail to our start point.  The hike takes about &lt;strong&gt;2- 2.5&lt;/strong&gt; hours but we'll stop and picnic in the middle, so plan on slightly longer. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 You'll want to wear hiking boots and bug spray, and bring water and your picnic in a daypack. While this is not a steep trail, it does have some rolling hills, rocky terrain, and mud, so proper footwear is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Dogs are welcome -please give a heads up if you plan to bring yours :) There is plenty of water for dogs on the trail. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
