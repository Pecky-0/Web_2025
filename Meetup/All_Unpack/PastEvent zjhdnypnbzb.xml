&lt;p&gt;The subject for our meeting this month will be &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;10 Steps to Setting Up a Successful Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; address screening methods, watchlists, or the selection of any particular asset or asset class&amp;hellip; the assumption being that you have already used IBD, CAN SLIM, or some other method of your choice to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it will &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; be directed toward the use of any specific technical indicators, entry set ups, or trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it will focus on the types of questions you should&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ask AND answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;for yourself prior to placing your trades in an effort to eliminate (or at least minimize) the effects of emotional interference once the trade has been opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each area of the discussion is intended to include elements you should incorporate into your Trading Rules and/or Trading Plan with the goal of developing yourself into a more consistently successful trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a book they'd care to recommend, or provide a review on for the group, please let me know via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, bringing questions regarding a favorite stock from your own watchlists (or perhaps even a trade from the past) for a group critique is very much encouraged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room). Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a &amp;#65279;&amp;#65279;lively and engaging discussion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile...&lt;/p&gt;
