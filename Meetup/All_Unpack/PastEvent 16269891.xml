Would anyone be interested in being a part of that? We could take turns choosing books and meet monthly (or some other increment) to discuss what we are reading. It might be a nice compliment to our Monday meetings but less oriented towards listening to or watching talks and more towards discussing what we think about the books we are reading. If there's enough interest I'd be happy to suggest a starting book, unless someone else has a fabulous book worth sharing!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310490174000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288626182000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>mindfulness book club</name><id>16269891</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310421600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/16269891/</event_url></item>
