&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metrorock is in Everett and is a very short drive from North Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will attempt to arrange car pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After climbing we can join for a meal and relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility has many climbing levels so do not be intimidated.  A larger group will allow for more pairing and swapping as people learn with their comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will figure out a meal place once we have a feel for where attendees are coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be fun as we have already tested it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Meetup fee but we need an accurate headcount in advance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356903007000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>40-plus</urlname><id>1222683</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2699966431</group_lon><name>40/50 Something Year Olds - Men &amp; Women Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356384500000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climb and dine starting at indoor rock climbing at Metrorock in Everett</name><id>96438392</id><headcount>3</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356879600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/40-plus/events/96438392/</event_url></item>
