&lt;p&gt;Mojitos Lounge  &lt;br /&gt;48 Winter Street  &lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02108&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginner Salsa Lessons 9pm - 10pm (No additional Cost)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Dancing 10pm - 2am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Guest List set up with the Owner and it'll be under "Meetup" and it will only be $5. The Guest List closes at 11pm, so if you come any time later, it will be the normal cover charge of $10. No exceptions unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress Code: No Athletic Attire (No baseball caps, jerseys, sneakers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music: Primarily Salsa and Latin Music with a little bit of Reggaetone / Top 40 / Hip Hop mixed in between. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Xiao Long will be at Mojito's Lounge at 9pm and most of us will be waiting upstairs, taking the Beginner's Lessons.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been here a good number of times and have always had fun, so hopefully all of you can join in on the fun!  :]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
