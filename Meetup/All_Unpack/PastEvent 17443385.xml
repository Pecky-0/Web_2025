We have done this event time and time again. But, everyone seems to  enjoy it each time. So, please bring the dogs, the kids and friends.  Join Steve O. and his friends for an easy hike through 170 acres, up  wooded trails.  This is Andreas' Sculpture Park with art work from  sculptor from around the world all along the trails. At the top of the  trail is a spot with seats and a view of Mt. Manadnock 75 miles away.   Where we can sit and have a picnic at the top of the trail. If you can  not make it at 11:00 am?  Than meet us at anytime along the trail. The  trail crisscrosses the main driveway to the top and the art studio. Do  not drive up the driveway. We park below at the start of the paved  driveway on the right. You can also just meet us for the picnic. Steve  O. will have his Ceil phone on to help find us. Dress for changing  weather and the woods, and remember the Deer Ticks are out. Bring your  own lunch and drink.   This is privet property. So, what we bring into  the park . We must bring out.
