The trail follows an old woods road, then suddenly leaves it R to descend and recross Stony Brook, this time with no bridge. The trail climbs to reach another woods road at .8 miles and turns L on it. (This is the former route of the trail, bypassed when a housing subdivision was built across it. In an emergency, continuing down the old route and asking a homeowner to call 911 may be the fastest way to get help.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail continues up this road which becomes steeper and fainter. At 2.3 miles, a brook is crossed on rocks and the trail ascends to the col between Mount Moriah and North Carter at 3.5 miles, where it ends at the Carter-Moriah Trail. The junction with the Moriah Brook Trail is just to the L. The summit of Mount Moriah is 1.5 miles to the L on the Carter-Moriah Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.mountainsummits.com/pictures/newhampshire/moriah/moriah.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stony Brook Trailhead: NH Route 16 about 1.8 miles S of US Route 2 in Gorham, elevation about 934 feet&lt;br /&gt;44.3635°N, 71.1769°W (WGS84)&lt;br /&gt;WMNF fee site $3.00 or annual pass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 YES RSVP'S ARE NEEDED TO CREATE A MEETUP.
