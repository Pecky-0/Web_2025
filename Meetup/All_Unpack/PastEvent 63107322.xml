&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;Showtime is at 7:30.Â  I will be at the theater by 6:30 and the group will head in for seats by 7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;The movie is showing upstairs, so the group will gather at the tables by the window at the top of the escalator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This will definitely sell out BUY YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after. We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after and bring $$$$.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
