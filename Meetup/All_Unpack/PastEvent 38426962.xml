<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I don't have anything specific in mind here yet, but I wonder if anyone else is ever interested in Friday night or Saturday meetups. I find a lot of meetup groups (and the South Shore Graphic Design meetup in particular) meet on weeknights and this is often difficult with work! If this sounds like something that might work for you all, I'd love to help organize a meetup!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332617316000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Graphic Designers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>graphicdesign-39</urlname><id>71144</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Graphic Design Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319404140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potential weekend meetup?</name><id>38426962</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332612000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/graphicdesign-39/events/38426962/</event_url></item>
