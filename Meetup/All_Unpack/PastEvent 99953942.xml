Ever! They've been producing records together for over twelve years now, and their latest "Centipede Hz," is AMAZING! They make the most unique, complex and enchanting music out there today. Seriously, their music from ten years ago would still blow your mind if it came out today. This is the kind of band people catch on to years after they're done playing music.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're new to their music I would recommend starting with their albums "Merriwether Post Pavilion" and "Centipede Hz." For individual songs, "In The Flowers," "What Would I Want? Sky," "Bluish," "The Purple Bottle," "Moonjock," and "For Reverend Green/Fireworks" all show off different aspects of their sound. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening act, Dan Deacon, actually played at Paradise in November and his show was so much fun! His music is incredible and he really has fun with live shows, interacting a lot with the crowd in a creative way. He played mostly from his album "Bromst" which has turned into one of my personal favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doors at 7pm, and show starts at 8pm, so we'll meet at The Lansdowne at 6:30 and head over to the venue at 7:30. Can't wait to geek out and enjoy the show with everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA tickets have sold on HoB's website, though there are still some stadium seats left if you don't mind getting one of those. If you're willing to pay extra for GA there's quite a few on StubHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom L</member_name><member_id>8705140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362710350000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1358375946000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Animal Collective!</name><id>99953942</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362699000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/99953942/</event_url></item>
