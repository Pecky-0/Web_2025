&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a description of the film.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Kim, a 29-year old advertising executive (Brian Tee from THE FAST AND FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT), feels the pressure from his parents and other relatives to wed before his 30th birthday in order to avoid an ancient curse placed on his family. A visit from a Shaman, played by Margaret Cho, reminds Jason and his family that if he is not married before his 30th birthday, he will certainly die a horrible death. On a business trip in Seoul, Jason falls for businesswoman Na-Young, played by popular Korean star Hye-jung Kang (OLDBOY, WELCOME TO DONGMAKGOL). News of their budding online relationship gives Jason’s family hope, until the young bride to be touches down at LAX and she is not what Jason’s family, or for that matter, Jason himself, expected… In this day of virtual dating, are webcam sessions and phone calls enough to really know someone? Are Na Young and Jason the perfect match? Sit back and enjoy the ride in this rollicking family comedy where finding true love could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance of happiness, or a sure path to regret. - Vera Devera, LAAPFF&lt;/p&gt;
