Former lover, friends now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former friends, now lovers? Lovers every so often? Relationship with more than 1 person? Dating a number of people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On again, off again? Friends with benefits? Secret or private relationship? Open relationship?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how to define it? Limited physical connection? Intimate relationship but no physical relationship? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In constant pursuit, but no real relationship? Once a week relationship? Long distance relationship? Remeeting after 10 or 20 years? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an evening to explore options, share your experience with confidentiality, and look at creative ways to make your experience more satisfying or make more sense out of what's happening! At the least you'll experience being accepted and more understood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sliding scale from $20-40. Pay the best you can even if you can't pay $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. Ok to bring vegetarian additional or drinks if you want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** About Herb Pearce *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce is a relationship coach of 30 years for couples, singles and families.
