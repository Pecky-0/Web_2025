We like to take the opportunity once a year to share what Humanism is and what it means to us as individuals and as a group.  You are welcome to arrive and mingle around 6:30 PM.  We will begin the formal meeting at 7 PM with an overview of the past years events and speakers.  As always this and most of our events are open to the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the overview we will elect new members to the Steering Committee.  All paid members in good standing may vote. Any member interested in being on the Steering Committee must submit a statement, no more than 75 words, explaining their qualifications, background in humanism, and goals and vision for GWH if elected to the Steering Committee. These statements must be sent to Chris Moran through the CONTACT button on the GWH website by August 15 in order for candidates to be nominated by the incumbent Steering Committee. The term in office is two years.  There are currently three open seats on the committee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the election we will have our small group discussion, each headed by two members of our Steering and Outreach Committees.  The committee members will head off discussions at each table by relating their individual &amp;quot;path to Humanism,&amp;quot; and then invite individuals to share their experiences.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284079960000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281309174000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paths to Humanism 2010</name><id>14360116</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283900400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/14360116/</event_url></item>
