She is an amazing woman and we are truly blessed to be able to hear her speak.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LYNN'S BIO   &lt;br /&gt;Former Tennis Professional, Lynn Krokenberger's dream was to help others with their health. She laid her cornerstone by focusing her energy and attention in the field of nursing and completed her RN. She then completed her studies in Homeopathic Medicine (CCH) and spent twelve years at the Health Integeration Centre with Dr Van Beveren, PhD, as a Homeopath, kitchen chemist, raw food educator and collaborator with Dr Van, lecturing and educating on Sunrider's Philosophy of Regeneration. Lynn has helped hundreds of people achieve peak health through live enzyme therapy, raw food and positive encouragement!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She with the help of our own Tom Lindsley will be teaching about the importance of hydration; what is food; how the body prioritizes food; how the food gets nutrition from the soil; what the soil and the body have in common (micro-organisms)... and much more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vortex elixirs will be flowing!  I have had so many people from the last meetup asking about the amazing elixir.  Some of the responses I got were....I had so much energy, I slept better than I have in a long time, Are you sure there was no alcohol in there?!  The biggest question was....how do I get this stuff?!  It is amazing how alive you can feel when your body is nourished!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a raw vegan organic dish enough for 6-8 people.  If you are new and not sure what to bring a salad (fruit or veggie) is always good!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on Friday!  Adults $2 Kids always free!  &lt;br /&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275926492000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275175110000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup June 4!</name><id>13635438</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275690600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/13635438/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/b/global_9355803.jpeg</photo_url></item>
