&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking forward, backward and sideways on his characters' lives, Alan Ayckbourn's latest play,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Life of Riley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is a wry look at life, death and love. George Riley's closest friends have just discovered that he only has a few months to live, and that causes them to reflect and interpret the shocking news in their own way, with his final farewell affecting all of their futures. Ayckbourn is one of the world greatest living playwrights, and this is his 74th work, and the fourth which Zeitgeist has produced in the last four years. Don't miss this touching comic look at mortality and friendship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
