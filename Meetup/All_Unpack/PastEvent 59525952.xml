&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;Buckland Hills Mall Sign Wave and lit. Distribution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it... The last weekend before CT's Primary, and we need everyone to come out (even if you've been MIA) with their signs, brochures and enthusiasm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our go-to spot in 2007/8 and was popular in 2011/12 as well; we've had more Ron Paul sign waves here than any other location. And this will likely be the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAST RON PAUL SIGN WAVE at this location EVER HELD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Let's make it a HUGE turnout people!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting place is in the commuter lot that's behind the old John Harvard's restaurant (now the Tullycross Tavern) and the Mobil station (with the Dunkin' Donuts in it). The wave itself will be at the intersection of Buckland Hills Drive and Buckland Street, just a short walk from the lot. It's scheduled for 11am to 3pm but they often run longer, please call 860-730-3RON if you need help finding our location andor status the day of the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335116777000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333730076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buckland Hills Mall Sign Wave and lit.
