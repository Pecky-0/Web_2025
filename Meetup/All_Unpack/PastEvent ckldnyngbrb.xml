People don't want to give too much of it away.  What we have gathered, however, is that this is a great book club discussion book because each person will interpret the events in the story differently and come to their own conclusions.  We also hear that it may be a bit controversial, and a good debate never hurt any book club.  I hope you enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask the bartender or hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>7202411</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Craig</member_name><member_id>8977543</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271373414000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portsmouth-Book-Club</urlname><id>1147811</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268183555000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portsmouth Book Club April Meetup - Little Bee</name><id>ckldnyngbrb</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271199600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portsmouth-Book-Club/events/12834019/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/7/global_13568087.jpeg</photo_url></item>
