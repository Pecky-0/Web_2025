I am scheduling a game for Sunday afternoon in hopes enough people will sign up for us to play.  8 people need to sign up as DEFINITES in order for the game to happen.  I would love to have 10 people though!  We can all go out for some drink/apps after the game if anyone is interested in doing so.  Please only respond YES if you are a DEFINITE YES!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lori&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for the net</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284995963000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284653405000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beach Volleyball- Sunday!</name><id>14792221</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284926400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/14792221/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/c/global_2393356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
