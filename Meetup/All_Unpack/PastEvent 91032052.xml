&lt;p&gt;The cost is $85 for four classes, regardless of attendance, or $35 a class.  You are free to stay with the gathering as long as you like (we currently have people who have been studying for over 5 years) and you are free to leave when you feel you are no longer benefitting.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you are interested or if you have any questions before you decide to RSVP, as advance payment is required.   If you pay the $35 and decide to stay for the next three gatherings, you can simply pay the balance of $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  Once you choose a Tuesday or Wednesday gathering, you cannot switch after the first six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>come in at the upper porch level</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357754402000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352722882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living in Your Heart Gathering</name><id>91032052</id><duration>7200000</duration><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357745400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/91032052/</event_url></item>
