<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm hosting another game day at my house in Concord, NH, starting at noon and running until 8 pm or so. My goal, as always, is to push a few unplayed titles onto the table â€“ a goal that has been thwarted again and again. I'm likely to have a few new titles from Japan that will absolutely need attention so that I can cover them on my website prior to a big game convention in October. Come by, and help me test these new games!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP with an arrival time if you're in, and feel free to suggest games that you want to play, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the host of the house</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256172682000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253384554000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>11414087</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253980800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/11414087/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
