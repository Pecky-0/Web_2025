The warm weather has been perfect for growing corn, and the stalks will be towering well above your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This season's design honors the two year achievement of the UCONN Women's Baskeball Team!&lt;br /&gt;78 Wins!&lt;br /&gt;0 Defeats!&lt;br /&gt;2 National Championships!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UCONN Women's Baskeball Team has certainly put Connecticut on the map in the collegiate baskeball world! It was only fitting that a tribute has been maped out for them the cornfield!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have followed the UCONN Women's remarkable basketball journey over recent years, you'll love following the pathways through the 'corny' tribute to their a-MAZE-ing success. Even non-sports fans will find much to celebrate during maze season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So c'mon out and attempt the maze. There are &amp;quot;corn cops&amp;quot; out there if you get lost...so don't fear! Enjoy the crisp autumn air...have a cup of cider.
