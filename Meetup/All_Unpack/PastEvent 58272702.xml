While I was hoping to have access to the Ron Paul campaign's CT lists it appears that won't be happening. Our alternatives are to pay for lists or get them via our Town Halls (residents are allowed access to lists in their own towns). For the time being I've went with the latter option, and I don't want to let another weekend slip by without a meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have walking lists ready, along with issue slim jims and super brochures. We can meet at Nature's Grocer in Vernon (a great local business, it's like a mini Whole Foods) to start and break into teams if we get enough of a turnout. They have some tables and serve food as well, we can grab a bite to eat before we leave or even meet back up a little later for a lunch break. It's looking like we'll have a high of 53 degrees but the weather should be good overall for us. Dress warm and bring comfortable shoes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333399 ; font-size : small"&gt;Located in Northeast Plaza at the junction of Routes 30 &amp;amp; 31. Take I- 84E to Exit 67 and take left, then a right at the first intersection, and then a left into the plaza. From the north take 84 west to exit 67. Take right then a right at the first intersection and a left into our parking lot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've scheduled this for 11am, and I anticipate it going no later than 6pm. If you can only make the morning, please still come out. Likewise, it you want to join us in the afternoon please feel free to. You can give &lt;strong&gt;860-730-3RON&lt;/strong&gt; a ring and we'll get you our exact location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we spread the word about Ron Paul and Liberty - the media isn't going to do it, and unfortunately not enough will voluntarily seek the information out online; &lt;em&gt;we have to bring it to them&lt;/em&gt;. Just ONE slim jim in the right hands might change someone's life if it awakens them to political reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333211664000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332968560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canvassing for Ron Paul in Vernon</name><id>58272702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333206000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/58272702/</event_url></item>
