Come to Limelight Studios this Friday night, where you can choose to sing or watch others express themselves, while meeting new and interesting people.  We will have our own private room, TV and karaoke system filled with tons of songs to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Space is limited, so please RSVP right away to reserve your spot.  The regular cost for this event is $15, but if you RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; by Thursday, the cost is only $10.  And if you RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;, please show up!  Due to space considerations and our reserved room, I need to keep an accurate RSVP count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether you are experienced karaoke singer or someone trying for the first time, all are welcome to join the fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PLAN:  Meet at 9pm sharp at Limelight Studios (204 Tremont St, near Boylston St) and tell the doorman you are under the Boston Nightlife Meetup reservation.  Please be on-time, as our room is reserved for two hours, from 9pm to 11pm.   Please bring cash to pay for the cost of this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER:  My picture is on the left-hand side of the web site, and my phone number is 646.541.0708.
