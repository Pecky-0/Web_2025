The house will be open for any person or pug who feels a chill.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;               ******************************************&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the November meetup, it's back to Buford's in Carver.  This should be a real party, since all three of the Buford, Millie, Max clan are celebrating birthdays in November, and we have been promised liver cupcakes!  Clovis is thrilled!  We hope to see all of our Puggie friends there, along with their owners, so that we can raise a rousing chorus of Happy Birthday to all our birthday Pugs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST MONTH'S MEETUP...&lt;br /&gt;The October Meetup and First Halloween Costume Contest went off without a hitch in 12 year old Uncle Oscar's backyard in Abington.  Shy little rescue Pug Abby won the costume contest - looking adorable as a princess dressed all in pink, King Clovis took second place with his Hell's Puppies costume in denim with a black hoodie and a stovepipe hat, and Max took third place aptly dressed as HellBoy - he's the guy in the horns...  Uncle Oscar, looking amazingly like a gracious host from Channel 2 Public TV took one of the honorable mentions, Sebastion as Vampire took another honorable mention, and WHO took the third??  So many Pugs, so many costumes, your organizer had trouble keeping track!  I think it was Riley, the green monster, but if I'm wrong, somebody let me know and I'll add his or her name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were also glad to see Brady back in the group - and quickly discovered why he'd been absent.  He has a new little brother named Schilling!  Schilling spent the whole meetup roaring around like a tiny motorized toy, followed by a mob of delighted oldsters, both Puggie and human...  Pug puppies are insufferably cute, and little Schilling was no exception.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been especially good to see our shyest members - like little Abby the rescue and Seven, who never had Pugs to play with before, warming up to new friends.   If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby.  Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool.  There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have!  If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend.  Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Stoney's face when he sees those liver cupcakes!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1164464671000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163362061000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug November Meetup</name><id>5262265</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163962800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5262265/</event_url></item>
