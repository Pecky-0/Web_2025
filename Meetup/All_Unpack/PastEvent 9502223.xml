They offer almost 20 beers on draught - local, as well as national brews - and a generous selection of bottled beer, cider, and wine, along with what I hear is good food.  And on Friday nights there is live music too.  So come join me to celebrate the end of the week and kick back with a brew or two.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232559609000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231726207000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Finally its Friday at The Skellig</name><id>9502223</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232152200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/9502223/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/c/global_6907340.jpeg</photo_url></item>
