 This Boston Gardeners Council event will be dedicated to learning about compost provided through the City of Boston and increasing awareness and knowledge of compost as one of many approaches to soil improvement in our gardens. Susan Cascino, Director of Recycling from the Boston Department of Public Works, who oversees yard waste collection and city composting, will present on the Cityâ€™s compost plans for 2013. BNAN Garden Educator, Erika Rumbley, will lead an interactive workshop on compost and soil building. Come ready with your suggestions and questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first of a three-part series of community forums in January - March 2013. Stay tuned for date and location for the next two workshops in this important compost series.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Chaffee</member_name><member_id>46522682</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358298789000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Urban-Homesteaders-League</urlname><id>1466080</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Urban Homesteaders' League</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357934790000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Composts!
