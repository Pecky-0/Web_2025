I'm hosting game night at my house in Concord, NH on Monday, December 21, starting at 7pm and running until folks pack up to go home. (For reference, the closing time has been midnight and 11pm the past two Mondays, although folks can leave whenever they need to.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have specific games on the agenda other than the usual batch of new titles yet to be played, so feel free to make suggestions and maybe we can get it to the table...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP if you're in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261613220000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260988153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH – Monday, Dec. 21</name><id>12097637</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261440000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/12097637/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
