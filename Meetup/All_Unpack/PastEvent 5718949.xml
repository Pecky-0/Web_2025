<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will continue with a set of objections and replies to Meditations on First Philosophy. These objections were asked for by Descartes from his contemporary thinkers before publishing his book. They were included with his replies in the first edition. Sign of Descartes' very noble commitment to always doubt himself?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the edition of Descartes' work that were suggested the last time (The Philosophical Writings of Descartes Translated by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff and Dugald Murdoch, ISBN:052128807 for Vol I and ISBN:052128808 for Vol II) the Meditations with the objections and replies are in Vol II. The first two pairs of objections and replies seem an appropriate amount of reading from pp. 63 through pp. 121 in Vol. II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have an enjoyable reading, see you nest time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual there is plenty of information available on the internet about philosophy. One may be able to find even the original texts.
