Wedeln’s are always looking for a new adrenalin rush and the idea to sky dive came from a Groupon discount that was offered by Sky Jump of Pepperell, MA.  &lt;img src="http://www.skyjump.com/" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your tandem skydive you will experience the thrill of freefall and the serenity of a parachute canopy ride with only about an hour of ground training. Experience a heart-stopping moment as you stand at the edge of the aircraft door 10,500 feet above the ground. You will experience the joy and thrill of about 45 seconds of freefall. You and your tandem instructor will reach the speed of approximately 120 mph.&lt;br /&gt;Before your skydive all aspects of the jump will be explained, via videos and one-on-one training with your instructor. You will be shown the state of the art equipment that will be used. During the actual Tandem Skydive, you'll be securely attached to a professional tandem instructor who will assist you in pulling the ripcord and steering you to a safe landing.&lt;br /&gt;Tandem Skydiving is the ideal way to make your first skydive. Sky Jump has taken people of all ages, from 18 to 80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTE: Sky Jump tandem skydives includes a ride to an altitude of 10,500 feet above ground level (AGL) and we do not charge extra for the use of credit cards. PLUS, we jump out of a state-of-the-art Twin Otter which offers comfort and easy exits. Our price includes everything for a great skydive. Video and stills are extra at Pepperell as they are at all drop zones.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skydive Pepperell has:&lt;br /&gt;-  picnic tables for you (please feel free to bring breakfast/lunch with you as this may last the full day weather depending)&lt;br /&gt;-  shaded view area &lt;br /&gt;-  the best viewing site &lt;br /&gt;-  a new wind tunnel only 10 minutes away &lt;br /&gt;-  easy access to Manchester airport (only 5 miles from Rt 3.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.skyjump.com/directions" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pepperell, MA is located 10minutes from Nashua, NH which is roughly 50minutes north of Boston.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the jump is $225.00 per person (this may be reduced based on group number)&lt;br /&gt;Some things to know when considering jumping:&lt;br /&gt;•  What time do I need to be there Saturday, 8/28 if I decide to go?&lt;br /&gt;    o  8am (time will be confirmed Wednesday, 8/25/10)&lt;br /&gt;•  How long will I be there Saturday, 8/28?&lt;br /&gt;    o  Plan for half day but if there is bad weather it may be a full day&lt;br /&gt;•  How old do I have to be?&lt;br /&gt;    o  18yrs or older with a valid photo ID&lt;br /&gt;•  Is there a weight limit?&lt;br /&gt;    o  Yes, 225lbs&lt;br /&gt;•  What should I wear?&lt;br /&gt;    o  Comfortable clothes&lt;br /&gt;•  How do I get there?&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;img src="http://www.skyjump.com/directions" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bostonexpressbus.com/images/stories/schedules/web_BX_nashua_schedule_0709.pdf" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie Morrissey</member_name><member_id>9613620</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283630244000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281620389000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wedeln Sky Diving Adventure</name><id>14400830</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282996800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/14400830/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/8/global_14726280.jpeg</photo_url></item>
