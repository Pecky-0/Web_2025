&lt;p&gt;I love candlepin bowling! Please join me in the fun, and join me for lunch afterwards! We can decide on where to go get this well earned bite to eat while getting all these strikes and spares in our “serious” game. (Should I ask for bumpers?) ha ha ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 9:00 am in the lobby area and enroll in their Sunday morning special (go to the link for up to date rates). Their site isn’t clear if this cost covers the shoe rental. Bring a little extra money, in the chance that you need to pay for the shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bowling alley is located at 340 Amherst St Nashua NH. Below is the link to their site, with the up to date pricing and specials. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897. If you do not plan on coming, do not RSVP no.&lt;/p&gt;
