<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This hike is sponsored by our group and is a 3.0 mile looping hike of low to moderate effort on mostly forested land. There is a gradual upward trend for the first half of the hike on the South Boundary Loop and that is where some effort will be expended. A few stream crossings over small rough bridges of half logs and peaceful atmosphere prevail on this conservation land hike. Snow, rain, or shine the hike will go on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the lot at 2:30 PM and start the hike shortly thereafter. We should be done by about 4 PM. Optionally, we can go to one of the local eating establishments for an early dinner after the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: The McCann Family Farm is a hilly 84 acres of farmland and mixed forest.
