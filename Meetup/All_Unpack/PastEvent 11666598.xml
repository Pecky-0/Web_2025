Join SoJusters for Cocktails for Justice at Mantra* the day after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever wondered how to work a room at a cocktail party? Then join us from 6-7pm for a special skillshare called &amp;quot;The Art of the Schmooze&amp;quot;. Robbie Samuels, SoJust's Co-Organizer will cover the tools you'll need, how to set goals, how to initiate a conversation and perhaps most important - how to exit gracefully. You'll be able to put your new skills into practice right away when Cocktails for Justice - with no speaker or program - begins at 7pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't drink?  That's fine.  Plenty of folks don't.  The emphasis here is less on the cocktails and more on the socializing.  And even more so on the justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us if you want to &lt;i&gt;cross-promote your events and campaigns&lt;/i&gt; while enjoying great cocktails, are &lt;i&gt;new to the area&lt;/i&gt; and looking for groups to get involved in, or you've been looking for &lt;i&gt;like-minded progressives&lt;/i&gt; to hang with in Boston.  &lt;b&gt;Newcomers always welcomed!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hey organizers!&lt;/b&gt; If you're involved with a group or project and want to spread the word &lt;b&gt;bring flyers for the free lit table&lt;/b&gt; - and there'll be lots of opportunity to schmooze and network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Located near Park Street T stop (Green &amp;amp; Red Line) and Downtown Crossing (Orange Line).  The entrance is a little tricky to spot - &lt;a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3100/2841816626_946e8d6ebc.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;look for the big 52&lt;/a&gt;. Check out their menu at &lt;a href="http://www.mantrarestaurant.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.mantrarestaurant.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to connect outside of SoJust events?&lt;/b&gt; Members can view and post events, job &amp;amp; volunteer announcements, roommate searches, etc. on the website - just click '&lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/"&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt;'.  The &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/calendar"&gt;SoJust Calendar&lt;/a&gt; is packed with social justice-related events held throughout Greater Boston.  Help us keep it filled - tell us about events you hear about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From our FAQs:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;It's not very easy for me to meet new people and I'm not really one for small talk at bars.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hear you. That's why at SoJust events, in addition to traditional name tags, we have &amp;quot;Ask Me About&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Looking For&amp;quot; tags. That way you can slap whatever you're into lately up on your shirt and wait for fellow SoJusters to approach you. These seem to do the trick of moving past the basic &amp;quot;what do you do for work? where do you live?&amp;quot; questions to conversations that lead to more substantial connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;What actually happens at events?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll always be greeted by friendly folks who can help get you socializing, introduce you to people, and chat with you about questions or wishes. It's likely a few people will be there promoting their campaigns and issues (&lt;i&gt;yes, SoJust welcomes that sort of behavior&lt;/i&gt;). At our bigger events, there's always a literature table to toss down flyers, postcards, and other paraphenalia about events around town. Most importantly, we can pretty much guarantee there will be someone there you've never met before. As one of our members said, &amp;quot;You are bringing together people who might never get together otherwise - if that ain't a step towards justice I don't know what is.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?&lt;/b&gt; Check out our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3187615"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/photos/"&gt;Event Photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258414399000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256009761000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cocktails for Justice</name><id>11666598</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257375600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/11666598/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/3/global_11324323.jpeg</photo_url></item>
