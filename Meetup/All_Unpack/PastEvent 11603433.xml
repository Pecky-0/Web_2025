So only think I will be able to host one Meetup this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets see if we can't get some Halloween/Horror games on the table tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have looked into other nights/days and should be able to do gaming on nights other than Thursdays soon. Look for announcements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for some gaming on a Thursday evening. We will figure out from choices of a few games what one to play. Please only RSVP yes if you are going to attend. Hope to see some of you there. Questions please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tan ballcap ask for Wayne.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Wayne</member_name><member_id>1411667</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265931419000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>sagesofrpg</urlname><id>747276</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth, NH / Seacoast Boardgames Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255300583000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Spooktacular Gaming!</name><id>11603433</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255644000000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sagesofrpg/events/11603433/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/1/global_2300225.jpeg</photo_url></item>
