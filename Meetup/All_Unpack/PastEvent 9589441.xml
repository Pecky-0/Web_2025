Combined with video, real scientific specimens, a recreation of the Blaschka’s studio, and a rich assortment of memorabilia, these models of marine invertebrates offer intriguing insights into the history, personality, and artistry of the extraordinary men who created them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see: &lt;a href="http://www.hmnh.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hmnh.harva...&lt;/a&gt; for more info&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward we might go for a bite to eat in the square if any are interested and weather allows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside the front entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236469400000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Creative People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCreative</urlname><id>919281</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Creative People</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232765221000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blaschka Glass Art Exhibit</name><id>9589441</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234706400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCreative/events/9589441/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/1/a/global_7043402.jpeg</photo_url></item>
