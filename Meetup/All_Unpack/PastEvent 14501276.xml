Courtesy of Steven Flaherty, we now have a (free) place to meet. Thanks Steven!  He has volunteered to get us a room at Worcester State College for our meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first meeting will be a planning meeting, where we can discuss the ideas that members have posted and plan investigations for the rest of the year. Please come with all of your ideas, ready to get us rolling through the fall and into the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can feast on pizza and share our experiences with the paranormal, neat new investigation equipment, and so on.  After the meeting, depending on what the group wants to do, we could go to a movie or investigate the haunted tunnel in Clinton.&lt;br /&gt;I'd be willing to lead a group there--it's not too far from Worcester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN: Sunday, September, 19th, 6-8pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE: Worcester State College (see directions below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT TO BRING: Whatever you want to share with the group: (ideas for meetups, equipment, evidence, brownies...) and a flashlight if you want to go to the tunnel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: $2.00 for pizza and soft drinnks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt; Worcester State College  (Univerity)&lt;br /&gt;486 Chandler St.&lt;br /&gt;Worcester MA. 01602&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from the north:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rt. 2 East To  190 south&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 190 sonth  to  290 east&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;290 east  to exit 13 Kelly sq.
