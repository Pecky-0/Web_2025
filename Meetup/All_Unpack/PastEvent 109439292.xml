&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Not attending the swing dance outings because you don't know how to dance? Gone to a dance and want to do more than they teach in the beginner lesson? Here's your chance to learn! Swing is hot again, and as fun as ever. Learn triple rhythm and basic six-count moves, the foundation for all swing styles, including Lindy, Jitterbug, and Jive. Whether you like Big Band or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, George Strait or Dire Straits, oldies or new generation, you can swing to them all. Come with a partner, or come alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Taught by one of our own members (not some young whippersnapper), this class will get you ready to dance the night away. Classes are run through Arlington Community Education. We'd love to hear if you plan to attend, but you must register with ACE by going to their website at www.arlingtoncommunityed.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Classes are held on Wednesday evenings, beginning March 27, for 8 weeks. Time is 7:30-8:30 pm, and the cost is just $80. Class will be held at the Arlington Senior Center, right behind City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
