I curated it so I'm a little biased, but it got great reviews from the many people that have viewed it since it opened on Jan. 23.  The opening reception attracted over 150 people of all ages and interests. Come to this Saturday viewing when the museum won't be so crowded and maybe even purchase one of the artworks. It is large  variety of art styles, something for everyone.  Hope you can make it.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;Brighton-Allston Heritage Museum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 Chestnut Hill Avenue&lt;br /&gt;Brighton, Massachusetts 02135 USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://heritagemuseum.blogspot.com" target="_blank"&gt;HeritageMuseum.Blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;617-635-1436&lt;br /&gt;BAHeritageMuseum@gmail.com&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;SEEING AND SENSING ART:&lt;br /&gt;Allston, Brighton and Beyond&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brighton-Allston Heritage Museum&lt;br /&gt;Winship Gallery&lt;br /&gt;January 23, 2010 - March 13, 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Museum Hours - Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and 2nd/4th Saturday of the month - Noon to 4:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An art survey exhibition of over 70 two-dimensional paintings and photographs from 20 artists that focus on the splendor and majesty and diversity of contemporary and historical artwork over the past 150 years.
