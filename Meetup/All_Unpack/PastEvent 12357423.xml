We're delving into a bit of the sci-fi realm this time for a change and Neil Gaiman is supposed to be an excellent writer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're doing a repeat in terms of the location so we'll be at Unwined for this meeting. If you're a fondue fan, you'll love it. Unwined has a great cheese fondue plus an amazing selection of wine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal cap of 12 people applies so RSVP as soon as you can and, as always, if your plans change, please update your RSVP so another person can join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on the 24th!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267229602000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263864381000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet the American Gods</name><id>12357423</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267056000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/12357423/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
