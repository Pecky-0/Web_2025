This month we're going to try a new location: Boston Billiard Club.  Trivia starts at 8:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is LIVE bar-trivia, not a computerized game like you see at some places - If you're on the fence coming because you think trivia is too hard, or not 'your thing', think again; There's some challenge, but it's mostly fun!  We really need more 'sports-minded' people to join us since we're a little weak in this category.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teams are made up of 6 players (or less) - it's more fun to play with multiple teams so we can compete with each other (hint, hint...  please join us).  If you think of it, bring along ideas for our team's name.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday night is also &amp;quot;Ladies Night&amp;quot; - Cosmos for $5.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Billiards is just off exit 4, a little past the Holiday Inn.  It's located in the same building as Best Fitness.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;55 Northeastern Boulevard&lt;br /&gt;Nashua, NH 03062 USA&lt;br /&gt;Phone: 603-595-2121&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonbilliardclub.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonbill...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a "MEETUP" sign or Just Ask!  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth MacKenzie</member_name><member_id>3143060</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273780735000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273132350000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Team Trivia at Boston Billiards</name><id>13401810</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273707000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/13401810/</event_url></item>
