Each year, close to 30,000 people from across New England visit downtown Nashua to enjoy this FREE holiday event. The evening kicks off with a procession from City Hall to Railroad Square where the City&amp;rsquo;s official Christmas tree is lit. Much of the downtown is closed to traffic for the evening, allowing Strollers to enjoy the live entertainment, sample offerings from street vendors, dine in downtown&amp;rsquo;s fine restaurants and do holiday shopping at our unique specialty shops and boutiques. In 2008, we introduced an outdoor Beer Garden and it has grown to be a popular addition to the Stroll! Your favorite draft beers, warm winter cocktails, live music, activities, give-aways, and more! This is geared towards our 21+ &amp;ldquo;Strollers,&amp;rdquo; however under age children may enter with a parent &amp;amp; / or guardian. Wristbands are issues at the door; Valid ID required. Location: Corner of Main &amp;amp; High Streets Between Bank of America &amp;amp; Scontsas Jewelry Hours: 5 &amp;ndash; 10 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322349334000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322104156000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Outreach at Nashua "Holiday Stroll" / Outdoor Beer Garden</name><id>42234922</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322344800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/42234922/</event_url></item>
