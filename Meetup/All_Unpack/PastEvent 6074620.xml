Please arrange to carpool and bring a lunch with you for this trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 11:00 in the visitor center parking lot. From there we will walk and carpool to various parts of the park. There are numerous trails and 2 lookouts we can visit. I plan on leaving at 2:30. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quabbin Reservoir is one of the largest man-made public water supplies in the United States. Created in the 1930s by the construction of two huge earthen dams, the reservoir is fed by the three branches of the Swift River, and seasonally by the Ware River. Quabbin's water covers 39 square miles, is 18 miles long and has 181 miles of shoreline. When full, Quabbin holds 412 billion gallons of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Salem and Enfield lookouts offer magnificent views of the reservoir. In order to flood the vast area of the Swift River Valley in the 1930s, the entire population of four towns had to be relocated. Hundreds of homes, businesses, a state highway, a railroad line, and 34 cemeteries were also moved or dismantled. Over 6,000 graves were relocated from the Valley to Quabbin Park cemetery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/quabbin.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189436728000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185375129000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Day trip to Quabbin Reservoir</name><id>6074620</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189263600000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6074620/</event_url></item>
