Can you find the balance between CMS usability and performance? Have you considered data reuse? What about localization? Does maintaining Layouts induce carpal-tunnel syndrome? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Wednesday's lecture will discuss the impact Data Templates have on your Sitecore installation, the two most common design mistakes, and a practical solution. Developers should walk away with some pragmatic advice gleaned from a handful of really gnarly installations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're new to data template design, this talk will give you a great roadmap for your next Sitecore installation. Think you're a data template ace? come join the fun! Constructive criticism and alternate views are strongly encouraged!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff Cram</member_name><member_id>2226539</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick Cabral</member_name><member_id>10533883</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266728138000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Sitecore-User-Group-New-England</urlname><id>1535858</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Sitecore User Group - New England</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264081768000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February 2010 Sitecore Meetup - Data Templates and Sections - Technical Panel</name><id>12381518</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266447600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Sitecore-User-Group-New-England/events/12381518/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/9/global_13166569.jpeg</photo_url></item>
