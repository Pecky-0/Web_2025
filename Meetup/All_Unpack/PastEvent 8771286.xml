You’re educated, responsible and hard-working. You owe it to yourself to take charge of your future --especially when it comes to your finances! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have a raffle, so bring your business cards!  Light refreshments will be served, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added attraction, we have invited a woman who sells Italian designer handbags -- not knockoffs -- but without the designer prices!  She buys direct and passes the savings on to you!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come browse the latest in handbags, enter the raffle, and have a good time, all while learning how to build wealth and increase financial security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, Karen&lt;br /&gt;617-650-8716&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There will be signs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen K.</member_name><member_id>3407018</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222373369000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Professional Women</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Women-in-Business-Network</urlname><id>997886</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Women in Business Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221606488000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>You owe it to yourself...</name><id>8771286</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221777000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Business-Network/events/8771286/</event_url></item>
