We're sharing a special night with dinner at La Notte Restaurant in East Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Established in 1992. La Notte Restaurant is a great place to meet friends, business associates, or just to have a romantic dinner by the fireplace, or near the piano. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location of the restaurant is sitting on what was the club house for Tobacco Valley Golf Course. Because of the well-groomed grounds, it is a perfect setting for any occasion...even a snowy Valentine's Day.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 5 dining rooms and a lounge the restaurant is ideal and elegant. The dining room features either booths or mahogany tables with captain chairs. There is a piano player on Friday &amp;amp; Saturday nighs which is so very relaxing and dining by the fireplace is very inviting on cold winter nights. The color scheme of burgundy, ivory, and green add to the ambiance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food is superb with a variety of dishes to appeal to any appetite. Check out the menu...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.restaurantway.com/?restaurant=1452&amp;amp;view=restaurant" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.restaurant...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now...aren't you hungry? Well come and join us. Sit, relax, eat, laugh, drink and enjoy!
