 &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;ldquo;Photographing the Night Sky&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;

Tuesday September 13th 7:30PM &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

At Gateway Camera Club &lt;br /&gt;

Framingham, MA &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

New Members and Guests Welcome &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;This is a Free Program&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

An educational how-to program designed to open up our eyes to the possibility of &lt;br /&gt;

photographing landscapes with the star filled sky as a backdrop. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Equipment, tips, techniques, and camera setting for both star points and star trails will be &lt;br /&gt;

covered. We will also explore &amp;ldquo;light painting&amp;rdquo; of a foreground subject as well as overcoming &lt;br /&gt;

obstacles when the conditions are less than ideal. His e-book on the subject; &amp;ldquo;A Digital &lt;br /&gt;

Guide to Photographing the Night Sky&amp;rdquo; was released in Feb. 2011 and is available as both a &lt;br /&gt;

download from his site: www.roaminwithroman.com or as a hard copy CD. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Roman Kurywczak bio: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Roman started out attending art school for graphic design in the mid- 1980&amp;rsquo;s. During that &lt;br /&gt;

time, he received his first film camera and that moment changed the direction of his life &lt;br /&gt;

forever! The camera allowed him to combine his love of our natural world by giving him the tool to capture all that beauty in an artistic way. Roman immersed himself in all technical &lt;br /&gt;

aspects of photography, from his humble beginnings in a camera club, to now being a full &lt;br /&gt;

time professional nature photographer. He still looks back fondly at his early years because &lt;br /&gt;

at the camera club, he met the two people who would mentor him through the years and &lt;br /&gt;

soon become his friends. He has won numerous awards locally as well as nationally, but the &lt;br /&gt;

biggest satisfaction he has received over the years has been when he started his own tour &lt;br /&gt;

company in 1993, for photographers, that caters to small groups (only 4 participants in the &lt;br /&gt;

US) and provides individualized attention. The company has since grown to include &lt;br /&gt;

international destinations but the satisfaction he gets from teaching on his instructional &lt;br /&gt;

tours remians one of his most memorable photographic achievements and drives him to this &lt;br /&gt;

day. &lt;br /&gt;
