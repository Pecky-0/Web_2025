For those that do come early for happy hour the drink specials are for everyone.  I'll be in the happy hour bar area between 9 and 10pm.  I'll be with Dulce.  After 10pm I'll get our table and look for us in the VIP area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keys to the City and Seargent Peppers have given us a great offer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Happy hour drink specials from 5-8pm which includes 3 dollar drinks and drafts, free VIP section upstairs with a complimentary bottle of champagne.
