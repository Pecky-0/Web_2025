We're excited for another week of football, albeit in the cold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome all interested in playing flag-football to join us. We have a great group of people that welcome all players of all levels. And its a great way to meet new people, get exercise, and play flag-football. We don't keep score and we regard each others' safety as we play (minimal to no contact). Once you get to Cambridge Common, which is the park up the hill from the Harvard Square T-Stop, we warm up and then randomly count off teams.  You don't have to bring anything, except layers of clothing to keep you warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope that you can join us this week!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198075827000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197348440000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag-Football: Sat 2PM - Cambridge Common</name><id>6892716</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197745200000</time><rsvp_limit>26</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6892716/</event_url></item>
