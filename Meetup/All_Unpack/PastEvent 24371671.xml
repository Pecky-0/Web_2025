The book Haunted Hikes of New Hampshire calls the Devil&amp;#146;s Den Mountain &amp;#147;At only 1,110 feet, it&amp;#146;s hardly a mountain at all&amp;#133;&amp;#148; and says that &amp;#147;this rocky hill is an easy scramble to the top. From the summit, gaze upon the shimmering waters of Lake Winnipesauke near Rattlesnake Island.&amp;#148; The book also promises views of steep cavernous ledges carved into the granite surface by ancient glaciers before coming to the cave of the Devil&amp;#146;s Den. Just one of many spots in New Hampshire named after the Devil, legend has it that he has left his impression here as well as other locations throughout the state. The drive from Portsmouth to New Durham is about 45 minutes to an hour. If you would like to carpool, please email me and I will let you know of our designated meet-up spot. Pack snacks, water and a lunch, and prepare for climbing through some caves and tight spots. If you are claustrophobic, this is not the hike for you! Wear good boots or sneakers and bring a headlamp or flashlights that you can carry easy. And be prepared for about 2-3 hours for hiking, eating lunch and cave exploration. This is a free event and is open to the public. Feel free to invite friends or family members to join us. If you would like to borrow equipment such as a digital audio recorder, please let me know.
