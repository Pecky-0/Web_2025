as ones who enjoy going within, you may want to experience another way of working with consciousness with Shamanic Journey. This new program will be held on Saturday June 9 at A Higher Balance. I hope you can join us! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Shamanic Journey &lt;span style="color : #008080"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter the doorway to Wisdom and Guidance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

with Dave Estes and Judy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Saturday, June 9, 10-noon $40 &lt;br /&gt;

Limited to 12 - RSVP please through Meetup &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Following a welcoming circle and sacred ceremony, Dave and Judy will offer sound currents to escort you to your inner realms for clarity and guidance. You will go on two journeys. Repetitive drum with the deep resonance of the didgeeridoo will make it easy for you to enter the depths of your soul. &lt;br /&gt;

     Your wisdom guides await, with gifts and messages to point your way. Prior to the first Journey, you will receive the Seers Rite--one of the Sacred Rites of the Munay-Ki. this initiation brings forth an ability to see with the heart and open to multidimensional realities. &lt;br /&gt;

    Wear comfortable clothing and bring a journal. Limited to 12 - you must register: 781-639-1236. &lt;br /&gt;

Comments from past participants: &lt;em&gt;"Wow it was powerful and I want to do this again"..."I can't believe how deep I went"..."So easy to access my guide, and it was amazing" &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;Blankets and pillows are provided. You will be lying down for the Journeys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
