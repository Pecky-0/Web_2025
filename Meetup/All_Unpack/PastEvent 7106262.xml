Get your travel documants ready so you can join us for our Memorial Day long weekend in Quebec City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brunch event will be the launch of the weekends events. A full schedule of events will be planned. Everyone is responsible for their own transportation and hotel accomodations. Its exactly 400 miles from Boston to Quebec, so everyone should carpool. You might want to consider spending Friday night in northern New Hampshire to split up the drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link with a list of Quebec City hotels:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quebec-hotels.ca/en/membres.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.quebec-hot...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SATURDAY BRUNCH:&lt;br /&gt;In the heart of VIEUX QUEBEC, this &amp;quot;Little Corner of Brittany&amp;quot; is a world where the crêpe is king! Waitresses are attired in full Breton dress ? tall caps, long dresses and pristine aprons. Try the ham and asparagus stuffed crêpe topped with béchamel sauce. Not to your liking? Well, never fear. They offer more than 80 varieties of crêpes, but considering their &amp;quot;create your own&amp;quot; policy, maybe that number will rise to 81 after your visit. The perfect eatery for either breakfast or brunch.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211810868000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200258698000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Breakfast in Quebec</name><id>7106262</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211637600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7106262/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/1/e/global_2969918.jpeg</photo_url></item>
