You guys are Big Ten College Football junkies so lets do it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a great place to watch all the Big Ten college football games called &amp;quot;The Tavern Square&amp;quot; which is located less then 5 minutes from Central Square T Stop on the Redline.  The manager promised me this was a great place to watch games as they have an enourmous amount of TV's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on October 31st at 3:30 P.M. lets meet at The Tavern Square to watch the Michigan vs. Illinois game which is in between a prior game and another one at 8pm.  I know its Halloween but I figured what a better way to celebrate the Fall Holiday with College Football, Good Friends and of course lots of &amp;quot;Fall Flavored Beer&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP as soon as you know on the Meetup website, I have to give the manager a count about a week before so I can reserve us tables.  Looking forward to seeing  everybody then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Rosen&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve rosen</member_name><member_id>3640517</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257193306000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Midwesterners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Midwesterners</urlname><id>545362</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ex-Midwesterners Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255453609000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Halloween College Football Fest</name><id>11617449</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1257017400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Midwesterners/events/11617449/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/global_4872018.jpeg</photo_url></item>
