<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I am starting a series of hikes for those of us who want to start getting (back) into hiking and need to build up some stamina and endurance before attempting the rockier terrains and steeper inclines!  Hikes will be taken at a slower pace, with gains of 1000 feet or less and most will be 3 - 4 miles and take about half a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mount Williard Trail is up an old carriage road, so the grade is moderate and the trail well packed.  It's about 1.5 miles to the top, with an elevation gain of 900 feet.  There are ledges near the summit with some beautiful views.  We can also go take a look at Hitchcock Flume, if we want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mount Willard Trail in conjunction with the Avalon Trail crosses the tracks behind the depot/visitor center, and immediately enters the woods. At .1 mi. the Avalon Trail goes straight ahead where the Mount Willard Trail branches L. The Mount Willard Trail runs level soon crossing a brook before beginning a moderate ascent. After about a mile, the grade lessens, and at 1.4 miles an unsigned and poorly-cleared path leads steeply downhill to the head of Hitchcock Flume. The main trail continues .1 miles to the ledges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herd paths lead to additional views in both directions. The true summit is perhaps .1 miles behind in the woods, with no trail.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Even though this hike is for those of us just starting out (or starting again) please be prepared for an uphill walk which may feel strenuous at times!  Bring proper clothing (no jeans, decent hiking boots, a jacket) and carry at least 2 quarts of water and some snacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to find the trailhead:&lt;br /&gt;From I-93 exit 35 near Franconia Notch, follow US Route 3 about 11 miles N to the junction of US Route 302 in Twin Mountain, turn R on US Route 302 and go E about 8.7 miles&lt;br /&gt;Parking adjacent to the depot is signed for short term use only, check inside for parking or use the Webster-Jackson Trail parking lot .2 miles toward the notch. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be at the Crawford Notch Visitor Center by 9:45am.  I have a bright orange backpack and a big smile.
