We'll attend some events, lectures, readings, signings, and spend some time releasing bookcrossed books as well in good bookcrossing spirit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on participant interest, we'll open with a release walk around the premises of Copley / Boston Public Library. We'll do a release as well during lunchtime, which is when most attendees are out and about. Most importantly, the festival is a wonderful time to catch up with fellow bookcrossers and meet book lovers in the Boston community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual Boston Book Festival is a testament to the strength of the reading and literary communities in Boston, and always promises to be a fun time. Check out their website at: &lt;a href="http://bostonbookfest.org/"&gt;http://bostonbookfest.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to more traditional panels and lectures, there are exhibitors from independent presses, a special imagination area for kids, workshops for budding writers, a discussion of one story designated as the "One City One Story" (this year by Anna Solomon), and a session called "Writer Idol" where untested writers read in front of a panel of literary expert judges. Check the website for complete schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your yellow Boston Unconvention bags (if you have one) and your bookcrossing books! If you want to come to the Festival later in the day, just be sure to coordinate by letting us know when you'll be coming.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be next to the statues on the steps of the Boston Public Library</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>H H</member_name><member_id>6628358</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351428307000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349212225000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SPECIAL - Boston Book Festival 2012 with Bookcrossing release walk</name><id>85176192</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351346400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/85176192/</event_url></item>
