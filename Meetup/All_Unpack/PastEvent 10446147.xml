The game plan is to warm-up with some rallies and then break out into some games or singles, doubles and round robin play!  We are here to have fun, get to know each other and play Tennis!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School offers plenty of opportunity to play tennis on its 6 tennis courts and two practice backboards.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great opportunity to just show-up and play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Day, Date &amp;amp; Time: Saturday October 17th&lt;br /&gt;*Location: Braintree High School&lt;br /&gt;*Meeting Place: At the Tennis Courts between the practice boards and door to the courts on the side of fields (not the street/parking side).  &lt;br /&gt;*Alternate Meeting Place: Look for us on one of the courts.
