The NFL's longest rivalry with 185 games and between them 22 NFL championships and 48 Hall of Famers. The Bears still hold the record for the most total wins and have a record of 92-87-6 vs the Packers. This is also a huge game with playoff implications.  If the Packers win, they win the division.  The Bears need to win 2 out of the remaining 3 and things to fall right.  We are the guests of the Chicago Sports Club. Bears-Packers, what is more Midwestern than that? Courtside has been remodeled with a new sound system. In the bar area, the game will be on with sound.  I would like to meet each of you and hear any ideas that you have for this club.&lt;/p&gt;
