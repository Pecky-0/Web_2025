It's located in Plymouth and Carver. They have plenty of trails and hundreds of acres of forest.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate has agreed to lead this hike. Please plan for a moderate to fast pace, and about 2 hours in the woods. Please bring plenty of snacks and water for you and your pet. Below is a link to a map of the forest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please meet at Gate 30, it is a good sized parking lot.
