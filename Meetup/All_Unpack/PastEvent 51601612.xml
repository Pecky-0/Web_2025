&lt;p&gt;About the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay, &lt;em&gt;A Separation&lt;/em&gt; is a compelling drama about the dissolution of a marriage in contemporary Iran. Simin (Leila Hatami) wants to leave Iran to provide better opportunities for her daughter. When her husband Nader (Peyman Moadi) refuses to leave behind his Alzheimer-suffering father, Simin sues for divorce. But her request fails, so she returns to her parents' home&amp;mdash;without her daughter. Nader hires a young woman to assist with his father in his wife's absence, hoping that his life will return to a normal state. However, when he discovers that the new maid has been lying to him, he realizes that there is more on the line than just his marriage. Winner of four awards at the Berlin International Film Festival, including the Golden Bear for Best Film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the movie we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
