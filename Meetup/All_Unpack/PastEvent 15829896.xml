Chill out on Chaibo's comfy couches and enjoy a latte, smoothie, Panini or dessert (Try their gelato. Yum!) as we discuss &lt;i&gt;The Red Tent&lt;/i&gt; by Anita Diamant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are descriptions of the book by Library Journal and an Amazon Reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Library Journal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Skillfully interweaving biblical tales with events and characters of her own invention, Diamant's sweeping first novel re-creates the life of Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob, from her birth and happy childhood in Mesopotamia through her years in Canaan and death in Egypt. When Dinah reaches puberty and enters the Red Tent (the place women visit to give birth or have their monthly periods), her mother and Jacob's three other wives initiate her into the religious and sexual practices of the tribe. Diamant sympathetically describes Dinah's doomed relationship with Shalem, son of a ruler of Shechem, and his brutal death at the hands of her brothers. Following the events in Canaan, a pregnant Dinah travels to Egypt, where she becomes a noted midwife. Diamant has written a thoroughly enjoyable and illuminating portrait of a fascinating woman and the life she might have lived.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Amazon Reviewer (edited slightly):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It would appear that any book about interesting and perhaps unusual women generates much controversy among its readership (&amp;quot;Bitter Grounds&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Poisonwood Bible&amp;quot; come to mind). This book is no different.&lt;/i&gt; The Red Tent &lt;i&gt;is loosely based on the Biblical story of Dinah, but it is a novel, not fact, even though it may be based in fact. Diamant even takes liberties with the Dinah story as it appears in Genesis in the Bible. However, it does appear to be thoroughly researched -- I found myself equally fascinated by descriptions of life during Biblical times as by the lives of the characters in the book. Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn't find this book to be anti-male. I and many women I know lead very different lives from our men and we too see them in a completely different light than they see themselves. We often laugh at them or paint them in an unflattering light, despite the fact that we love them.  I personally found this book full of thoughts and ideas that touched me deeply. I identified with some of the “human condition” scenarios in the book. I have wholeheartedly recommended this book to several people and recommend it to you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be at the set of couches closest to the door.
