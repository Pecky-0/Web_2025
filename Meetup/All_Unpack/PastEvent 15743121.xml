While that goal might seem modest to some and ambitious to others, the EmpowerME team is &lt;b&gt;actively seeking input, ideas and help in prioritizing items for the plan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I believe that members of this permaculture group are especially qualified to help surface some&lt;b&gt; very positive and creative approaches to &amp;quot;energy descent&amp;quot; that can create a much stronger plan&lt;/b&gt; and help our whole region navigate the challenges ahead with greater success and resilience.  Some of us are motivated by peak oil, some by climate change, some by economic volatility or - knowing many of you - all of the above!  Your voices are valued in this conversation, which will be facilitated by yours truly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portland Venue TBD based on RSVP levels&lt;br /&gt;6:30 Potluck Supper (pls bring a dish to share and your potluck kit!)&lt;br /&gt;7:00 Announcements and Start of Session&lt;br /&gt;8:30 Wrap-up!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;LisaF, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The initiative is currently supported by Greater Portland Council of Governments, Clean Air - Cool Planet, and Cumberland County using funds from a US DOE Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant.  Participants from across the region are facilitating these sessions on a volunteer basis.
