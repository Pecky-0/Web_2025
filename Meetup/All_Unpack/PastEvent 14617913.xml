A one-mile route is also optional. Several water stops and rest areas are available around the route. Course monitors are placed throughout the five miles, directing and motivating walkers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Walk to Cure Cancer is the largest, single-day fundraising event in Central Massachusetts benefitting the UMass Memorial Cancer Center at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Funds raised support cutting-edge research and wide-ranging preventive and behavioral studies to provide advanced cancer care to oncology patients. The center integrates some of the most vital cancer research and treatment activities available today The Center encourages innovative collaborations and actively promotes the development of projects dedicated to bringing the work of the bench to the bedside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, the five mile walk-a-thon has raised over $6 million enabling cutting edge cancer research, bringing us one step closer to finding a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll need folks to photograph teams again this year- is anyone interested in doing this?
