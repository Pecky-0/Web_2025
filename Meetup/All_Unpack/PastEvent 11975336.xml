For more info on contra dancing, one can &amp;quot;google&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;youtube&amp;quot; it. They usually charge $7 at the door. It's a fun and social atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On street parking can usually be found on side streets. There's a parking lot on Brook St. just southeast of the intersection with Waterman St. I've heard conflicting info as to whether parking is free on the W/E's. The entrance to Alumni Hall is on the left side of the building. Bring water, you'll be thirsty. Dress in comfortable clothes and possibly hard soled shoes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>sellingsanctuary</member_name><member_id>3325851</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260147532000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259530007000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Contra Dance</name><id>11975336</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259973900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/11975336/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/e/global_10842414.jpeg</photo_url></item>
