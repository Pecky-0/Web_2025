<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Farmington Canal was built in the early 1800’s from New Haven to Northampton.  This provided a less expensive way of transporting goods than through Hartford.  The canal, being expensive to maintain and subject to disruptions from weather, closed in 1848.  At that time the Farmington Canal Railroad took over the right of way and provided trail service on the route.  As trucks and automobiles took over from the railroad, it closed in 1988.  Then it was converted into a rail trail with new bridges and a paved surface.  See their web site: &lt;a href="http://www.fvgreenway.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fvgreenway...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be walking from Copper Hill Rd in East Granby into Southwick.  There are marshes and newly open sections of trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 4 miles on a flat paved surface.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  (Approximate address, no mailbox there) 96 Copper Hill Rd, East Granby, CT.  A small parking lot is next to the trail.  Additional parking is 500 feet the west.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=96+Copper+Hill+Rd,+east+Granby,+CT&amp;amp;sll=41.973985,-72.757548&amp;amp;sspn=0.002457,0.004452&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=96+Copper+Hill+Rd,+East+Granby,+Hartford,+Connecticut+06026&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276643263000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275179219000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Farmington Canal Rail-Trail Walk, East Granby, CT</name><id>13635826</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276450200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/13635826/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
