Hopefully the weather will cooperate for a lovely sunset with the western views off of the cliffs. If the weather is good for a sunset, we will linger on the cliffs to see it (make sure you bring a headlamp or flashlight in case we need it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike may be short but the start will be a lot of exertion as we ascent over 300 feet fairly quickly. We start out In the Giuffrida Park parking lot and hike past the dam for Crescent Lake. This part may be a little wet as we have to cross below the dam where the trail crosses the spillway. Then we hike up the steep side of the ridge and climb only an easy 15 feet or so of traprock. The path to climb like steep stairs. The reward is great though as at the top, on Chauncey Peak, is a WONDERFUL vista! The trail follows the cliff edge to the north with a great view of the lake below and Lamintation Mtn. on the other side of the lake. The views get more natural and lovely as we follow the ridge. Eventually, as we get past the lake, the trail will cut down steeply from the ridge line. There is no climbing, but you need to watch your step lest you slip a little on leaves, dirt, or scree. The path continues by the side of the lake with a pleasant walk through the old evergreens with a few benches at lakeside and back to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will take up to 1.75 hrs. for this hike as we take deep appreciation for the views from the cliffs and lakeside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who wish to go need to have: &lt;br /&gt;

 * A daypack - You need your hands free &lt;br /&gt;

* Trail appropriate footwear - hiking boots are the best &lt;br /&gt;

* &lt;strong&gt;Flashlight or headlamp&lt;/strong&gt; - as we are hiking at/after sunset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
