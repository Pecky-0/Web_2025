<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Ciao Tutti,   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have planned a dinner venue for us on the 13th of November. This is a local Italian restaurant that is owned by Italians. They come from Naples and speak Italian. I have arranged for the owners daughter who speaks Italian to be our server. We will try our best to order in Italian as well as speak to the best of our ability that evening. I feel the best way to handle dinner is split the bill for food and cocktails on your own. This way if you don't drink you are not stuck with a large bill. I went to another Meetup that handled it this way and works out great. So we will split the food portion and drinks we will pay on our own. I do need only YES if you mean YES. I do have to give an accurate count on the 6th of November so first come first serve. But please RESPOND YES ONLY IF YOU ARE 100% SURE ON COMING.  &lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ciao, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Amato &lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>sign and reservations</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Amato</member_name><member_id>3621990</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227659683000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Italian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-420</urlname><id>447590</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Italian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223780956000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Parliamo e Mangia al Gianfranco's Ristorante &amp; Bar</name><id>8945494</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226620800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-420/events/8945494/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/4/global_2557124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
