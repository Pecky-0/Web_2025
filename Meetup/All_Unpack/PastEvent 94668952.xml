&lt;p&gt;Looking for Parking? &lt;br /&gt;

Street - Orange, Court, and Chapel have metered street parking with some also on State and Elm an extra block over. (~$1.50/hr) &lt;br /&gt;

Garage -The Garage at 360 State Street is very close, enter down the ramp on State between Court and Chapel.  If you pay close attention to how you are leaving then there is an exit dirrectly out onto Pitkin Plaza, which O'Toole's borders on.  Otherwise it's just around the other side of the block.  (It's pricier though, I don't remember how much.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Debi will host, her contact info is in the description.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355409507000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355064025000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia at O'Tooles (12/12)</name><id>94668952</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355360400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/94668952/</event_url></item>
