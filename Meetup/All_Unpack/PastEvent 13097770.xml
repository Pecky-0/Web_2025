A feeling of good energy that surrounds you as it enlightens your senses and clears your minds. It can awaken the soul and soothe the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome you to experience a Kung Fu tea ceremony with Erik Harris at his home. Erik will conduct the tea ceremony with various wild organic teas from the mountains of China, hand picked from trees that are 500 years old and grown 1,000 feet up on the mountain. These teas are filled with pure vital energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tea, we will practice Qi Gong movements to increase energy and promote healing. It is world Tai Chi and Qi Gong day on April 24th. Everywhere around the world people will be practicing allowing energy to flow through them. Together, join us as we will tap into this healing energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info about Erik, please see his website... &lt;a href="http://www.chiforhealing.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.chiforhealing.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $10&lt;br /&gt;Date: Saturday, April 24&lt;br /&gt;Time: 4 - 6 pm&lt;br /&gt;Directions will be emailed to all who sign up a few days before the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://koyumatcha.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/ceremony.png" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>erik  harris</member_name><member_id>10967674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272312834000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270516011000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tea &amp; Qi Qong</name><id>13097770</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272139200000</time><rsvp_limit>9</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/13097770/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/c/global_14178332.jpeg</photo_url></item>
