I want to stress to all of you that no matter what the source or the intensity of your distress, these same methods will work just as successfully for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are inviting you to another evening of learning and healing and sharing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this event, you will continue exploring how anxiety and depression are manifestation of energy displacement, as we practice techniques to realign your energy. You will be learning how to open and keep open the Energy Gates, which are the major energy relay stations of the body and a vehicle through which the flow of our vital energy is directed that keeps the body aligned and balanced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. We will be going over the simple step-by-step processes to stimulate and balance your brain that will significantly lower your stress levels and levels of brain chemicals related to anxiety, (and increase your production of vital and very pleasurable brain chemicals related to your well-being).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Those who have experienced trauma are often scared of what is going on with them and are afraid that they have been changed permanently. That is definitely not so.  We will continue this time with specific applications that can be used by anyone who want to experience a palpable change in how they are feeling right now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You will dramatically improve your ability to sleep better, focus, concentrate and think more clearly. These techniques can be used in any future situations when you feel scared and overwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Unfortunately millions of people have no choice but to try to live in the debilitating state of discomfort that results from energetic misalignment. You certainly do not need to be one of them. I am inviting you to embark on an exciting journey to the new anxiety and trauma-free you. Let us get started. Join us for a highly experiential presentation, live demonstration and personal practices. Warm welcome to everyone! I am looking forward to meeting all of you!&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;  Yuliya Cohen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schedule&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:45 – 7:15 Free introduction for new Meetup participants.
