I just think that many of us live on different schedules and I want to give everyone many opportunities to go to meet-ups. It’s totally fine if it’s only 2, 3 or 4 of us that are coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are doing twitter please follow me for updates here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/worldmusicmeet" target="_blank"&gt;http://twitter.com/wo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join the group on facebook ( a good opportunity to set-up your own profile page if you did not already)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8251889251" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday June 24 an exceptional group is coming to Boston and even so the ticket price is a little high I will be there.  The show start at 8 PM but I think that there is an opening act. We could meet in front of the Paradise Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are into Afrobeat, this is the artist that you don't want to miss! I have seen Femi Kuti a few times and I have never been disappointed  &lt;br /&gt;They've got it all: a killer rhythm &amp;amp; percussions section, back-up vocalist and dancers that are so hot they'll give you chills, a huge horn section totally disciplined and always grooving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Femi Kuti is definitely a top African artist, he is an amazing vocalist, an outstanding sax player that have found his own voice and he keeps coming with great, new and refreshing compositions! &lt;br /&gt;In my book he is holding high the Afrobeat flame started by his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/femikuti" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WED, June 24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    FEMI KUTI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    (from Nigeria / Afrobeat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Paradise Rock Club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    967 Commonwealth Avenue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    For info/tickets: www.LiveNation.com $25&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In front of the club at 8:00 PM</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacques Pardo / Atlas Soul</member_name><member_id>7850955</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247183026000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245085400000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Femi Kuti</name><id>10655555</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245888000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/10655555/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/2/6/global_9172646.jpeg</photo_url></item>
