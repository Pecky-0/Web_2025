The suggested the reading is the remainder of the book, the third part, from pp.533 until pp. 599 in Walter Kauffman's translation: &amp;quot;Basic Writings of Nietzsche&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. The location RedLine is just next door from Bombay Club on the first floor. It is tentative for now until I'll be able to reserve the place actually. (If we can not get a space there, then we can go to Rendang or Bombay Club.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For now we will continue meeting at the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month and that's why we are having our next meeting in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1166918878000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1165666986000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nietzsche: On the Genealogy of Morals II</name><id>5316653</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1166745600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5316653/</event_url></item>
