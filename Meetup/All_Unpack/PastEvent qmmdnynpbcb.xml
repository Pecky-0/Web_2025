This talk explores the genesis of the great challenges of doubt and mistrust, and the pathway to trusting the goodness that is our essence.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included will be a short meditation and a time to set intentions for the coming week. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world. We'd love to have your join us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288653088000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tara Brach: "Trusting who we are."</name><id>qmmdnynpbcb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288648800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/15264750/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
