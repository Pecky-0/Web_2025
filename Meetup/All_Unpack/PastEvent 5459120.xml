<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our next meetup is at 729 Hope St. Join us for coffee, pastry, a wide-ranging, informal discussion of anything related to programming with PHP, or all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, we'll probably share some of the projects we're working on, so bring some screenshots or a quick demo if you'd like. (If this starts to run long, we can always go into more depth next month.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The restaurant closes at 8 PM, so it's a good idea to get there by 7 PM if you want to get some food without having to tear yourself away from the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Shearer</member_name><member_id>1529786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173398798000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>PHP Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>php-338</urlname><id>282097</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Providence PHP Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170810377000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence PHP Meetup March Meetup</name><id>5459120</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1173225600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/php-338/events/5459120/</event_url></item>
