We will be going to the farm again to help do some work, love some animals and have a potluck.  I'd like to start setting that up for every couple of weeks over the warmer months either way. If anyone has other suggestions for the next Meet Ups please let me know. We also need to go out to Purgatory Chasm sometime soon as well. Can't wait to hear some ideas!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions you can reach me at 508-459-1074 or you can email me as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309486802000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241281240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp June Meetup</name><id>10319475</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244394000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/10319475/</event_url></item>
