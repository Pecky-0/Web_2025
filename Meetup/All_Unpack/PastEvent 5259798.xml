No-shows are a no-no!!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, we can't wait for late-comers because it is an inconvenience for the restaurant and for the rest of the group who have arrived on time.  I appreciate your understanding and consideration with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please allow yourself enough time to get there.  Parking is tight in the area, so taking the red line is the best way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the event gets full, keep checking because often times people cancel a day or two ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give out my cell phone # to the folks who reply yes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have a bright golden-yellow LL Bean jacket and I'll carry a flower, so it will be easy to find me.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1166045760000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163263633000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at Harvard Gardens</name><id>5259798</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165681800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/5259798/</event_url></item>
