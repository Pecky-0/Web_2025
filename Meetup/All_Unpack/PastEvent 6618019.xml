A new member has offered a new place for us to meet! Jeff Baker has a nice studio in Worcester and it looks like that's where we will head for our meeting. directions &lt;a href="http://visionsbybaker.smugmug.com/gallery/3014651" target="_blank"&gt;http://visionsbybaker...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd love it if you all could bring at least one new photo to show at this meeting. Let's look at and talk about what we are doing and any projects we are working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also need to talk about our holiday party and print swamp for Dec! It's an annual tradition that folks seem to love. So let's make it good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to see you all again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196634782000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193357080000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography November Meetup</name><id>6618019</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196382600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/6618019/</event_url></item>
