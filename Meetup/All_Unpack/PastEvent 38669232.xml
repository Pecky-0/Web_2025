&lt;p&gt;This will be the&amp;nbsp;LAST Happy Hour at Artichokes until the Spring of 2012. Melody has reserved the entire lower level of Artichokes for this evening.

Sample the martini and wine lists, have a drink at the bar, order dinner from the full menu, relax and socialize in this intimate setting.&lt;/p&gt;
