&lt;p&gt;Bob, Laurie, Wayne, Paula and the rest of the crew at Laurie's 909 are sick of Winter and having a Beach Party with entertainment by the band, The Boys of Summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join the Red Sox Natives and other invited groups for a 2013 Beach Party at Laurie's 9:09 in Wakefield on Saturday, March 9 from 9:00pm to 1:00am.&lt;/p&gt;
