&lt;p&gt;The Ipswich Humane Group is teaming up with Marini Farms in Ipswich to host a Doggy Maze Daze Fundraiser to support the Ipswich animal shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One weekend only Marini Farm will open the corn maze for pet owners and their four legged friends! You can bring your canine companions and get lost in the maze! There will also be face painting for the kids, doggy massage and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: September 8 &amp;amp; 9 â€” 10 am - 6 pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where: Marini Farms at 259 linebrook Rd, Ipswich, Massachusetts &lt;br /&gt;

 (The farm is located just one mile east of Route 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults (Age 13+) $10.00 &lt;br /&gt;

 Youth (Age 4-12) $8.00 &lt;br /&gt;

 Four Legged Friends FREE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 10 miles of family friendly pathways in the maze with helpers perched high above to guide you if you need it. It is very well run with lots of fun things to do once you are inside the maze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHG will be handing out free baggies to everyone that enters the maze for their dogs. Dogs must be leashed in the maze to be safe. After the maze you can also visit their jumping pillow, take a hayride, try the apple cannons and more for an additional fee. There will also be a "doggie mall" that guests can visit for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday 11am to 2pm The Ipswich Humane Group will offer free dog massage (dogs love it!!) and you can meet David and Lilly the Hero Pit Bull at their booth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A portion of the proceeds benefit The Ipswich Humane Group Animal Shelter. &lt;br /&gt;

 The Ipswich Humane Group is an all volunteer, non-profit group that assists Ipswich ACO to enable a no-kill animal shelter for the Town of Ipswich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347185680000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345407975000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doggy Maze Days for Dog Owners and Their Families!
