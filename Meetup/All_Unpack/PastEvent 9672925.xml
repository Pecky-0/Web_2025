<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>As discussed at the January meeting, and originally scheduled for our February meeting, this month we will take a &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; look at options as an alternative method to trading straight equities. I promise to keep things simple enough that those who know absolutely nothing about options will feel comfortable and everyone will walk away with some concrete information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added treat, Jeff promised to supply coffee and donuts in exchange for an introductory discussion on this particular topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! &lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy operating the projector and laptop.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raymond Dreczko</member_name><member_id>4521820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237587084000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>IBD Enthusiasts and Traders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ibd-739</urlname><id>559772</id><group_lat>41.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233774036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charlestown IBD Forum</name><id>9672925</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237413600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ibd-739/events/9672925/</event_url></item>
