Here is his intro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This discussion of the first book of Plato’s republic reaches back to the topic of another meeting a few months ago. It was about the topic of good and bad and evil. Well, Plato started it here with Book I of the Republic. Let’s try to trace back the arguments of Socrates and his questioner Polemarchus and his sophist opponent Trasymachus. The debate is going around the topic of justice, and its (possible) conclusions are bothering us to this very day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trasymachus argues that might is right. What, if anything is wrong with that argument? &lt;br /&gt;Is it possible, and does Socrates try to defend the existence of a universal notion of justice? &lt;br /&gt;What is Plato/Socrates trying to tell us? &lt;br /&gt;How can we know that we are right? &lt;br /&gt;If we believe that we are right, then why is it wrong  (or not) to “convince” others? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text is fascinating reading and it is puzzling how the problems addressed in it are valid even today.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Andras&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1119992722000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1116799663000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book I of the Republic</name><id>4711986</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1119819600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/4711986/</event_url></item>
