<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Join Kathy and co-lead Diane K. for a hike up Mt. Flume via the Lincoln Woods and Osseo Trails. This will be a round trip of 11.2 miles with 3150' of elevation gain--a long walk in the woods and a more gradual route up Flume for those wishing to forego the steeper route from Franconia Notch. Hopefully there will be some foliage at or near peak to enjoy along the way! Bring warm layers (including hat/gloves), lunch, and plenty of water for this all-day hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be joined by the Seacoast Dayhikers and GoNewEngland for our hike and perhaps if we're lucky, we'll also bump into Diane and Paul's group along the way. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weather looks questionable, check back here for last minute updates. I'll post a cell phone number a day or two before the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpool Locations:&lt;br /&gt;- 8:00 AM Depart Concord NH LL Bean Plaza Hannaford side off exit 14 off 93&lt;br /&gt;- Lincoln Woods 9:30 AM I-93 Exit 32 onto Route 112 (Kancamagus Highway), 5.7 miles then left into parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/4/2008 Update:&lt;br /&gt;Looks like beautiful but COLD weather for Sunday. Please be prepared for temps potentially in the 30's and 40's up high and bring extra layers so that you'll be comfortable and warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy will already be in NH and will meet people at Lincoln Woods. Diane K. will be handling the car pool from the LL Bean/Hanaford Plaza in Concord.
