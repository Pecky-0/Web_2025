&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Armsby Abby during stART on the street for some drinks, conversation, and browsing local artist booths. Streets will be closed in the area, but ample parking is easily found nearby. Come join us to soak in Worcester life. &lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a group of people and say the secret word...
