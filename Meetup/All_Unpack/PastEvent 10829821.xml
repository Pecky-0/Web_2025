Based on a suggestion from a member we will be trying the Cottage Wellesly this month.  We will meet in the bar area, grab a drink or two and socialize. IN WELLESLY IF YOU ORDER AN ALCHOHOLIC BEVERAGE YOU MUST ORDER FOOD (APPETIZER AT A MINIMUM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us for an evening out. Once again, remember that if you RSVP we are expecting you. If your plans change please be considerate of others and update your RSVP as soon as possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send my cell # to &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; RSVP's so that you can let me know of any last minute cancellations or if you have difficulty finding us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe RSVP's should update their RSVP as soon as their plans are known.  No later than 7/22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the bar area.  Look for me or other members of the group.
