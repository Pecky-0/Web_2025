We will meet at the launch site on Doane Hill Road, Royalston, MA just east of the entrance to Tully Lake Campground.  The trip up to Long Pond along the river is about 5 miles round trip.  The trip into Tully Lake can be around 6-8 miles depending on how many nooks and crannies we explore.  Since we will have to pass the launch site from pond to lake, you can make the trip shorter by just doing one leg of the trip.  We'll take a vote and decide which leg to do first (river and pond, or lake).  Once we are finished paddling, you may join Susan L. and me at our campsite at Tully Lake campground for dinner and a campfire (please bring your own dinner and a chair).   You may have to pay a small ($5?) visitor fee to come into the campsite - but I am not sure how strictly that is enforced.  Please be ready to start paddling at 1:00 PM and be prepared to keep a moderate pace while paddling.  Even though the scenery is beautiful it can be enjoyed by keeping a pace that will allow us to explore lots of the area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nancy H</member_name><member_id>7962459</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289047621000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285196564000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tully Lake, Royalston, MA</name><id>14863921</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286038800000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/14863921/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
