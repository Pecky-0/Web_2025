<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Kids, I am moving the date on this because Barbara lives across the street and wants to have us all over after hiking for pot luck and fun.  Please check your availability and change the response if needed.  I will have some thing else up for the 13th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a beautiful area that starts in Durham and will end in Madison.  We will have to spot cars on this one since we are thru hiking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is a thru hike in Durham.  We will meet at the parking area for the Rockland Preserve on rt. 79 in Madison at 9:30 a.m..  There is plenty of parking at that location.  We will shuttle folks up to the starting point on Pisgah Rd.  This hike has ups and downs with lots of rocks and beautiful views along the cliffs.  We will pass the Pyramid which is a huge glacial anomaly and Selectman's Stones that marks the Durham, Madison, and Guilford boarders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is no more than 6 miles.  We will start the hike at 10:00 and should finish no later than 2:30.  You need hiking boots, water, layers appropriate for the winter(no cotton) and snacks.  I strongly recommend traction devices for this hike.  Our pick is microspikes.  We have seen a lot of ice this season.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking location which is where we will end. &lt;br /&gt;Rockland Preserve Parking area is across from Samantha Court on Route 79 in Madison, CT.  The sign is set back a bit.  You will need to pay attention for the entrance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Madison&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=%5B1-99%5D+Samantha+Ln&amp;amp;zipcode=06443&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.42345&amp;amp;longitude=-72.65075&amp;amp;geocode=STREET" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the APPROXIMATE location of the start of the hike.
