&lt;p&gt;It is showing in the downstairs IMAX theater.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This makes things confusing as do things differently every time they show a movie down here.&amp;nbsp; I will be waiting outside the ropes until they let us inside.&amp;nbsp; Then I will either be waiting by the concession stand till 6:30 when the group will go in for seats, or standing in line on the inner lobby, if they decide to do that for this movie.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group before the movie.&amp;nbsp; We will gather in the hallway outside auditorium 2 after the movie to discuss the movie for a bit, allow for restroom breaks and getting a head count for going to a nearby establisment for drinks and munchies and lively conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3D action-thriller "Sanctum," from executive producer James Cameron, follows a team of underwater cave divers on a treacherous expedition to the largest, most beautiful and least accessible cave system on Earth. When a tropical storm forces them deep into the caverns, they must fight raging water, deadly terrain and creeping panic as they search for an unknown escape route to the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master diver Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) has explored the South Pacific's Esa-ala Caves for months. But when his exit is cut off in a flash flood, Frank's team--including 17-year-old son Josh (Rhys Wakefield) and financier Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffudd)--are forced to radically alter plans. With dwindling supplies, the crew must navigate an underwater labyrinth to make it out. Soon, they are confronted with the unavoidable question: Can they survive, or will they be trapped forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shot on location off the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, "Sanctum" employs 3D photography techniques Cameron developed to lens "Avatar." Designed to operate in extreme environments, the technology used to shoot the action-thriller will bring audiences on a breathless journey across plunging cliffs and into the furthest reaches of our subterranean world.&lt;/p&gt;
