They would run for 45 min. and would cost $15.00 each person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a certified Total Immersion swim coach and without her help I would have never gotten through my first tri. (I was a total noob to swimming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can do June 21st, June 28th and July 12th at 7:30 AM at Walden pond. (for directions: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/walden/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/walden/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimum of 4 people and a max of 10.  If there's enough interest we'll try to do all 3 dates. I'm going to have to say it's a first come first serve basis, and if the clinics fill up we'll have to somehow regulate that a person can only partake in one clinic so everyone gets their fair share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about Katherine here:&lt;br /&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.munchkinmovement.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.munchkinmovement.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.munchkinmo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bigdreamsf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is well received! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's to happy confident open-water swimming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Rebecca&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My old swim coach from TNT, Katherine Schwab (a certified total immersion swim instructor) will be coaching the clinic.
