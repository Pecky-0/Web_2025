This class gives an overview of what Christian Mysticism is and what mystics do, and, most importantly, it offers participants a chance to experience the spiritual world first-hand.  Open to all, there is no restriction on faith.  You only have to believe that there is most likely a power of intelligence that is higher than human intelligence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244850190000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243299201000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Boston Christian Mysticism Meetup</name><id>10490837</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244392200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/10490837/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/1/global_622209.jpeg</photo_url></item>
