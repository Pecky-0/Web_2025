Its not a big meal or getting drunk party so younger family members are invited too.&lt;br /&gt;Those who dont drink can bring sparkling something..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From all the past simmilar events, this location has some special plusses...we can walk to the top or some can drive to the top..but don't you want to work a bit for a reward ??
