Where we will Discover YOUR PERSONAL Recipe for Success!&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What exactly is MY PERSONAL Recipe for Success?&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOUR PERSONAL Recipe for Success is a combination of your own unique needs &amp;amp; wants, aka 'individual' ingredients combined with many 'foundational' success ingredients.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that there are 'individual' as well as 'foundational' ingredients that need to be in place for you to reach your ultimate happiness &amp;amp; success.  To become successful we have to take the time to find our unique values, talents, interests &amp;amp; wants and combine it with numerous foundational type success ingredients.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHY it WORKS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words hold more meaning and energy than simply the dictionary. The words we use, can give us clues on how/where to take the direction of our lives, help boost our self-esteem &amp;amp; increase our overall happiness.   &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Fresh off the release of my 'Life Recipe for Success' Audio Series where I raise awareness to certain 'foundational' success ingredients these events are geared towards helping you find your 'individual' success ingredients.  Combine the two and vvwwalllaa...you have YOUR PERSONAL Recipe for Success!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening will be worth its weight in gold as it was ONE of THE MOST influential pieces I've ever done to help guide myself in the direction of where I wanted to take my life.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come find out YOUR PERSONAL recipe for success...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will facilitate &amp;amp; guide the evening, please come open minded-relaxed and ready for fun...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00-6:30pm Appetizer Mix n Mingle  &lt;br /&gt;6:30-7:00pm Intros &amp;amp; exercises  &lt;br /&gt;7:00-8:00pm Recap- Open Discussion  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much love n light!  &lt;br /&gt;Dani Lynn  &lt;br /&gt;Radio Host~Life Coach~Motivational Speaker  &lt;br /&gt;www.liferecipeforsuccess.com   &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Mention C&amp;C</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Danielle Lucido</member_name><member_id>8800487</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274372982000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Personal Growth Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cocktails-Conversations</urlname><id>1372859</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>Cocktails &amp; Conversations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273085243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discover YOUR PERSONAL Recipe for Success!!</name><id>13395130</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274306400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cocktails-Conversations/events/13395130/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/2/4/global_14852340.jpeg</photo_url></item>
