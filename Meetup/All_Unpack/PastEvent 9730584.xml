Laughter Yoga is the practice of using laughter as a tool to experience better physical and mental well-being.  Our brains do not know the difference between real laughter and fake laughter, so by practicing laughter for a sustained period of time you get all the same benefits of really laughing(and well, that usually happens too!)  And did we mention, you will burn between 350-500 calories doing it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Join us for a fun and energizing hour of levity and laughter!  &lt;br /&gt;Cost $15  (FREE if it is your first time at the Landing Center)&lt;br /&gt;Come as you are. No mat needed.&lt;br /&gt;contact: katie@katiewestlifedesign.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236379435000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Laugh with Maine Laughter Yoga</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Maine-Laughter-Yoga</urlname><id>1336948</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Maine Laughter Yoga Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234472125000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INTRODUCTION TO LAUGHTER YOGA</name><id>9730584</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235331000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Maine-Laughter-Yoga/events/9730584/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/f/global_7285791.jpeg</photo_url></item>
