&lt;p&gt;The ski house is set up hostel style with most bedrooms containing 2 bunk beds.  We have comfy common areas including a living room with fireplace, commercial size kitchen (prepare your own foods, no meal plan this weekend) and large entertainment space.  Cost is $25 per night, per person  - $15 cancellation fee applies.  If possible try to stay both Friday and Saturday, we will have some apres options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do a Meet &amp;amp; Greet on Friday starting at 8pm but feel free to arrive anytime before midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house is located in the town of Bartlett NH, just north or the North Conway town line, full directions will be emailed to all that sign up to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
