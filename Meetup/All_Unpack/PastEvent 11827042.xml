Since the December meeting was cancelled, we need to elect officers for 2010, choose a scholarship chair and committee, and make plans for an anniversary celebration in February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come with your ideas for fun things you'd like to do in the coming months and a dish to share!  Please post what you will be bringing to help ensure a well-rounded menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this event is in a private home, you must RSVP to get directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263167010000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257718817000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a meeting</name><id>11827042</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262993400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/11827042/</event_url></item>
