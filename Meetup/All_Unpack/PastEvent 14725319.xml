This Sunday it's Parker and Amadee plus Evan Goodrow, Tom West,  Danny Heath, and Steve Bankuti.  They start early on Sunday nights so that you can enjoy and still make it home reasonably early for work on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover charge is either $5 or $7 depending on the number of artist/musicians playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.thegrog.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thegrog.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grog is located in the heart of historic downtown Newburyport - just a half block from Market Square.&lt;br /&gt;13 Middle Street, Newburyport, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is usually easy to find just down the street and occasionally in their small parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for fun, some history on the Grog:&lt;br /&gt;After returning from The Civil War, Alfred W. Thompson, the great-grandfather of Newburyport Yankee Whit Kimball, opened a &amp;quot;Ladies and Gents Eating and Oyster House&amp;quot; serving Newburyporters, sailors, statesmen and travelers until prohibition.  After repeal, Spud Leary opened the Pilot House, serving the public until 1964, when the McCarthys assumed stewardship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1969 the business was rechristened &amp;quot;The Grog&amp;quot; after the English Navy's traditional ration of rum and water.  This tradition was started by Admiral Vernon, whose nickname was &amp;quot;Old Grog&amp;quot;, so called for the cloak he wore made of grogram.  We continue to salute you, Admiral Vernon!&lt;a href="http://www.thegrog.com" target="_blank"&gt;The Grog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tall strawberry blonde ready to dance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gretchen</member_name><member_id>3330386</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284424804000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Good Timers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WhatsAngeloDoing-com</urlname><id>1403921</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>WhatsAngeloDoing.com</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284141537000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blues at The Grog in Newburyport</name><id>14725319</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284332400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WhatsAngeloDoing-com/events/14725319/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/9/b/global_17842763.jpeg</photo_url></item>
