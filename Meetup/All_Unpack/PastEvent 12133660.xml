We will have several club members staying this week.  The house is located  just north on North Conway so it is within 20 minutes of Wildcat, attiatsh, Black and Cranmore Ski areas.  Usually I use this week to get in shape for the season with winter hikes or snowboarding everyday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start off with a small crew of people (maybe 10) on the 26th and add more until we have a full house for New Years.  Come and see the club during its quiet and busy times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only $20 a night, bring your own bedding, 21 + only&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262038100000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261517247000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Week at Wedelns</name><id>12133660</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261864800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/12133660/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/7/global_11666887.jpeg</photo_url></item>
