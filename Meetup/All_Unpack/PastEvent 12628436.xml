Interested in carpooling, I have room for 2 passengers with skiis and am also just around the corner from the N.Billerica commuter rail T station for those with no car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* no rentals on site, but X-C ski and snowshoe rentals are available just down the road at Village Sports at 394 Main St. across from town green in New London (603-526-4948). &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>khaki/tan Jeep Compass, MA plates</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Debra S</member_name><member_id>4793319</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267059802000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266426517000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pine Hill XC Ski and Pancakes</name><id>12628436</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266679800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/12628436/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/3/global_13167603.jpeg</photo_url></item>
