Roger will be hosting this very first event in the Plymouth area. Got5minutes.com has been hosting these events for 7 years in CT and has just moved into the Boston area. Two important things to keep in mind! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

1. You must register for this event at www.got5minutes.com and don't wait too long as these events fill up fast. The website will give you so much more information so take a look today. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

2. Got5minutes.com recruits from many other venues including their own meetup called south shore singles looking for a match. Soooo the RSVP list on this site is only a fraction of those attending! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please join us as you will have a blast! And register today to be sure you get a spot!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we are in the private room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jaimy</member_name><member_id>9380509</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330565703000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Night Lifers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonnights</urlname><id>860845</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Nights</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328664376000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Singles ages 31-49</name><id>51480282</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330560000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonnights/events/51480282/</event_url></item>
