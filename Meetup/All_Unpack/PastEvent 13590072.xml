In them you'll find: one forty-five caliber automatic; two boxes of ammunition; four days' concentrated emergency rations; one drug issue containing antibiotics, morphine, vitamin pills, pep pills, sleeping pills, tranquilizer pills; one miniature combination Russian phrase book and Bible; one hundred dollars in rubles; one hundred dollars in gold; nine packs of chewing gum; one issue of prophylactics; three lipsticks; three pair of nylon stockings. Shoot, a fella' could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of Vegas, we’re only going as far as Davis Square. Due to MA State gun laws, Glenn Beck’s alleged cornering of the gold market, and a dearth of ruble exchangers, we’ll also be short a few items. We will make up for it with a heap of writing exercises that should keep us going until 8:30 or so.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>3324571</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277991515000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274803700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Survival Kits for Writers</name><id>13590072</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277852400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/13590072/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
