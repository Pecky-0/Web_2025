The probe emits a message delivered in the song of long-extinct humpback whales. Unless the call can be answered, Earth faces certain destruction. So Admiral Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the former Enterprise crew time travel to 1986 San Francisco to find humpback whales and bring them back to the future, in the hope that they can persuade the probe to stop its attacks. Before the film, marine biologist Dave Wiley, Research Coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency's Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, shares new insights into the amazing underwater lives of humpback whales based on new technologies.
