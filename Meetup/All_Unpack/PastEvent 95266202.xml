 If you haven't heard of this global yet unpronounceable phenomenon, Pecha Kucha is a monthly format for sharing ideas, in which presenters are allotted 20 slides and 20 seconds per slide. Put simply: 6 minutes and 40 seconds of adult-style show &amp;amp; tell. It began in Tokyo in 2003, has since spread to over 463 cities worldwide, and first landed in Providence in March of 09. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ***Doors open at 7:20, presentations start at 8:20, and schmoozing goes down throughout.***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>This is posted as an FYI (For Your Information) - I will probably be going wearing some kind of scarf.
