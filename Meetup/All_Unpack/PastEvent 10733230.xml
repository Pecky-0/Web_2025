<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Looking for people to join me in a relaxed 8 mile run along the Charles Saturday morning. The run starts at Panera Bread on Arsenal Street in Watertown, and continues onto the path along the Charles river. I run at a 9 to 9 1/2 minute mile pace, but can certainly try to go faster or slower to accommodate other running speeds. The weather on Saturday is supposed to be nice in the morning, and then lousy in the afternoon, so if you are hoping to squeeze in a run at some point on Saturday, you'd be wise to run in the morning.... with me ;) Though I've scheduled the past 2 runs at this location, I am TOTALLY open to scheduling the next one somewhere else (please feel free to send me suggestions for locations). I hope to see a bunch of you there on Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Panera Bread at Arsenal on the Charles</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>heidi</member_name><member_id>8485896</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246281075000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245938162000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Morning Run Along the Charles- 8 Miles</name><id>10733230</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246107600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10733230/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
