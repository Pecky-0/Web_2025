We'll pass through field, forest, and nice evergreen forest with views of the reservoir about half way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot at 2:45 PM. We'll hike from the parking lot and take the following trails or portions of trails: Bookside, Open Forest, Triassic, Rainbow Reservoir, Wetland Forest, and back to the parking lot. Children and leashed dogs are welcome. The hike will take about 2.25 hours and be done by about 5 PM at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear something waterproof for potential mud on the trail. Hiking boots would be great. Also, bring some water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;* From Interstate 91 heading north, take Exit 38.
