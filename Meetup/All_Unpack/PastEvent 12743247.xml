Together with the existing Wiesner Building (designed by MIT alumnus I. M. Pei), the complex will serve as a showplace for new concepts in design, communications systems, and collaborative research. The goal is to ignite a new energy and connectivity within the two-building complex, and then extend this energy beyond our walls—to our sponsors and to the world at large&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Fumihiko Maki:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://architect.architecture.sk/fumihiko-maki-architect/fumihiko-maki-architect.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://architect.arch...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A major figure in Japanese architecture since the late 1950s, Fumihiko Maki is recognized for his architectural and urban design work as well as his contributions to architectural theory. Fumihiko Maki's work is characterized by his critical development of the modern model, his desire to create a contemporary urban architecture and spaces of public appearance, and his attempt to fuse design concepts of the Hast and West. Fumihiko Maki is known for Fumihiko Maki's rational approach, intelligent combination of technology with craftsmanship, and delicate details, all of which are illustrated in projects for cultural, residential, commercial, educational as well as office, convention, and sports facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] A recurring aspect in Fumihiko Maki's designs is his masterful use of light, a quality that is further developed in Fumihiko Maki's works of the 1990s. The Graduate School Research Center (1994) at Keio University's Shonan Fujisawa Campus is characterized by its transparent entrance wall and the brise-soleil of perforated aluminum panels. The Tokyo Church of Christ (1995) features a shop-like translucent wall of light in the main hall, separating the building from the chaotic surrounding and providing a place for spiritual reflection&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the MIT Media Lab:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The MIT Media Lab (also known as the Media Lab) is a department within the MIT School of Architecture and Planning. Devoted to research projects at the convergence of multimedia and technology, the Media Lab was widely popularized in the 1990s by business and technology publications such as Wired and Red Herring for a series of practical inventions in the fields of wireless networks, field sensing, web browsers and the World Wide Web. More recently it has focused on product design more generally, particularly for technologies that address social causes.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] The MIT Media Lab was founded by MIT Professor Nicholas Negroponte and former MIT President Jerome Wiesner (now deceased) and opened its doors in the Wiesner Building (designed by I.M. Pei), or the E15 building at MIT in 1985. It grew out of the work of MIT’s Architecture Machine Group, and remains within MIT School of Architecture and Planning&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Nicholas Negroponte:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.media.mit....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Nicholas is founder and chairman of the One Laptop per Child non-profit association. He is currently on leave from MIT, where he was co-founder and director of the MIT Media Laboratory, and the Jerome B. Wiesner Professor of Media Technology. A graduate of MIT, Nicholas was a pioneer in the field of computer-aided design, and has been a member of the MIT faculty since 1966. Conceived in 1980, the Media Laboratory opened its doors in 1985. He is also author of the 1995 best seller, Being Digital, which has been translated into more than 40 languages. In the private sector, Nicholas serves on the board of directors for Motorola, Inc. and as general partner in a venture capital firm specializing in digital technologies for information and entertainment. He has provided start-up funds for more than 40 companies, including Wired magazine&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MIT News: Maki building launches new era for MIT Media Lab&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;September 26, 2006&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/media-lab-building.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.mit.edu/ne...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;MIT announced today that it will break ground in spring 2007 for a new Media Lab designed by Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki. The expansion marks a new era of innovation for the Media Lab, which has become legendary for inventions that have ignited the digital revolution, are redefining the potential for creative expression, and, in the future, will push the boundaries of human augmentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This milestone signals MIT's commitment to expanding the highly interdisciplinary, often unconventional research that has become the Media Lab's trademark. The 163,000-square-foot, six-story building will feature an open, atelier-style, adaptable architecture specifically designed to provide the flexibility to respond to emerging research priorities. High levels of transparency throughout the building's interior will make ongoing research visible, encouraging connections and collaboration among researchers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] Frank Moss, director of the Media Lab, hails the Maki-designed building as an exceptional environment for advancing the lab's unique brand of creativity and research. 'An essential ingredient in the lab's distinctive approach to &amp;quot;open innovation&amp;quot; has been its exploitation of open physical spaces,' says Moss. 'The abundance of such spaces in the new building will be a perfect setting for expanding our research agenda into exciting new realms such as robots that learn from people, and bionics, for taking ideas beyond the demo stage to working prototypes, and finally for strengthening our ties with corporate sponsors.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; 'I am thrilled to see a signature Maki building going up on the MIT campus, and especially pleased that it will be associated with our school,' says AdÌ¬le NaudÌ© Santos, dean of MIT's School of Architecture and Planning, which includes the Media Lab. 'Fumihiko Maki is known for spatially inventive, beautifully proportioned buildings where every detail is carefully designed. His work has a timeless elegance and durability that will be very appropriate for this campus. The sequence of spatially connected labs and atria will foster the synergetic, collective research and teaching activities that are redefining the relationship between design and technology to improve the quality of human lives and the societies in which we live.'&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fumihiko Maki Designs MIT Media Lab Building&lt;/b&gt;, Pritzker Prize Architect Creates Style For Substance&lt;br /&gt;By Mark Favermann - 2010-01-27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://berkshirefinearts.com/?page=article&amp;amp;article_id=1423&amp;amp;catID=26" target="_blank"&gt;http://berkshirefinea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] The now famous MIT Media Lab is a department within the School of Architecture and Planning at MIT. It is devoted to research projects at the convergence of multimedia and technology. It was popularized by business and technology publications and the general media during the cyber-friendlier 1990s.
