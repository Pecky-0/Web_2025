 &lt;br /&gt;

 As you can imagine, it's chaotic, with a lot of scripts "finished" at 3am.  And then executed by cast &amp;amp; crew operating mostly on adrenaline and caffeine (in my case, 14hrs of filming after 5hrs of sleep...&amp;amp; the rest of my team had it WORSE!).  You will see some pretty creative films, inspired films, funny films...you will also see unfinished films, films that make no sense (or only partial sense), and films with huge errors in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

MY FILM: A somewhat surreal film, "Trollstoy" (as in Tolstoy).  I haven't seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 TICKETS: There are 2 blocks of shorts that night.  Group A (the one I'm in) is from 7pm to about 9pm, then a break, then Group B at 9:30pm.  $10 for Group A, or $15 for A &amp;amp; B.  I'm going to both.  I plan to show up early, and can hang-out after too.  These things can sell-out...to buy in advance, go to &lt;br /&gt;
