This 30-acre tract of natural, undeveloped land adjoins the Kennard Park and Conservation Areas in Newton and the State¹s thirty acre Lost Pond Reservation. Together, these properties contain over one hundred acres of open woodland, rocky outcrops, marsh, bog and stream. Anetwork of trails interconnects these conservation properties. Lost Pond, one of the few natural ponds remaining in Brookline, is a ³kettle hole² pond, formed around a mass of ice left by glacial activity about 17,000 years ago. Aquaking peat bog developed on its northern edge. The Lost Pond Reservation, owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, property lies adjacent to Lost Pond Conservation Area. The pond is located on the reservation property. The sanctuary is used for wetland protection, conservation of wildlife habitat, environmental education, and passive exploration, such as bird-watching and nature walks.&lt;/p&gt;
