Karim Nagi re-imagines the Arab tradition, performing acrobatic sufi drumming, Saidi cane dances, and soulful buzuq taqasim, all within a greater story. But this is not a simple cultural showcase. Karim, through futuristic remixing, animated oration, and the mashing of Arab and famous Western songs, a unique theatrical experience is made. He will perform his original works including the melodic &amp;#147;Flying Heavy for Egypt&amp;#148;, the percussive opus &amp;#147;Ya Haggar&amp;#148;, his dance choreography of &amp;#147;Al-Harb Ma&amp;#146; Al-Rouah&amp;#148; and his finger cymbal a cappella &amp;#147;Cymbalisms&amp;#148;. Nagi will also perform songs from his newest CD &amp;#147;ARABIZED&amp;#148; which includes Arabic versions of famous songs by Mozart, Rossini, and Latino and Asian traditions. &lt;a href="https://centerforarabicculture.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/210-karim-nagi-presents-arabized/" target="_blank"&gt;https://centerforarab...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>noor</member_name><member_id>10226354</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1328927235000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Arabic Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonArabic</urlname><id>1143990</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Area Arabic Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326829883000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ARABIZED featuring Karim Nagi  </name><id>48487692</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328922000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonArabic/events/48487692/</event_url></item>
