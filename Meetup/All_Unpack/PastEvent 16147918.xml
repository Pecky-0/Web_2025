&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different bar scenes in New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;02/14/2011's location will be:  &lt;br /&gt;Richter's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008080"&gt;Richter's is a New Haven icon, with &lt;a href="http://richters.homestead.com/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; dating back to 1911. If you've never been there, its a cozy, warm establishment with a beautifully detailed wood bar. (Ok, I didn't quite explain that right - look at the picture.  It's lovely.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's their beer description from their &lt;a href="http://richters.homestead.com/" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;: "Here at Richters we have 13 beers on draft and 25 beers available in a bottle. Our draft beer in available in three sizes: a half pint, a pint and of course our signature half yard. Yep, 32ounces of beer in an 18 inch glass. Our bottled beer is available in ... well, a bottle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;Specials:  &lt;br /&gt;Speaking of their half yards, Monday's they have $5 half yards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;The owner, Dieter was also kind enough to give us $4 house drinks.  (I explained that while the half yards are both a great deal and look cool, people like me who aren't exactly.. coordinated enough to drink out of a glass that's 18" tall need a special too!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They always have $2 PBRs and Miller Lights : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUY TWO APPS GET ONE FREE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please RSVP for this event as soon as you know so that I can give them an accurate heads up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Happy Hour Events if you're only a "Maybe" please put this in your comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your host is Devorah, # in RSVP.  Richters has a very narrow bar area, we will probably be in the dining room.  Give me a ring if you don't see us when you arrive!  The bartender will also know where we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
