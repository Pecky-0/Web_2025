The owner's play a nice mix of music from the 70's and 80's. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesdays they offer $5.00 Stoli Drinks along with $5.00 small plates...though there is nothing small about them!!! Their Crabmeat Stuffed Mushrooms are to die for as are the Gourmet Nachos covered in Italian sausage, Gorgonzola, mozzarella, cheddar, and hot peppers; Spicy Peel and Eat shrimp,three different types of wings, I could go and on...enough to say that the food and drink are great! The atmosphere delightful and the owners attentive and fun!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the Saloon.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271458095000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
