<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:  We will meet at Renee &amp;amp; Kenny's house and carpool and then meet there afterwards for lunch. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nhliberty.org/" target="_blank"&gt;NHLA&lt;/a&gt; participates in the NH Adopt A Highway program and has a section of road on Route 4 that they sponsor.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be to simply pick up trash along the section of road that they sponsor.  NH DOT will provide the bags, signs and pretty orange vests (sorry we must return them when we are done!) for the cleanup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this activity will be occurring on a major road, this is not a kid friendly event, and the state does have a age requirement (I believe it's 12 but can double check).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we will have a lunch at Renee's house for those that helped with the clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanup that we did in June resulted in 27 bags of trash and took about 2 hours.  We did run into plenty of snakes therefore I would recommend that you wear boots.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at Renee's house and carpool to location</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223903238000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218860225000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHLA Roadside Pick-Up</name><id>8555422</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223730000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/8555422/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/a/global_3188554.jpeg</photo_url></item>
