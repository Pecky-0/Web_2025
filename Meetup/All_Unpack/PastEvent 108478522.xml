&lt;p&gt;Eating with the Ecosystem is a place-based approach to sustainable seafood for New England. By fusing the ecological knowledge of marine scientists and commercial fishermen with the culinary creativity of the region’s most innovative chefs, the project advances a dining paradigm that channels a deep understanding of the special places in the ocean that produce the seafood we enjoy. Eating with the Ecosystem’s traveling dinner series partners with restaurants in Rhode Island and the Boston area to celebrate and steward the region's unique marine ecosystems, one at a time: Southern New England waters, Georges Bank, and the Gulf of Maine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366164100000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Urban-Homesteaders-League</urlname><id>1466080</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Urban Homesteaders' League</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362875579000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eating with the Ecosystem sustainable seafood dinner</name><id>108478522</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>16200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366147800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Urban-Homesteaders-League/events/108478522/</event_url></item>
