<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Come join a bunch of your fellow gaming geeks on a trip to King Richard's Faire in Carver MA. See the Mud Show, jousting, and a real, live Liger. Eat overpriced medival-themed food (there was no silverware, but there was pepsi?). Bond with other nerds and maybe meet some folks you want to game with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll all meet at my house at 11am, cram as many people into as few cars as possible and head out there. Tickets to the Faire are about $25, and you should budget at least another $20 for food and tips (many of the performers only get paid by passing the hat). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://kingrichardsfaire.net/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://kingrichardsfaire.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://kingrichardsfa...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159919756000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1155913360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>King Richard's Faire</name><id>5084461</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158505200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/5084461/</event_url></item>
