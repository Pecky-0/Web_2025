After all we say &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; many times each day. Isn't this gratitude? Yes, it is... in a small way. However, gratitude can be a much larger element of your life. In fact, gratitude can actually generate the power to move mountains. Why is this so? And what if you are too mad about what your life has been like to feel gratitude? This seminar will help you understand not only what large-scale gratitude is but also how to move from resentment and anger into the healing power of feeling grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seminar is being given by Mother Clare Watts. Mother Clare is the Co-Director of the Order of Christ Sophia, a Master Teacher, ordained Priest, midwife, marriage and family therapist, nationally renowned speaker, and author of &amp;quot;Giving Birth to God: A Woman's Path to Enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
