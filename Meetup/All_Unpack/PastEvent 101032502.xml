&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that comedian Eddie Izzard will accept the 6th Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism -- an award presented at Harvard University each year by the Humanist Community at Harvard, the American Humanist Association, and the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous recipients have included: novelist Sir Salman Rushdie, punk rock star and biologist Greg Graffin, writer/director Joss Whedon, TV debunkers Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman (of the hit show Mythbusters), humorist Stephen Fry, and author Mary Roach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Held in Harvard’s Memorial Church, a historic building in the center of the campus yard, the award ceremony honors an individual whom we feel has made a superlative contribution to Humanism in world culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his humor, Eddie Izzard’s political activism, charity work, and support for education reminds us all that the nonreligious can be outstanding members of global society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for this celebration, performance, and opportunity to ask questions!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361485076000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1358968374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eddie Izzard to receive award for Lifetime Achievement in Cultural Humanism</name><id>101032502</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361408400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/101032502/</event_url></item>
