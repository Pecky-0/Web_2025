Want to talk about it and how it has changed your life? Or you can listen to the stories of others who have also had spiritual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our group is informal, and we like to provide a safe, nurturing environment where you can feel comfortable sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can explore the more common types of spiritual experiences such as dreams, visions, and feelings of divine love. Or delve into the more unusual ones like Soul Travel.&amp;nbsp; We also like to share techniques for gaining a greater understanding of your experience, how to ask God/Spirit/life/the Universe a question and how to find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be upstairs in the king's daughter's room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jamie Fairley</member_name><member_id>12983085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318072000000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group</urlname><id>1551111</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Central Connecticut Spiritual Experiences Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317161670000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spiritual Experiences</name><id>35222772</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317942000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group/events/35222772/</event_url></item>
