May 5th is Cinco de Mayo, The day of the dead in Mexico or someplace, I'd rather it be the day of the alive, and kinda healthy, so I've sheduled a meetup from Warren,R.I. into and around Colt State Park, it should be a ride round trip ofÂ  about 14 miles, if weather is nice, we can continue riding further north if you want. Hopefully weather will co-operate, bring your freinds if you want to, and all group members just show up even if you haven't rsvp'd. I'll update Thur. as to weather conditions,hope to see a bunch of you awesome people there!
