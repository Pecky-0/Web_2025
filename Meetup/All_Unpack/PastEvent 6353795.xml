While this event will be open to the public it has been planned just for US!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please spread the word to all of your friends in other singles meetup groups, everyone is welcome! The third floor is where many of us saw Spreadeagles. There is a bar, dance floor and pool tables along with plenty of tables and chairs. We are of course also welcome to use the second floor if you want to go down and ride the bull, watch the tv... whatever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brewery charges a $5.00 cover charge to go up to the 2nd and 3rd floor. But if you come earlier for dinner they let you up without the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you reply:&lt;br /&gt;Please state yes for dinner and HOW MANY or no for dinner (at 7:30), we will need a reservation if a large crowd.&lt;br /&gt;If just coming for dancing please state how many friends you are bringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is a success the promoter may consider doing it with us every month! Yahoo, our own party place! :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193009766000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189718819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SUPER SINGLES MEETUP EVENT!!!</name><id>6353795</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192836600000</time><rsvp_limit>150</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/6353795/</event_url></item>
