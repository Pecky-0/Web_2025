On the serious side we can talk about when to golf and where to golf. It would be good to know E-Mail and cell phone numbers so members can get in touch on short notice to golf. On the lighter side we can play some Wii golf and get to know each other. This will be BYOB. so bring your beverage of choice. There will be snacks and pizza. This will be a great opportunity to meet the other members of the group so try to come by even if its only to say hello. The address is   &lt;br /&gt;          21 Marty Lane  &lt;br /&gt;          South Windsor, Ct 06074  &lt;br /&gt;          860 508-2801   &lt;br /&gt;I will post directions   &lt;br /&gt;                                                       Hope to see you there  &lt;br /&gt;                                                           Mark  &lt;br /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6395701</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269904382000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CentralCTGolf</urlname><id>1040754</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7699966431</group_lon><name>The Central CT  Golf Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269222482000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Golf Social Get together Play WII golf</name><id>12951452</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269730800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CentralCTGolf/events/12951452/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/f/global_4279471.jpeg</photo_url></item>
