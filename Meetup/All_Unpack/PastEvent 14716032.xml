It joins the old route of the trail at the edge of the Ammonoosuc River after a slight ascent. (The lower section of the old route, marked by a sign, leads left from here to the Base Station.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;entering alpine zone &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; hike 2.10 mi/2 hr 9 min/+2157 ft on the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The main trail bears right along the river, following the old route for the rest of the way. It ascends mostly by easy grades, though with some rough footing, crossing Monroe Brook and the outlet of Gem Pool, a beautiful emerald pool at the foot of a cascade.&lt;br /&gt;Now the very steep, rough ascent begins. A side path leads right about 80 yd. to a spectacular viewpoint at the foot of the gorge. Above this point, the main brook falls about 600 ft. down a steep trough in the mountainside at an average angle of 45 degrees, while another brook a short distance to the north does the same, and these two spectacular water slides meet in a pool at the foot of the gorge. The main trail continues its steep ascent, passes an outlook over the cascades to the right of the trail and crosses the main brook on flat ledges at the head of the highest fall, a striking viewpoint. The grade now begins to ease, and the trail crosses several more brooks. Ledges become more frequent and the scrub becomes smaller and more sparse. The trail emerges from the scrub and follows a line of cairns directly up some rock slabs (which are slippery when wet), passes through one last patch of scrub, and reaches the Crawford Path at the south side of Lakes of the Clouds Hut. &lt;br /&gt; to AMC Lakes of the Clouds Hut &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; hike 0.10 mi/3 min/+45 ft on the Crawford Path&lt;/b&gt; The Crawford Path now climbs up to the base of Mt. Monroe, where the north end of the Mt. Monroe Loop diverges right to cross both summits of Monroe, affording excellent views. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to the junction of Mt Monroe Loop&lt;/b&gt;  hike 0.30 mi/9 min/+291 ft on the Mt Monroe Loop. From the Crawford Path the Mt. Monroe Loop rises sharply, then follows the northeast shoulder to the summit of Mt. Monroe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 3.50 mi  Time 3 hr 4 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2954 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -89 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +2864 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The trail descends from the summit of Mt. Monroe and reaches a shallow, grassy sag. It continues as it ascends the minor crag called Little Monroe before reaching Crawford Path. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Crawford Path &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Crawford Path continues along the edge of the precipice that forms the northwest wall of Oakes Gulf, the Mt. Monroe Loop rejoins on the right, and the main path continues along the flat ridge, passing an unmarked path on the left that leads in 130 yd. to the barely noticeable summit of Mt. Franklin, from which there are excellent views, particularly into Oakes Gulf. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail drops rather steeply off the end of the shoulder, then descends moderately to the sag, passing the Mt. Eisenhower Trail. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;to the junction of Mt Eisenhower Trail hike&lt;/b&gt; 0.20 mi/8 min/-24 ft on the Crawford Path &lt;br /&gt; The Mt. Eisenhower Loop leaves on the right on a small ledge overlooking Red Pond, a small alpine tarn of stagnant water. The Edmands Path can be reached from this junction by following the Mt. Eisenhower Loop for a short distance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;to the junction of Mt Eisenhower Loop hike&lt;/b&gt; 0.02 mi/1 min/-5 ft on the Mt Eisenhower Loop &lt;br /&gt; From the Crawford Path, it descends briefly to a junction on the right with the Edmands Path. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Edmands Path &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;hike 0.38 mi/11 min/+330 ft on the Mt Eisenhower Loop&lt;/b&gt;  It passes through a grassy sag just to the right of Red Pond and then ascends moderately from a ledge overlooking Red Pond. &lt;br /&gt; to Mt Eisenhower &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 5.70 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 4 hr 43 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +3462 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -1198 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +2265 ft &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From there, it descends moderately to a ledge overlooking Red Pond, then drops steeply over ledges, passes through a grassy sag just to the left of Red Pond. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Edmands Path &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;hike 2.90 mi/2 hr 42 min/-2405 ft on the Edmands Path&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; From the Mt. Eisenhower Loop, a few yards from the Crawford Path, the Edmands Path crosses the nose of a ridge on a footway paved with carefully placed stones. It then enters the scrub and contours around the north slope of Mt. Eisenhower at a nearly level grade, affording excellent views through a fringe of trees. It crosses a small brook running over a ledge and descends to pass through a small stone gateway. It swings right and angles down the mountainside on a footway supported by extensive rock cribbing. It descends steadily, undulating down the west ridge of Mt. Eisenhower, carefully searching out the most comfortable grades. After a long descent, the trail crosses a wet area and merges right with an old logging road. It turns sharp left to cross Abenaki Brook on a bridge and runs nearly level across two small brooks to the Edmands Path Trailhead &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 8.98 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 7 hr 36 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +3554 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -4024 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change -470 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://local.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;daddr=44.267002,-71.360824(Ammonoosuc+Ravine+Trailhead)" target="_blank"&gt;Driving Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;DISCLAIMER (SHAMELESSLY PLAGERIZED FROM ANOTHER MEETUP HIKER): MY ROLE AS ORGANIZER IN THIS HIKE IS SOCIAL.
