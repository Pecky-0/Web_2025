With the release of “911 Ripple Effect” comes new information and analyses put forth by noted eyewitnesses, former military, pilots and independent researchers.  As more and more people are realizing the inconsistencies in the media version of the happenings on September 11, 2001, William Lewis and Dave vonKleist, the documentary’s producers, fervently hope to light a proverbial fire under the population so that they will rise up and demand a new, independent investigation both for the victims of September 11th, but most importantly for the survivors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;With the use of on-the-street interviews&lt;/b&gt;, each segment is introduced as citizens of “Any town USA” tell what they heard and saw as that catastrophic day in our history unfolded.  You know the stories, but what did we REALLY see?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“911 Ripple Effect”&lt;/b&gt; presents evidence and information about images shown to the world that were described to us by the media, but the twist is, these very images do not support the “official” story the media and government continue to tell.  Even these stories have changed to fit the terrorist-riddled version of tragedy in the United States.  VonKleist and Lewis provide some fairly damning reports, especially by Pentagon Correspondent Jamie McIntyre of CNN, Marc Birnbach of FOX News, and a reporter for the BBC, that are in direct conflict with the “official” versions.  McIntyre, nearly five years later, is heard trying to explain away statements he made during live, first coverage broadcasts, Birnbach disappeared from FOX News for several years, and has now returned, and the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s&amp;amp;feature=related" target="_blank"&gt;BBC reported the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 nearly twenty minutes earlier than the actual collapse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short subjects&lt;/b&gt; - bring what you think others should see - we'll see what shorts we have time to view. We also have the capability to show You Tube and Google videos, so bring your links.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: &lt;b&gt;1st Tuesday-Nashua&lt;/b&gt;; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord; 4th Tuesday- Bristol (our new northern location). If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, maybe we'll have a Truth Party somewhere!&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at 7:00 PM&lt;/b&gt;, since this meeting is on a tight schedule. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and the video will begin promptly at 7:30.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring healthy snacks&lt;/b&gt; and/or drinks for sharing, since some may have come to our meeting directly from work. Contributing a box of tea is always a good idea to build an inventory of available beverages!&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking is in the lot in front of the building&lt;/b&gt;. Please enter the right entry doorway and suite 135 will be directly ahead of you. After entering the office, turn left to go to the video viewing room.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newspaper&lt;/b&gt; - For an interesting paper which covers 9/11 Truth issues and other topics of concern, visit the &lt;a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rock Creek Free Press&lt;/a&gt; out of Washington, D.C. and see &lt;a href="http://9-11.meetup.com/307/pages/Newspapers_and_Journals/"&gt;our meetup page for others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have set up a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://mv911t.erideshare.com"&gt;carpooling group&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; online&lt;/b&gt; at eRideShare.com.
