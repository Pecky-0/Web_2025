So we are having a meetup and 3.5 run starting at roughly 2PM. DMs and players looking for games (3.5, Pathfinder, 4.0) are welcome to check out various games. The Liberation of Veshune game players will also be discussing converting from 3.5 to Pathfinder. &lt;br /&gt;We also plan to run a demo of the new D&amp;amp;D:Encounters program sponsored WotC. So far we've had between six and nine players since we started the program at the store. But more players are always welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan J.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan J</member_name><member_id>10199663</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272392445000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271096367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Northshore D&amp;D Meetup at Toys N Things</name><id>13160481</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272218400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/13160481/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/c/global_13082060.jpeg</photo_url></item>
