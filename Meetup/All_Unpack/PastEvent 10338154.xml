So when William Dawes, Jr. went through the British gate on the Boston Neck on the evening of April 18, 1775, he arrived at the town of Roxbury to begin his successful ride. We'll see several of the milestones he passed along his route on this tour. Once abundant farmland, Roxbury included the neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury as well as parts of the Back Bay and South End. &lt;br /&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;This walking tour features: &lt;br /&gt;Eliot Square with its wonderful collection of colonial/early federal architecture whose equal you won't find elsewhere in the City;  the Cochituate Standpipe; the homes of several important figures of nineteenth century Boston; and amazing views from the top of Fort Hill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also talk about the varying ethnic groups who have made Roxbury their home.  Where else in Boston can you see a Puritan Meeting House, a Roman Catholic Basilica and a Mosque in one walk?  Fort Hill and Roxbury are a wonderful neighborhood to explore and discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour costs $15 for the general public (card-carrying Boston By Foot members pay $5 - see &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonbyfo...&lt;/a&gt;) and lasts 90 minutes.  We will meet outside of the Roxbury Crossing T stop (on the orange line).  The intersection is Tremont St/Columbus Ave/Malcolm X Boulevard. There is free on street parking in the vicinity. You can also bike to the starting point on the Southwest Corridor.&lt;br /&gt;This tour is uphill (be warned!) but does make stops along the way.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Boston By Foot badges, bags, hats and whatnot.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gretchen G</member_name><member_id>7594534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246474958000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241481512000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Historic Roxbury/Exploring Fort Hill</name><id>10338154</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245520800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/10338154/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/3/global_8491699.jpeg</photo_url></item>
