I just started snowboarding at the end of last season and loved it...but only went twice and of course have forgotten it all. So time for another beginner lesson. Paula and I took this last Spring and it is truly a great place/way to learn how to snowboard. $79 buys you a lower mountain lift ticket, rental gear, and lesson. So if you haven't been snowboarding but have been thinking about learning this is the perfect time to do it with other beginners!  For those of you that are experienced skiers or boarders feel free to join us at the mountain, we can at least have lunch together and you can laugh as we fall. We'll meet at 9:45AM inside the lodge right in front of the ticket window, this should give us time to get our gear and make the first lesson at 10:30. Start off the New Year right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: These lessons are offered for skiing at the same rate too, so you can do that if you prefer!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside the lodge in front of the ticket area...or call my cell 508 414 8544</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263221827000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262232622000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ski/Board Wachusett</name><id>12181770</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263048300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/12181770/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/d/global_12429197.jpeg</photo_url></item>
