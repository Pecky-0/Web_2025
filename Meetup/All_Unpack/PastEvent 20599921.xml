&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go for a bike ride on the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I thought that we would bike the length of the whole trail which is approximately 5 miles one way in the direction or Westford MA.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Please pack a lunch or snack, as we will stop on our way back on the shore of Hart Pond to enjoy an extended break and re-energize ourselves.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This trail is paved, therefore any type of bike can be used. We can then lunck at the Brickhouse Restaurant next to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone cares to, we can also go in the other direction for another 1 &amp;frac12; miles of riding, but I will leave that up to you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 10:00 am at the rear of the Brickhouse Central Pizza, located at 1 Central Sq, in Chelmsford MA.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This lot has very easy access to the trail, and is right in the center of town.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Central Square is right off of Route 4, which can be accessed from Route 27, 110 or 129. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
