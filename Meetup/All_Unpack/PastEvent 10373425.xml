With all the rain, the trees are really leafing out, and the stream should be flowing nicely - just what we need to relax after work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chatfield Hollow is located on Route 80 in Killingworth, just west of the route 80 / 81 traffic circle. As always, we will meet by the ranger's booth in the entrance to the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One member is bringing her dogs, and others are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMINDER: This is a GROUP event. Once we start walking, if you decide to turn back or take a different trail, please &lt;u&gt;tell the organizer&lt;/u&gt;. We don't want to be wondering what happened, where you went, and if you're all right.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the ranger's booth at the entrance.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243462621000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241875441000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Walk</name><id>10373425</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242252000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/10373425/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/5/global_8102245.jpeg</photo_url></item>
