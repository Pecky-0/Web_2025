We can then get a feel for what types of games everyone plays and how often people would like to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first time we can meet at my home in Salem: 21 Lemon St.  There should be room for everyone.  Let's set the time to meet for 8 p.m.  The street parking does not require a permit.  Feel free to RSVP for friends and spouses, too.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just a warning, there are two cats in the household who will be kept in another room, should anyone have allergies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do ask, if possible, that people chip in $1 for the cost of the meetup, as the website charges groups.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200116139000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187798223000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Board Games Meetup</name><id>6224879</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188604800000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/6224879/</event_url></item>
