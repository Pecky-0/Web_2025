Please park in the small lot next to the Coffee Loft or on the side streets. I was also told that you can park on Lincoln Street as well. Sandra&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Wednesday nights 15 (and growing) members meet to share our craft, share the news of the day and have a good laugh. It's a home away from home for many of us and they are always happy to have us. We bring such cheer to the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If it's not obvious right away, ask the baristas when you enter where we are knitting</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandra Cipriani</member_name><member_id>10013774</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358170863000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Knitters and stitchers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1389430</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6500015259</group_lon><name>Knitting &amp; Needlework in the Boroughs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355184924000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>More Knitting, Crocheting and Needlework at the Coffee Loft</name><id>94876802</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358017200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group/events/94876802/</event_url></item>
