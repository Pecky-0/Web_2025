<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The second hike to the park. 860 acre forested park with Chapman Falls with overall drop of 60 feet over a series of steps. This hike is about 3.4 miles and staying mostly on the orange and &amp;quot;no blaze&amp;quot; trails (Vista and youth group camping area trails). The hike will include the falls, a bridge, senic overlook of the glacially modified valley, and the Devil's Oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking area near the picnic pavilion at 3 PM. The hike is anticipated to take about 1.75 hours and should be done by about 4:45 PM. A trail map can be found at the park link provided. If there is interest, we'll find a place to eat afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions can be found at the location link on this event. Kevin S will lead and is the contact for this one. I hope many of you can join in on the hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/devilshopyard.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/devilshopyard.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1142542849000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike #2 at Devil's Hopyard SP in E.
