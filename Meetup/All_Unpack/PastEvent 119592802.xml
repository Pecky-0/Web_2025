&lt;p&gt;Read the entire description before you RSVP and answer all questions that are part of the RSVP. Failure to answer them will result in your removal from this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you RSVP from a mobile device the questions may not show up - be sure to use a computer to update your RSVP so you can answer them (go back to the event page, click change "RSVP", click "YES", then answer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSVPs for this event will close two days before it is scheduled to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your safety, and the safety of the group, is the most important thing. If you underestimate the demands of this event; overestimate your experience, knowledge, skills or abilities; or come unprepared you put yourself or others at risk – consider this before you decide to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we're doing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to climb one of the 4,000 foot summits in NH - Garfield (#17 @ 4,500'). Upon reaching the summit we will be rewarded with a panoramic views of the surrounding Franconia Ridge and Franconia and Lincoln Brooks valleys. We will use the Garfield Trail to reach the summit and then return to the cars following the same route in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. This trip isn't for you if you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us, if you want to head off on your own, or if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests are not permitted - all participants must be members of the Random Group of Hikers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs are permitted on this hike provided they are experienced "hikers", well-behaved, you bring a leash in case you need to use it, and you have a copy of their most recent rabies vaccination. Be sure to indicate in your RSVP if you will be bringing a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trip Summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this moderate pace (~2.0 MPH) out and back trip we will hike about 10.0 miles and climb about 3,200 feet. It should take an average hiker about 6 hours 45 minutes to complete this trip (this doesn't include time for rest/food breaks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is considered to be INTERMEDIATE because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain. We could alter our plans because of fatigue, weather, and/or other conditions and there is no guarantee that we will complete the entire event as described here (i.e. we might not reach the summit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did my research using the Appalachian Mountain Club's "White Mountain Guide", a trail map, and the Internet. You need to become self-reliant by becoming familiar with the route, terrain, and potential hazards since you are ultimately responsible for your own safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weather&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two ahead of time. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clothing, Gear, Equipment, and Supplies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking safely is about being prepared so that you can respond to an emergency situation or spend a night in the woods if you have to. Failure to bring the basics puts you and the rest of the group at risk. If you don't know what to wear and/or bring with you or have any questions either refer to the list below or contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;· Click for a list of &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/492954/Three_Season_Dayhike_gear_list.pdf"&gt;items needed for a day hike&lt;/a&gt; (Appalachian Mountain Club) &lt;br /&gt;

 Do not rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or on the trail. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have what you need you will not be allowed to participate - even if you carpooled with someone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting in parking lot on the north side of Gale River Loop Road south of Twin Mountain, NH. According to Google Maps this spot is about 149 miles from Boston and it should take about 2 hours 35 minutes to drive there.&lt;/p&gt;

 While carpooling is encouraged you are responsible for coordinating your own rides. Use the comments section below to communicate with others who may also be looking to share a ride. If you do share a ride be sure to share the expenses - suggested donations per person are $20 from Boston MA, $15 from Salem/Nashua NH, and $10 from Concord NH.&lt;/p&gt;
