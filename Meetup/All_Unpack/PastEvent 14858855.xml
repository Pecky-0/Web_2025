Granite Links &amp;quot;football&amp;quot; special is $70 with cart after 1:00pm this Sunday.  They promise you can get football scores on the GPS and later at the Tavern.  With this earlier time frame, there should be no problem finishing before dark and for those who like to eat after golf we should be finishing at a good time - 5:30pm - 6:00pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reservation is held by my credit card, so please if your plans change notify me prior to the 24 hour cancellation they have so you don't get charged for a no show.  I will also be collecting $1 for the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Cindi 339-224-1377&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>putting green just after 1pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cindy</member_name><member_id>5281885</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287855014000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>golf-260</urlname><id>1127024</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2200012207</group_lon><name>The Boston and Beyond Golf Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285172323000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Granite Links -$70    Sun 9/26</name><id>14858855</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285521300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/golf-260/events/14858855/</event_url></item>
