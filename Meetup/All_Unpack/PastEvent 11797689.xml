They have an unusual hobby: posing as top executives of corporations they hate. Armed with nothing but thrift-store suits, the Yes Men lie their way into business conferences and parody their corporate targets in ever more extreme ways - basically doing everything that they can to wake up their audiences to the danger of letting greed run our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On their journey, the Yes Men act as gonzo journalists, delving deep into the question of why we have given the market more power than any other institution to determine our direction as a society. Hope explodes at the end of this film with a power that may take audiences straight out of the theater and into the barricades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus:&lt;/b&gt; This film has one of the very few underwater ballet scenes you will ever see in a political documentary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The anti-globalist performance guys who call themselves the Yes Men are masters of forging corporate rhetoric and media protocols.” -J.
