 "Guess what my money goal was a small of $1450.00 by Thursday, June 14th. &lt;br /&gt;

 I got it, ha! +60.00 and 850.00 + 600.00 tomorrow = 2960.00" ~ U. Washington&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're new to EFT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's this TAPPING gotta do with LoA? That's how we felt when we first heard about this tapping - EFT - thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When combined with LoA principals, &lt;strong&gt;Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)&lt;/strong&gt; has been advocated by LoA experts like Jack Canfield, Joe Vitale and Bob Proctor (who were featured on The Secret) and Michael Losier &lt;em&gt;as a powerful way to tap yourself out of “blocks” that stop you from attracting more of what you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
