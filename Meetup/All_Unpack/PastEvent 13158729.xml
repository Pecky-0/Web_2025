As Conor mentioned, We had people RSVPing on meetup only and not to &amp;quot;rsvp@architects.org&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make up for that, we are having another tour scheduled May 10th at 1:30. Please RSVP by Thursday May 6th to that tour to both:&lt;br /&gt;- rsvp@architects.org with &amp;quot;EPNet 5/5&amp;quot; in the subject line.&lt;br /&gt;- Meetup (this page).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I'm sorry and hope to see you on the 10th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;visit &lt;a href="http://www.genzymecenter.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.genzymecen...&lt;/a&gt; prior to your visit.
