&lt;p&gt;Congrats go out to Lisa St Pierre for winning the&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;raffle basket.&amp;nbsp; Riley - sorry that toy didnt last a&amp;nbsp;bit longer for you.&lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/1723755200050492932723/img/smileys/biggrin.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to assure everyone that our pushy visitor from this afternoon will NOT be back. Also wanted to fill you&amp;nbsp;in some storyline gaps on that woman.&amp;nbsp; About a year&amp;nbsp;ago&amp;nbsp;January she joined the meetup and showed up&amp;nbsp;trying to sell a little puppy.&amp;nbsp;Organizers asked her to leave as that is not what our group is about.&amp;nbsp; It took me a minute to realize it was the same woman today. Julie knew right off the bat and tried to nip the situation in the bud&amp;nbsp;as soon as possible. Anyway - we tried to tell her a few times she wasnt welcome and our play group is for the puggies&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;socialize and have&amp;nbsp;fun and not&amp;nbsp;for a breeding program.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Some of us in the group volunteer for one or more pug rescues and&amp;nbsp;know this is not something a reputable breeder would do.&amp;nbsp;Julie filled Bob ( the owner of Gibson Kennels)&amp;nbsp;in on what happened and he assured us&amp;nbsp;she won't be back.&amp;nbsp; It left a bad&amp;nbsp;vibe&amp;nbsp;with me and Julie&amp;nbsp;and we&amp;nbsp;hope that the incident doesn't stop anyone from bringing their pugs to future meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Gibson's - be sure your pug(s) are up to date with all vaccines - they should definatley be vaccinated for Bortadella ( Kennel Cough) in the setting we are in.&amp;nbsp;( Its a good idea to keep a copy of your dogs vaccines in your car just in case Gibsons asks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a PUG only&amp;nbsp;meetup.&amp;nbsp; There are other small breed meetups out there for your mixed breed.&amp;nbsp;Please keep an eye on your own&amp;nbsp;dog(s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder that there is a $5.00 fee ( I like the term "Dues" better) per family. The majority of the dues collected goes to meetup costs.&amp;nbsp; What are meetup costs? the meetup website costs $45 every three months. I set up a spreadsheet and have started keeping a " free parking" ( monopoly game reference) kitty for future pondering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to keep your pugs safe from Ticks.&amp;nbsp;Also keep in mind with spring blossoms and planting - know what's in your lawn fertilizer and what plants can be toxic to your pets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking foward the May meetup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enjoy the Spring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura&lt;/p&gt;
