<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will be hiking Mt. Lafayette via the  Greenleaf Trail (Rt: 7.6 miles, 3,300 feet, 5:25).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All attendees must read and agree to the Hikers Liability and Waiver, along with the Hikers responsibility code which can be found on this WEB site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering this a winter hike due to the altitude that we are climbing to.  Snowshoes and foot traction are required.  No cotton is allowed.  All hikers should know their abilities.  I am rating this a difficult hike due to the altitude and time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail begins alongside the exit ramps for the Cannon Mt. Aerial Tramway, the old Greenleaf Trail. We will meet in the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway parking lot.  Please park near the entrance so that we can find each other.  This trail begins as a pleasant, rolling amble through mixed north country forest, angling steadily upward and heading south alongside I-93. It eventually switches back a few times and makes a direct assault on the gap between Eagle Cliff and the lower shoulder of Lafayette.&lt;br /&gt;As you approach the gap at Eagle Cliff, a look back reveals that the Greenleaf Trail has made a significant gain in altitude without taking a significant toll on your body. Don't worry; it will. The occasional narrow viewpoints place you high above the interstate and virtually even with the Cannon Cliff. The trail then lulls you even further into a sense of well being, launching into an easy up-and-down section at the crest of the cliff.&lt;br /&gt;After skirting around an interesting mountain marshy area created by drainage from the massive peaks still above, the trail climbs back into the forest. It does so with vengeance. Greenleaf has few switchbacks -- it is mostly just climb, climb, climb, onward and upward over the brutal broken granite.&lt;br /&gt;At times the upward haul seems like it will never end. Mixed pine and hardwoods tower above, giving the trail much the same feeling as alongside the highway, not at all like a forest at 3500' should feel.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the trees grow smaller still, and the typical &amp;quot;fragile alpine zone&amp;quot; sign gives cause for hope. But the trail just slugs on and on. Finally, a fork (keep left); the trail flattens and in another 80 yards the Greenleaf Hut appears. Nestled beneath Mt. Lincoln, &amp;quot;Little&amp;quot; Haystack, and biggest and baddest of all, Mt. Lafayette, the scene is incredible. &lt;br /&gt;Hut-to-summit looks like 15 minutes, but it takes about an hour for the average hiker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All maybe's will be changed to No's on April 20.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dianne and I will be in a black four door Toyota Echo with Maine license plates</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240839454000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237485058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt.
