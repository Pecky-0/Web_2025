Rounding out the Hooked on Who schedule is THE INVASION OF TIME. The Fourth Doctor travels to Gallifrey, dabbles in politics, and deals with the pesky Sontarans. With Leela, and extra bonus K9! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are available now. I strongly suggest you reserve your ticket in advance as these shows do sell out. Go to &lt;a href="http://brattlefilm.org" target="_blank"&gt;brattlefilm.org&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your seat. I'm also organizing a meetup the day before for David Tennant's Planet of the Dead with a bonus audience selected episode. More information on that event can be found &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/calendar/11227352/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $5 per showing. A donation of $25 gets you a ticket to the show and a K-9 t-shirt, not the Tom Baker t-shirt as previously reported. The Brattle has good corn, real butter, and beer on tap.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>74173</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257958268000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251993449000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doctor Who at the Brattle: The Invasion of Time</name><id>11279776</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252805400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11279776/</event_url></item>
