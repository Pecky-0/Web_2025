&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Outdated Email Marketing Best Practices&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Keeping Your Email Program From Driving ROI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop making common email mistakes based on outdated myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a more modern, powerful email marketing program that delivers proven results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;Is your email program not delivering the sales you hoped it would? Are you wondering why, given that you're following all the best practices you learned?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Those email "best practices" may be the very reason that you're not getting the open rates, clickthrough rates, and ROI you hoped. According to Chad Smith, author of the RetailEmail blog, email best practices have changed, and following outdated practices can be undermining your email's performance. With email still the number one driver of conversions for many B2C and B2B companies, it needs to be firing on all cylinders. By modernizing your approach, and avoiding the traps of "best practices" that aren't, you can revamp your email to markedly improve results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of bad advice out there circulating on the Internet that's repeated in reputable publications. In this informal, friendly setting, Chad will dispel some of that misinformation. He will look at some of the top bad advice you might be getting about your email program, how it hurts your results, and what to do instead to create great marketing emails.&lt;/p&gt;
