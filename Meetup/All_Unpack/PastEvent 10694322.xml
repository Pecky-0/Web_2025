We play a wide range of music, from our specialty, Hebrew and Israeli music, all the way to classic Sinatra, Broadway and great rock and roll. In short, we'll have lots of fun!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come out and support Hal in his only public performances of the year. See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stoughton July 26 5:00-7:00&lt;br /&gt;Faxon Veterans Memorial Park&lt;br /&gt;84 Park St.( RT 27) across from Stoughton Library&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  128 to 138 South (exit 2- you are technically on Rt93N).
