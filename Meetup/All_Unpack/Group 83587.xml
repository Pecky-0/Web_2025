If you have an understanding of your intuitive abilities, then this Meetup is where you can be with others like you! We are for all ages, although most Meetup topics are for adults and children ages 12 and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potluck is usually held at 6 PM on the&amp;nbsp;fourth Saturday followed by a speaker who leads us through different experiences&amp;nbsp;to help us find ways we can develop our intuitive abilities.&amp;nbsp; Speakers also present knowledge on Native American Spirituality and other related topics of walking with the Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We each have our unique way to link, and when we have a deep understanding of our abilities, our lives are richer and more profound. Come and walk with us! This group has NO religious affiliation. Be ready for good conversation, good food, and a great experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the topics presented at the potluck, we also have classes and private sessions scheduled at other times.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.84</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1078591118000</created><lat>42.2400016785</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>1858</id><urlkey>indigochildren</urlkey><name>Indigo Children and Parents</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2030</id><urlkey>energyhealers</urlkey><name>Energy Healers</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4131</id><urlkey>empath</urlkey><name>Empath</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>6398</id><urlkey>infp</urlkey><name>INFP</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10290</id><urlkey>spirituality</urlkey><name>Spirituality</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18371</id><urlkey>intuition</urlkey><name>Intuition</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>20870</id><urlkey>native-american-spirituality</urlkey><name>Native American Spirituality</name></topics_item></topics><name>Paths to Light</name><id>83587</id><members>136</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>572960</member_id><name>susan gale</name></organizer><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/5/6/600_7518518.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/5/6/highres_7518518.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>7518518</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/5/6/thumb_7518518.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Cherry Valley</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/</link><lon>-71.8700027466</lon></item>
