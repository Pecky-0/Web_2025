Just thought you may be interested. There are 3 different locations in Boston, one for everyone:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Meditating, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FILM VIEWING AND DISCUSSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GROUND TRUTH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you wondered what politicians mean when they ask us to ?support the troops??&lt;br /&gt;Does it mean they want us to support the Iraq war, no questions asked?&lt;br /&gt;Does it mean that we are supposed to root for the U.S.A. to defeat ?the enemy??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if supporting the troops meant taking the time to listen to their stories? To empathize with them? To be with them in their struggles.&lt;br /&gt;This is the idea behind a powerful new documentary film called ?The Ground Truth,? which chronicles the journeys of Iraq war veterans and their families as they struggle to re-claim their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us on this evening as we come together to initiate the first night of a nationwide movement to engage in conversation and listen to the real stories of Iraq veterans.&lt;br /&gt;Our discussion will focus on honest conversation about the war in Iraq and how to put real meaning behind the words ?support the troops.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As people join across the country from October 4 -11th, we acknowledge the four-year anniversary of the Congressional authorization of ?Use of force against Iraq? and we reflect on the four years that have passed, and we renew our resolve to pray and act for a peaceful resolution to this war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To view the trailer for this film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sojo" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sojo...&lt;/a&gt;. net/index. cfm?actionfiltered= action.display&amp;amp; item=060915_ groundtruth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All donations for this screening will go to The Peace Temple Initiative.&lt;br /&gt;For more information or to submit a prayer, please visit : www.sophiatemple.org &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to spending this evening with you and uniting with many in the spirit of love and support for our brothers and sisters across this land. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:00 pm October 3rd ?
