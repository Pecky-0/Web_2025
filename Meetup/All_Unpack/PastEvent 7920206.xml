Let's meet in front of the theater (outside). Hopefully I'll have the discount card by then... Stay tuned for more info on that one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you haven't already. Feel free to bring friends -- but be sure to include them in your RSVP if they can come.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the season of blockbuster movies (Narnia, Indy Jones), I thought I'd throw a comedy in the mix. Let's go see something light-hearted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809859459/info" target="_blank"&gt;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&lt;/a&gt; is going to be wicked funny. It's made by the guys from 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and stars Jason Segel, from &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/how_i_met_your_mother/" target="_blank"&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/a&gt; (which I looove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there with my husband, Paul. He's tall and blond, so if you don't see me and my long blond hair, you'll most certainly see him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's pick the show that begins between 7:00 and 8:00. I'll update when the date gets closer as to the precise time (let's plan to show up about 15 minutes before the movie starts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll buy tickets together, since I should have my discount card by then. Tickets will be $8.50 for FMM members and guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring kids, teens, friends, spouses, loved ones, liked ones, etc. Just remember to include them in your RSVP so I know who to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, name tags will be available so that we can get to know each other. We'll head out to TGI Friday's after the movie, if people are interested, to discuss/socialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you next Sunday! Have a great week, everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting outside the theater with my meetup name tag on.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211338585000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>(This is a nugget for those of you who didn't want to wait another week for a movie meetup!)</why><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210561193000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</name><id>7920206</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211153400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/7920206/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
