Thank you for understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;TOTS Class Description:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itsy Bitsy Yoga for Tots is a supportive, fun-loving, and active yoga class. As tot’s mobility increases, classes offer tot-centric poses that encourage and support their physical explorations. Tots become more confident in their moving bodies as they practice yoga both in and out of class. &lt;br /&gt;During a Tots Itsy Bitsy Yoga class crawlers and walkers playfully practice yoga postures while they are standing, sitting up, walking, and jumping. Parents also get to do a little yoga, but &lt;i&gt;no yoga experience is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Absolute Yoga</member_name><member_id>7939252</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325695051000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Yogis Big and Small</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Growing-Families-Yoga-Meetup</urlname><id>1341870</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>Growing Families Yoga Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229956460000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend Tots Yoga Meetup (January)</name><id>9375414</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232827200000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Growing-Families-Yoga-Meetup/events/9375414/</event_url></item>
