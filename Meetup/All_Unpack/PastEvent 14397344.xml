Let's raise our glasses to toast the end of summer with a romp through the vineyards of Champagne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it's a rather small region with fairly limited stylistic choices, I'd like to focus the meeting on a range of price points from everyday Champagne to the higher end of the spectrum.  Since this will likely result in a higher per person cost, we'll only taste 3-4 Champagnes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, looking for volunteers to purchase wine (you will be reimbursed) and to bring appetizers to share. The cost of the wines will be spread amongst those who attend.  Think festive, think fun, think Champagne!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noel</member_name><member_id>8463776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282920387000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>White Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1441608</id><group_lat>42.5900001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281577232000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August Meeting--Champagne!</name><id>14397344</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282863600000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/events/14397344/</event_url></item>
