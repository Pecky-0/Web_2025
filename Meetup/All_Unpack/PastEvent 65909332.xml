&lt;p&gt;So if you'd like a good chance to say goodbye, join George at Prime!  He'll post his contact info later on tonight, and will be making a reservation once RSVP's close around 4 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since George is making a reservation, please try not to No Show or "Maybe", thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for / Contact George, he plans to make a reservation at RSVP close.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6417513</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337903256000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337727540000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Farwell to George Dinner</name><id>65909332</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337817600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/65909332/</event_url></item>
