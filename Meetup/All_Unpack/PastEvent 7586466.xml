Standard Hearing rules apply - &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Blue sheet&lt;/span&gt; to support or oppose, &lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;pink card to speak&lt;/span&gt;. Make no speech longer than 5 minutes (3 is better); don't repeat what others have said.  The hearing is scheduled to begin at 1:00 PM, however I recommend that you show up a early to let your presence be known.&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;NH law specifically prohibits compliance with Real-ID.  And here is the Senate, all 24 of 'em, voting to urge the Governor to file for an extension so we can come into &amp;quot;compliance&amp;quot; with REAL-ID!  This is the Senate playing legal word-games in a way the Governor was quite &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=T2l6wXBP2AY" target="_blank"&gt;possibly fully anticipating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SB 434 reads, quote: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The governor, or designee, is requested to apply for an extension from the federal government of the deadline for compliance with the REAL ID Act of 2005. Such a request shall not constitute &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot; in REAL ID in violation of state law. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We need people to show up EN MASSE to oppose this!&lt;/b&gt;  Once again -- just like in 2006 -- it seems the NH Senate does not realize they are being watched so closely. Perhaps they think a 'tiny' amendment in an unrelated bill will go unnoticed? THINK AGAIN!  If you can't be there in person, send an email to the members of the Committee Ask them not to pass SB434, or at least to remove the Real-ID section.
