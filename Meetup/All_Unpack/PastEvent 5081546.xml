<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This meetup is the raindate for the October 4th date.  I woke this morning and checked out the weather forecast.  Apparently, Wednesday evening will be host to rain, thunder and lightning-not good ingredients for a meetup, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking that we could talk about fanblogs and the 'bloggerazzi.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, my original idea, which is to get to know each other and inform each other about our current blogging experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, this meetup is open to all levels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like last time, I'll grab some space beside the large screen or near the door and I will have a sign on the table. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emma</member_name><member_id>2161382</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1160778954000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bloggers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bloggers</urlname><id>21458</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Area Weblogger Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1155773364000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Weblogger October Meetup</name><id>5081546</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1160605800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bloggers/events/5081546/</event_url></item>
