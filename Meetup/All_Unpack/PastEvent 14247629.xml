Edgar Cayce said, &amp;quot;Nothing important ever happens to us without first being previewed in dreams.&amp;quot; Even Freud's patients had precognitive dreams. Have you ever dreamed something and had it come true? How can we recognize precognitive dreams? How can we encourage and increase precognitive dreams? We will share and discuss our precognitive dreams as well as techniques for recognizing and encouraging dreams of the future. Please feel free to share any such dream experiences you may have had. They could be little deja vu's, dreams of scenes you later see in the news, premonitions that later come true, or useful advice from dreams for situations that later come up in your personal life. Please come if you find the topic interesting, even if you have not had any precognitive experiences. Whether you have had precognitive dreams or not, this program will be fascinating and informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deerheart will be facilitating. He is a visionary artist, a spiritual advisor, a practicing shaman, and a dream guide. An experienced explorer of the dream realms for for over 25 years, he has researched and studied many books and studied under many teachers.
