We will then be having a &amp;quot;pay your own dinner&amp;quot;, in the &amp;quot;ghost room&amp;quot; which is where most of the haunted activities occur, and then for those who would like to stay after dinner, drinks in the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the dinner menu at: &lt;a href="http://stonespublichouse.com/menu.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://stonespublicho...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During dinner we will be having a converstion on tales from the other side with &amp;quot;Share your ghost story&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Stone's Inn&lt;br /&gt;(Now known as Stone's Public House)&lt;br /&gt;179 Main St.&lt;br /&gt;Ashland, Ma 01721&lt;br /&gt;(508) 881 1778&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from the North take:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;495 South &lt;br /&gt;to Exit 23 ( Take Rte 9 East)&lt;br /&gt;Travel 3 miles on Rte 9 to intersection&lt;br /&gt;with Oak Hill Rd on the right&lt;br /&gt;Turn Right onto Oak Hill Rd&lt;br /&gt;Follow it until it merges with Cordaville Rd.&lt;br /&gt;(merging Left)&lt;br /&gt;Follow this until it joins onto Pleasant St.&lt;br /&gt;Follow Pleasant St to the end which will be&lt;br /&gt;Main St.&lt;br /&gt;Turn Right onto Main St.&lt;br /&gt;And it should be right there at the railroad tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take the phone number with you, in case you &lt;br /&gt;get lost, you can call the inn....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also my number is (508) 847- 7677&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a few other things...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep track of the total your dinner and drinks, so at the end, you can give Tony the money to pay the bill, which I am sure is going to be HUGE....lol....also, please add a tip to your own total, I am sure for large parties they are going to add the tip to the bill. An easy way I figure out how much my tip is, is to figure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$2 for every $10 spent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if your bill comes to $20&lt;br /&gt;your tip would be $4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get there, ask for the &amp;quot;Meet-up&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;and they will tell you where to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are meeting at 5pm-&lt;br /&gt;The tour and talk will begin promptly at 5:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really, really looking forward to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, Tala&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Meet-Up at the door :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tala</member_name><member_id>5511934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204076440000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><why>Why?
