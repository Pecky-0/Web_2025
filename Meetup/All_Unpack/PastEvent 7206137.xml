Tom Resevoir.  We will be doing many fun outdoor activities with disabled individuals.  Please refer to their website to get an idea of their committment to this great cause and the kind of winter activities we will do.  I encourage as many of us to volunteer.  You do not have to exert yourself physically to be a part.  This organization is seeking individuals who are willing to meet and greet, and just share your time and laughter with others, so please do.  You have to call in advance to let them know you will be there.  Thank you so much for your support and see you there!!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202227575000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201452100000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>All Outdoor Adventures Day</name><id>7206137</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202054400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/7206137/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/6/b/global_2890459.jpeg</photo_url></item>
