<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though we'll be getting together Saturday for the October 11 evaluation meeting and &amp;quot;Spook the Wars&amp;quot; fundraising party, the Stop the Wars Coalition will meet next Monday, 27 October, starting at 6:30 pm in Encuentro5.  Please bring your ideas, energy, and enthusiasm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the agenda is organizing to promote the National Assembly's &amp;quot;Open Letter to the U.S. Antiwar Movement&amp;quot;, which will probably be discussed Saturday as well.  I'm sure we'll review how the fundraiser went, and deal with any loose threads left hanging from it.  There has been some preliminary discussion of organizing an action in the near future focused on the economy and the war at home, and I believe there are also still a couple of proposals floating around about how we can best support Encuentro5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please send any additional items you think should be on the agenda.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Schaich</member_name><member_id>4406518</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Andrews</member_name><member_id>5009779</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Harris</member_name><member_id>5188497</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suren Moodliar</member_name><member_id>5714882</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226362862000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People for Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>stopthewars</urlname><id>708558</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Antiwar</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222128648000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Antiwar Meetup</name><id>8811867</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225146600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/stopthewars/events/8811867/</event_url></item>
