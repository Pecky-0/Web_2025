Or maybe a book that's not your type, but someone else may enjoy? Then join us for dinner at the Olive Garden in Framingham (conveniently located in Shopper's World off Rt. 9). We will enjoy dinner, then swap books. Book swap is optional. you can still come and enjoy dinner and hanging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure that your books are in excellent condition, may be hardcover or paperback. Please no textbooks! You may bring two or three books if you would like. Please know that once you swap books, your original books will not be returned to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo) inside ent.
