I cannot say what the movies are. The Research Group&lt;br /&gt;Has informed their members what the Movies are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets at an undiscosed cost must be brought for this event.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I just recently found out that this is a Research Group&lt;br /&gt;Members Only Event so non members cannot take part in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if there will be room for me to attend until&lt;br /&gt;a little before the date of the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Research Group is having a Movie Screening on the&lt;br /&gt;Evening of June 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sgra.org/paracon/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sgra.org/p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.sgra.org/paracon/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SGRA has brought some issues to my attention.&lt;br /&gt;My way of handling those issues is to have this memo in all&lt;br /&gt;SGRA Meet Ups in 2009.&lt;br /&gt;SGRA Events ARE NOT TOTALLY FREE.&lt;br /&gt;They have raffle and meal tickets that cost money.&lt;br /&gt;Some events have booklets that cost money.&lt;br /&gt;SGRA and the Vendors sell products that cost money.&lt;br /&gt;Psychics and others give readings that cost money.&lt;br /&gt;You can go on their site of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sgra-media.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sgra-media...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.sgra-media.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details and some things can be&lt;br /&gt;Purchased on line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SGRA asks for a donation for attending some of their events.&lt;br /&gt;(Yea, I know.  You can talk to them about the difference between&lt;br /&gt;a donation and charging admission.  I am not getting involved.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Research Group are POCs for this Event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244419778000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Conspiracists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>conspiracy-83</urlname><id>648888</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Greater New Haven Unknown Zone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238882508000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Unknown Zone Research Members attend Movie Screening at Ho Jos on June 5</name><id>10116053</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244246400000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/conspiracy-83/events/10116053/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/f/f/global_2489375.jpeg</photo_url></item>
