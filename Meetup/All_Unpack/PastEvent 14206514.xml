<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Quick, can you name a local neighborhood that straddles three different counties?  &lt;br /&gt;Ding, ding, ding...the answer is Chestnut Hill.  Chestnut Hill occupies the area where Boston, Brookline and Newton meet.  [Boston =Suffolk County, Brookline = Norfolk County and Newton = Middlesex County]. You've heard of it right?  But maybe you're not really sure exactly what's there, so come along on this tour to find out. Don't worry we are not covering all three of the municipalities, we'll just concentrate on the Newton part of Chestnut Hill for this tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One writer called Chestnut Hill &amp;quot;suburban living at its best&amp;quot; and he was right! We'll explore a neighborhood that evolved along with the available transportation.  Changing over from early farms to full-scale mansions as the roads, trains and trolleys opened the area up. There are also some large areas taken up by an academic institution (Go Eagles!) as well as the Chestnut Hill Reservoir. We'll explore them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned, it's a fairly long route and there is a hill (hence the name) so dress for some walking.  Also this tour has a non-circular route. So if you park at the starting location you'll have about a 10 minute walk back to your car.  For those taking the T, we'll end just by the next stop along the green line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tour costs $15 for the general public (it is $5 for card-carrying Boston By Foot members - find out how to join &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Tour will proceed regardless of the weather and reservations are not required.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for folks with Boston By Foot badges, bags, hats, etc.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gretchen G</member_name><member_id>7594534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287685819000</updated><rating><average>3.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280073155000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chestnut Hill walking tour</name><id>14206514</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283104800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/14206514/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/5/0/global_4708432.jpeg</photo_url></item>
