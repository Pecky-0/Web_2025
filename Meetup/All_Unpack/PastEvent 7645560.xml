Once again, your selection for our latest &amp;quot;letter&amp;quot; restaurant has SSDOMG heading south! For our &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; restaurant, you chose the countrified, yet elegant &lt;a href="http://www.cranebrook.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Crane Brook Restaurant &amp;amp; Tea Room&lt;/a&gt; in South Carver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located near the clear waters of Sampson's Pond on a site that featured a cannonball-producing iron foundry during the War of 1812, Crane Brook has been a well regarded restaurant for a long time. It is a place to come when you're in the mood for good food and unhurried conversation. &lt;a href="http://www.cranebrook.com/menu_lunch.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Lunch offerings&lt;/a&gt; range from an 8 oz. Black Angus Hamburger ($8.95) to an Artisanal Salami &amp;amp; Ham Board ($14.95), and even include a Bouilliabase ($13.95).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike, who suggested this venue, is looking forward to sharing Crane Brook's food and atmosphere with his fellow SSDOMG members. Please join us as, like the &lt;a href="http://www.arthurgrosset.com/europebirds/photos/egrgar14325.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;hunting crane&lt;/a&gt; itself, we once again stalk a memorable culinary experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crane Brook Restaurant &amp;amp; Tea Room.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;229 Tremont St., South Carver&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, April 26, 2008 @ 1:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizer:&lt;/b&gt; Mike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Min/Max:&lt;/b&gt; None at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Yes.
