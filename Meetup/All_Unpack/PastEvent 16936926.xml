After seeing success in the &amp;lsquo;70s, opting out of the &amp;lsquo;80s, nudging his way back in the &amp;lsquo;90s and finding his niche in the new millennium, he still makes music that&amp;rsquo;s touching, timeless, and imbued with universal appeal, while continuing his solo and band performances around the country. In addition to performing, Jon continues working hard on the Estate of Richard Pousette-Dart, which promotes the works of his late father, the eminent abstract expressionist.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/pousettedart"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/pousettedart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;James Montgomery was called "The John Mayall of New England,&amp;rdquo; by Peter Wolf (J Geils Band). While growing up in Detroit James learned first-hand from the masters - James Cotton, John Lee Hooker, and Jr. Wells - at the legendary Chessmate Club. Over the years, he's carried on in the tradition and continues to be a vital presence in Blues as one of the most dynamic performers on the scene. James Montgomery has toured with among others: Johnny Winter, The Allman Brothers, Steve Miller, Bruce Springsteen, Aerosmith, B.B.King, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Jr. Wells, James Cotton, Charlie Daniels, Bonnie Raitt, and The Blues Brothers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/jamesmontgomeryblues"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/jamesmontgomeryblues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bruce Marshall has released 6 records and shared the stage with over 150 national acts.&amp;nbsp; He is a former member of The Toy Caldwell Band (formed from members of Marshall Tucker). He's toured with Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Outlaws and Charlie Daniels. Bruce has represented New England twice at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, placed songs in film, won 2 Blues Audience Magazine Readers Poll Awards and was the vocalist for WB Mason Extra Innings on NESN TV 3 years running. He's now in his 37th year of full time music-making, and has played over 7,000 shows with no signs of ever slowing down. The Montgomery &amp;amp; Marshall Duo began in 1994 and has released 2 CD's, headlined national shows and was nominated for a Boston Music Award.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/brucemarshallmusic"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/brucemarshallmusic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Facebook Event Page &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=118084194933228"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=118084194933228&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Presented by M.E.
