We're a co-ed dragon boat team and we're always looking for new paddlers to join us. This is a great way to get in shape, stay in shape, meet people, and do something fun and competitive.&amp;nbsp; We meet at 6 pm at the docks behind Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (125 Nashua Street, Boston), and practice runs until 8 pm.&amp;nbsp; Parking is available for $5 (tell the parking attendant that you are there to use the boats), and Spaulding is close to Science Park (Green Line), Charles/MGH (Red Line), or North Station (Orange Line).&amp;nbsp; We paddle rain or shine, so dress for the weather.&amp;nbsp; There are facilities in the hospital where you can get changed, and we can lock up anything you don't want to bring with you on the boat.&amp;nbsp; Bring a bottle of water, and we'll provide all the paddling equipment you'll need.&amp;nbsp; We often head out for a quick bite to eat after practice, and you're welcome to join us.&amp;nbsp; Send questions to: Dave Parker at dfitzparker@gmail.com [url=&lt;a href="http://www.livingroot.org/]www.livingroot.org[/url" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.livingroot.org/]www.livingroot.org[/url&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the tall guy with a paddle or a clipboard.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Parker</member_name><member_id>7135817</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334764058000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddle-boston</urlname><id>1135553</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Living Root Dragon Boat - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333825166000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dragon Boat Practice Session</name><id>dkclrcyqgbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334700000000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddle-boston/events/59646522/</event_url></item>
