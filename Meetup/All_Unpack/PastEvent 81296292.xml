Looking to stay local this time with a NEW VENUE.  District 7 is a very cool new(ish) spot in downtown Malden.  It's a fireman themed pub and boasts great food and fun! I was there last week to check it out and seems like a cool place to do some trivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tag Team Trivia" starts at 8:00pm. Come early to get a good seat and get on a good team! First place is a $20 gift card to District 7, 2nd place is $10 gift card, and a $5 CASH prize to best team name.  District 7 has $1.99 Bud Light draft and $3 Whale's Tail draft specials. Their menu is really, REALLY great too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District 7 is conveniently located within walking distance of Malden Center Station (Orange Line and Commuter Rail).  There is also ample street parking available.  If this meetup/venue is popular, I may host every week but for now, this is a ONE TIME EVENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask bartenders for MeetUp group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabel Bourelle</member_name><member_id>8394555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347504383000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347024304000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tag Team Trivia at District 7 in Malden</name><id>81296292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347492600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/81296292/</event_url></item>
