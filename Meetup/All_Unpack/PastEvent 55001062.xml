&lt;p&gt;It's RIVALRY time! Come on down and cheer on the Boston Celtics as they take on the Los Angeles Lakers (boo! hiss!) this coming Sunday.&amp;nbsp; Tip-off is at 3:30pm.&amp;nbsp; Come early to get a good seat!&amp;nbsp; I should be there by 3pm at the LATEST (also want to get myself a good seat).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Place is newly renovated and has added a bunch of new TVs.&amp;nbsp; They will be having a free buffet (wings, pasta, salad) during game time.&amp;nbsp; Guinness will also be there showcasing their new "Guinness Black".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rumor has it there will also be prizes and raffles.&amp;nbsp; ;)&amp;nbsp; No cover charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests and friends are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Place is conveniently located in the Financial District very near Faneuil Hall.&amp;nbsp; It's near the Orange Line (State Street), Blue Line (State Street, Aquarium), and a short walk to the Green (Gov't Center) and Red (Park Street) Lines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will buy a beer/drink for the first person to show up in Laker Haters gear!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture and will be wearing a green Celtics shirt and hat.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabel Bourelle</member_name><member_id>8394555</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Red Sox Natives</member_name><member_id>12040580</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331519749000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330919309000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Celtics Game Viewing Party @ The Place Sunday Mar 11th</name><id>55001062</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1331492400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/55001062/</event_url></item>
