We eat all our meals at the &lt;i&gt;Sukkah&lt;/i&gt;, a hut-like temporary construction of walls without the roof, under the open sky. In fact, for seven days we make this temporary dwelling our home. We refrain from eating or drinking anything outside of the Sukkah, even a glass of water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will learn about, and experience &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Four Kinds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; -- lulav, etrog, hadass and aravah, and learn the kabbalistic meaning of the ancient ritual, which evokes the spiritual powers of 'four directions' and quality of the Divine attributes within ourselves. We perform the &lt;i&gt;Four Kinds&lt;/i&gt; ritual and meditatively experience its power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will talk about &lt;i&gt;Water Drawing Celebration&lt;/i&gt; -- the most joyful celebration that took place when the Temple stood in Jerusalem; in all-night celebrations, water was poured on the Altar, processions, dancing, singing and playing musical instruments continued for 6 nights till daybreaks, 'drawing water with joy'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been said that 'one who did not see the joy of the water-drawing celebrations, has not seen joy in his life.' We will talk about and re-enact, meditatively relive these ancient rituals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also continue to learn meditative practice of blessing as a main way of receiving &lt;i&gt;Ruach HaKodesh,&lt;/i&gt; Divine Inspiration: amazing deep meditative practice that is capable of changing one's life on all levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Place:&lt;/b&gt; my home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, September 25, 2:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to bring:&lt;/b&gt; On Saturday it is Shabbat, we do not carry anything and can't use any contributions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to dress:&lt;/b&gt; Any way you feel is appropriate to honor the Presence. Also weather appropriate, because we will dwell in Sukkah (outdoors). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monetary contributions: Suggested offering is $20. Part of your offering will go to charity. &lt;br /&gt;Please contribute online with paypal only should you choose to do so, as we do not handle business matters on Shabbat. *No material contribution is required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to our Sukkot Shabbat together!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Miriam </member_name><member_id>7891623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285467016000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Kabbalah-and-Meditation</urlname><id>1557684</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>Kabbalah and Meditation</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283394040000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kabbalah at the Shabbat Table: Festival of Sukkot</name><id>14627520</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285437600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Kabbalah-and-Meditation/events/14627520/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/1/1/global_17650113.jpeg</photo_url></item>
