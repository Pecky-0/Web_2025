They would run for 45 min. and would cost $15.00 + $1.00 meetup.com charge for each person - so $16.00 total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a certified Total Immersion swim coach and without her help I would have never gotten through my first tri. (I was a total noob to swimming). The clinic will cover things such as swim technique, sighting, turning and swimming in a group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Date / Time:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; July 12th at 7:30 AM at Walden pond. Please arrive by 7:15AM to fill out waiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meeting Place:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The group will meet in front of the beach house of Walden pond across from the visitors center, where there is parking (for a fee). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more information on the park, parking and directions:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/walden/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimum of 4 people and a max of 10.  I'm going to have to say it's a first come first serve basis, and if the clinics fill up we'll have to somehow regulate that a person can only partake in one clinic so everyone gets their fair share. Also, Katherine has been having a problem with people not showing and I ask that if you confirm being there as a &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; that you please attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wetsuits are not required. At this time of year the water in Walden is warm enough that one is not necessary. A lot of people chose to wear them just because they help keep you more buoyant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about Katherine here: &lt;br /&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.munchkinmovement.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.munchkinmovement.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.munchkinmo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bigdreamsf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Katherine online resume includes a face shot so you can try to recognize her: &lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/coaching_resume.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/coaching_resume.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bigdreamsf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is well received! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's to happy confident open-water swimming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Rebecca&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I would appreciate it, if after the clinic you could please leave some feedback.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In Front of the Walden Pond Beach House</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216035516000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><why>People interested in swimming technique and open water swim pointers.</why><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213154822000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Water Swim Clinic - Walden Pond</name><id>8120792</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215862200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/8120792/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/2/global_1776498.jpeg</photo_url></item>
