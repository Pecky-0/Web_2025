David will talk about the market and then will take stock requests.  This is an online webinar in the private David Elliot Chat room on Thinkorswim.  For all those I helped get set up on Thinkorswim Monday, here is your chance to try things out.  If you don't have Thinkorswim, consider downloading it.  It's free education!  Once you download it, you need to call or use the live support to get David's Chat room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have David's chat room, just open ThinkorSwim a few minutes before 9pm and Click on Chat in the upper left corner.  Open the David Elliot Chat room.  Click Listen.  Click Watch.  You will have two windows - a chat window and a chart window.  You will hear David and be able to type in chat requests in the chat window.  He will be talking to the charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, David is also on the Thinkorswim chat room most of each trading day, but he is doing this webinar Tuesday specifically for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so I get an idea of how many virtual attendees we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!  Learn!  Trade well!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff Orrik</member_name><member_id>1135788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233886295000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Investor$ who think 4 themselve$</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonIBD</urlname><id>81154</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Investor's Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233634731000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>David Elliot (Firstwave) Webinar</name><id>9660371</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233712800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonIBD/events/9660371/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/9/global_4808969.jpeg</photo_url></item>
