It is believed that this is also where some of our &amp;quot;past life&amp;quot; memory information comes from.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once we identify the &amp;quot;emotional matrix&amp;quot; (our feelings about it) we begin to identify the patterns. We follow this &amp;quot;emotional matrix&amp;quot; back to an event or series of events that were suppressed into our cellular memory and how we created these patterns to survive. Once identified, we can clear these patterns to make new higher and better choices available.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come discover your operating system potentials by exploring your cellular memory and how it may be preventing you from manifesting your true desires. These cellular memories and genetic patterns are innate in all of us. Once you know what your patterns are the release becomes as easy as making a new choice. The results are a profound life operating system upgrade!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our “Weeping Angel Foundation” office is located at 190 Old Derby Street Hingham, MA 02043 Suite 100&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take Route 3  to exit 15 Derby Street for Weymouth / Hingham  &lt;br /&gt;at end of ramp turn RIGHT. &lt;br /&gt;continue back over route 3 and take the 1st LEFT onto Old Derby Street. &lt;br /&gt;Follow to end of street building is on the LEFT&lt;br /&gt;Suite 100 is in the lower level of the building&lt;br /&gt;Call the foundation office number for additional directions if needed 781-749-0916&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are asking for a $20.00 love donation which will benefit Our Weeping Angel Foundation's healing fund. www.ourweepingangel.org (not required- give as you please)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/boston-energy-healers/pages/www.ourweepingangel.org"&gt;www.ourweepingangel.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come on in!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Glenn P DeRosa</member_name><member_id>4460952</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280967755000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Healing Practitioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-healers-network</urlname><id>511093</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Healers Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280765416000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Cellular Memory Release Event</name><id>14291550</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280962800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-healers-network/events/14291550/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/4/b/global_7529195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
