Each of the five wisdoms is an expression of the awakened state that is embodied in different styles of expressing awakened wisdom.&lt;/b&gt;  As this energy becomes confused and contracted, it forms different styles of ego contraction.  Understanding our Buddha family can help liberate our confusion into awakening and help us in developing a more integral expression of awakening that includes intellectual, evolutionary, passionate, service, and meditative perspectives.  In Buddhist philosophy, these energies not only form the qualities of the upper left quadrant, but also are the primordial energies expressed through all other quadrants. Join us for an informative evening, as we explore these types and the Mandela of integral awakening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;John Churchill has been a student of integral thought and Buddhist practice for 16 years. John is also the co-founder of Samadhi Integral Life Practice Center, as well as a Buddhist meditation and yoga teacher, acupuncturist and Integral guide.  John has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Contemplative Psychology from Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado and a Masters Degree in Acupuncture from the New England School of Acupuncture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ted</member_name><member_id>1467536</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259884905000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253727942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Five Wisdom Energies (Buddha Families)</name><id>11447765</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255648500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/11447765/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/f/global_7098607.jpeg</photo_url></item>
