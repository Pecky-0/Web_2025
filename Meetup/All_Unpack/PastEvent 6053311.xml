You wind through 10-foot-tall marsh reeds and generally avoid the voluminous summer boating traffic. Whereas deeper-draft boats have to pay attention to the charts, kayaks can wander all over the place in the shallow waters here. Another advantage of the lower Connecticut is that three-quarters of the 1-mile?wide mouth averages a few feet in depth, which serves to keep motorboats to a minimum or forces them into the west channel, which exits through two stone breakwaters beyond Saybrook Point Lighthouse. The water just off the breakwaters is also very shallow? even small boats sometimes get grounded. Great Island offers good summer sea kayaking amid marsh grass, seaside goldenrod, glasswort, sea lavender, and water hemp.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This popular launch site, located less than 500 feet from the Great Island Wildlife Management Area, provides visitors with opportunities to explore tidal marshes and a barrier beach. It is important to note, however, that motorized vessels must remain a reasonable distance away from the Great Island Wildlife Management Area upon launching. A water trail map of the Great Island estuary is posted near the entrance of this site's parking lot, and offers descriptions of a car-top boat trail (which would take visitors approximately 1.5 hours to traverse south to Griswold Point and approximately 3 hours in duration to return to the launch for the average kayak or canoe user). The map also introduces the history, flora, and fauna of the area. PLEASE NOTE: Visitors should investigate tide tables before launching boats at this site, due to the extremely shallow depth of water at low tide. Some routes to this site are marked with brown and white boat launch signs. To help you reach Great Island State Boat Launch, some routes leading to this site are posted with the brown and white Long Island Sound Access sign .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location &lt;br /&gt; Smith Neck Road &lt;br /&gt;Old Lyme, Connecticut &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Fees &lt;br /&gt;None &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from hartford:&lt;br /&gt;i use rte 9 south past essex to 95 north right before Old Lyme, cross the bridge and the exit is near..&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Directions &lt;br /&gt;From the East: Take I-95 South to Exit 70.
