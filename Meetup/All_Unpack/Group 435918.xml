Do you sense that there must be a Universal Spirit or God and wish you could feel more connected to it? Would you like to meet other people who are interested in spirituality and finding inner peace? This group meets weekly for classes on meditation and learning the practice of mysticism, or how to experience God inside yourself. We discuss ways to go deeper in meditation, and share personal experiences of meditation or spiritual seeking. We also have occasional gatherings to watch and have a conversation about a movie that has a spiritually relevant theme. Other events and seminars that may be of interest to group members will also be posted. If you are interested in spirituality and want to talk about stuff that's real, personal, and really matters, we welcome you!&lt;/p&gt;
