The spawn of Alicia Palleschi’s bored brain, Exposure Arts Boston is concerned with the huge amounts of untapped, latent creativity that lies in your roommates’ closet. Had Alicia and I not raided my own roommates’ closet one smoky afternoon, we would never have known what a brilliant and visionary painter she is. Then began the realization…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our aim is to gather these unknown artists, expose their work, inspire anyone who’s interested, and generally give them an outlet unlike any others. We are college graduates, part-time workers, full-time workers, and undergraduates who simply would like to see more art at it’s most base level - pulled from that closet and displayed on our street corners. Please, join us. exposureartsboston@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251407140000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Creative People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCreative</urlname><id>919281</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Creative People</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239660369000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Exposure Arts outdoor gallery</name><id>10177797</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244865600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCreative/events/10177797/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/d/0/global_8860304.jpeg</photo_url></item>
