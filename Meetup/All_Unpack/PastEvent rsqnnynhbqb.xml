If you are interested in this class, you can join the next series starting May 19th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is more info about this course on Meditation and Christian Mysticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever ask yourself why you are on this earth? What is life about? And is there more?&lt;br /&gt;If yes, this course is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a powerful 6-week introductory course designed for modern mystics. Classes will include teachings on: the Inner Spiritual Path, Meditation, Soul, Light, Prayer and Blessing. Time will be spent teaching the principles of meditation that will allow you to move deeper than the body, beyond thinking and emotions, and into the reality of God's peace and presence within. In each class we explore three areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Understanding the cosmos, the Laws and Beings that govern it, and our roles as living, conscious humans in that cosmos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Spiritual exercises designed to help you develop skills needed for inner work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Hands-on experiences, through which you can learn to see, hear, and feel the spiritual world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This course is free of charge, as are all of our classes. This class will be taught by Rev. Christine in her home in North-Cambridge.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ring the bell on the front door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273708282000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-684</urlname><id>1246909</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Meditation Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273119498000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>4th session of the series on Meditation and Mysticism</name><id>rsqnnynhbqb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273704300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-684/events/13401027/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/7/global_5061495.jpeg</photo_url></item>
