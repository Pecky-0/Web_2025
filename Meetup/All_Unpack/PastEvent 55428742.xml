&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Setting goals, determining measurable milestones, and taking consistent action are great ways to move forward toward what you want in life. I'd like to share with you a fun activity I often use that can jump-start the process. It's a collage-making activity, and the end product is called a vision board, dream map, treasure map, or dream board. Vision boards are powerful tools for self-discovery and manifestation. They are based on a tried and true approach: that clearly picturing and creating a visual image of a desired outcome helps it come true.&lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp;Set aside two hours, bring your passions, aspirations, and intentions, mix them with paper, scissors, glue sticks, and magazines, and see what takes shape! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Think about what you'd like to manifest in your life. &lt;br /&gt;

 * What would you like more of? &lt;br /&gt;

 * What's missing from your life right now? &lt;br /&gt;

 * What may already be in your life that you'd like to devote more time to? &lt;br /&gt;

 * Do you want to switch careers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;* What adventures do you want to explore?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;* What accomplishments do you want to achieve?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
