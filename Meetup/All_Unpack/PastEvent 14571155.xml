<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>If skies are clear, this will be a good evening for a full moon paddle.  Sunset is at 6:43, moonrise at 5:41, 98.5% illuminated.  It's a Tuesday, but with the early moonrise and sunset we should be able to be off the water at a reasonable time (9:00 PM-ish).  I'd like to keep the following day, Wednesday as a &amp;quot;rain-date&amp;quot; in case of uncooperative weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at Whitehall State Park boat ramp on Route 135 in Hopkinton, MA.  Please arrive in time to unload your kayak and be in the water and ready to paddle by 6:15 at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to wear your PFD and you'll need a whistle and a light (headlamp works best and is easiest to manage, but a flashlight is OK).  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nancy H</member_name><member_id>7962459</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285196906000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283005281000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Full Moon Paddle at Whitehall</name><id>14571155</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285106400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/14571155/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
