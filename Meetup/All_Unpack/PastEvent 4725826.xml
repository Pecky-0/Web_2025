It's showing at the Boston Public Library in Copley Square at 6p.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add some more information about it on the Meetup website, so you can read it before we go. Please let me know if you can come. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Klondike Annie&amp;quot;(1936) is a comedy written by and starring the famous actress Mae West. She was very sexy and very funny, and became famous for a lot of one-line jokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can come earlier, let me know. We can meet at the library at 5:30 to talk first. The movie is 77 minutes long. If you can't come early, come to the movie and we can meet afterward to talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Meetup date is changed to Thursday!!!&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet to practice speaking English. Bring your grammar questions, or any books you think are helpful. We'll start with introductions or an icebreaker...activity to be decided later.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1123170083000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1119481747000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The (Thursday)Boston English as a Second Language July Meetup</name><id>4725826</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1122588000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/4725826/</event_url></item>
