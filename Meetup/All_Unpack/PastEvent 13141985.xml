The Ocean State Dragon Boat team will be practicing on Wednesdays, 5:30-6:40 and Saturdays, 4:00-5:30 PM - practices will begin and end promptly! Indoor pool practice cost a measly $5 per practice and if it's your first time it's FREE.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry if your not in tip-top shape. We only ask that you try your best and do what you can do. We will train you and instruct you on the proper paddling technique. I will promise you that you will only get encouragement from everyone. Hey, we all started as a novice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your interested in learning about this exciting sport please come down and check us out. This sport is filled with exciting racing and great people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drop us an e-mail at info@oceanstatedragons.org. this lets us know how many people to expect at practice. You can park behind the JCC and use the back entrance. Meet us down at the pool area. You can't miss us, we'll be the people paddling along side the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing old and new members at practice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paddle on!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos Costa  &lt;br /&gt;Assistant Director  &lt;br /&gt;Ocean State Dragon Boat Club &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at the pool location.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carlos Costa</member_name><member_id>10120700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271708063000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Dragonboat Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ocean-State-Dragon-Boat</urlname><id>1501194</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Ocean State Dragon Boat</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270906118000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indoor Pool Practice</name><id>13141985</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271534400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ocean-State-Dragon-Boat/events/13141985/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/4/3/global_10087347.jpeg</photo_url></item>
