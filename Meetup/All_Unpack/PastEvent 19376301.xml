There are three concerts throughout the day starting at noon - I have introduced Snatam to many of you and she is the last concert at 7pm. Tickets just for the entire day are $108 or just $50 for the evening concert with Snatam. Please ocme show your support and spread the love frequency out to the world....in a time when it is needed most!

SNATAM KAUR, DAVID NEWMAN (DURGA DAS) AND EDDY NATARAJ WILL ALL BE CONTRIBUTING TO A DAY OF MUSIC, MANTRAS AND MEDITATIONS. &lt;br /&gt;COME CREATE PEACE WITHIN YOUR SELF AND LET GO EVEN IF IT IS FOR JUST A DAY.
