The last screening alot forgot to call my cellphone number and said where was I.  Call my cell# 6174358177 once you get in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just over heard other huge groups are going to come together as one, so please get there early. I will not be responsible becuase you live across the street and you left 2 minutes before 7pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There's almost 100 people going + guests. The room only fits about 150 seats. So whats the odds you getting inside? Think about that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't mind waiting there 3 hours early. It's a first come first serve and if you call me . I'll rsvp seats for everyone who actually calls me and says there 5 minutes from the theater&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/push/trailer" target="_blank"&gt;PUSH - Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to call me so I can save you all seats there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Windsor &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;617-435-8177&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s  I always wear a dark blue cap that has the initials JP (in red) not hard to look for when hardly anyone wears the cap I'm wearing unless they workout at Mikes Fitness in JP&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting in line because there will be a massive line.
