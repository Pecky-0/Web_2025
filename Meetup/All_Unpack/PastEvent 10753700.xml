<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is an all day event (and probably the next day too)- come when you can - leave when you want.  Bring those long game you never get to play, or those hard core games you can never find players for.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen every combination of games being played at once, but here is a common time line for those who have limited time that day:&lt;br /&gt;1 - 3pm  Quick easy games until 4 or 5 people are present.&lt;br /&gt;3 - 5ish  Common games that are best with 4 players with a second game of something quick and easy for the trickle of people coming in.  A second longer game will start when there are enough people; it's usually something new that everyone has to be taught.&lt;br /&gt;5 - 8 or so  One party or casual game and one more difficult game for the hard core gamers.  Often a 3rd game is needed at this time as well.&lt;br /&gt;8 - 10  Same mix as before but the people who need to leave early have gone, and the late arrivals have taken there place.&lt;br /&gt;10 - 12  Most of the casual gamers have gone, but there are still usually 2 games going on.&lt;br /&gt;12 - 2  People riding the T who haven't been offered a ride or decided to stay all night have left.  One large game or two smaller games are being played.&lt;br /&gt;2 - 7  The stalwarts play one game after another until some time after the T starts back up.&lt;br /&gt;7 - whenever  Those in it for the long haul keep going (last event went for 31 hours).&lt;br /&gt;Any time Sunday people who know what my events are like may call to see if we are still going.  People arriving or coming back on Sunday are very welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call if you want to know how many people are here or what's being played.  Ben 617-997-3545. I'll turn my phone off when I go to bed so feel free to call even if it's 4 or 5am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a snack, drink or game. I have a whole host of delivery menus if anyone wants to order, but there may not be a group dinner time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seating for 12 at a time, but room for more around the tables if you want to bring a chair. Give me a call if you want to know how full the place is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live right on the B line. Walking distance from the C and D. Easy parking on Comm. Ave. during the day, not so much at night, but I can help you find parking if you call. Resident only parking on my street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you need directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: These events are quite variable. The first one had a lot of food but fewer games; people arrived and left throughout the day (21 people peak of 13). The second had a ton of games and less snacks; people arrived throughout the day, but left mostly at the end of the day (13 people peak of 12). I provide some food and more games, but I like the randomness of leaving things up to chance.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Warmus</member_name><member_id>5401423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>20</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248306900000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246214049000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come any time, stay as long as you want</name><id>10753700</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247936400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/10753700/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
