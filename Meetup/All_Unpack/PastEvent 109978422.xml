We will honor the rebirth taking place in nature as well as ourselves using the labyrinth to guide us in awakening more of who we are and blessing life within us &amp;amp; all around us. Fee: Love Offering. The Labyrinth is in the back of St. Paul's at 166 High St. in Newburyport. The entrance is on Summer St. Parking is on the Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our time at St. Paul's, please join us at Panera Bread at 55 Storey Ave, in Newburyport for some social time and discussion of what got ignited for you during our sacred gathering and/or feel free to bring a creative expression of what Spring means to you (through a reading, poem, art, ect.) to share with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
