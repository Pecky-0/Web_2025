However, this isn't a teenage garage band attacking the classic punk rock songbook -- the Young@Heart Chorus is comprised of 22 senior citizens whose average age is 80, and under director Bob Cilman they've gained a degree of fame for their enthusiastic a cappella renditions of well-known rock &amp;amp; roll tunes. Filmmaker Stephen Walker spent several weeks with the members of the Young@Heart Chorus as they rehearsed for their annual concert in Northampton, and Young@Heart is a documentary which offers a look at their rigorous rehearsal process, the background of several members, and their efforts to stay active and think positive, even as their friends succumb to old age. Produced for British television, Young@Heart was screened in competition at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen the previews for it a couple of times and it looks like a great film.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critic reviews: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Not only is it enjoyable, Young@Heart is a heartening and poignant affirmation of the transformative power of music.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;USA Today&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Claudia Puig&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...an irresistibly joyous, tearful and, most importantly, musical doc about a band of senior pop singers...&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Variety&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- John Anderson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the movie website:  &lt;a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/youngatheart/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/youngatheart/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.foxsearchl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll go down the street to the Chowder Pot for a bite.
