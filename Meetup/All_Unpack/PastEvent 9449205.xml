In the course of the 90-minute show, the eight performers make music with dustpans, rusty metal signs, ladders, folding chairs, boxes of kitchen matches, paper bags, garbage cans, oil drums and yes, even a quartet of kitchen sinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds pretty crazy and interesting, huh? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a show on Saturday, Febr. 21st at 5 p.m., which I personally would prefer. Afterwards we could go out for a dinner and few drinks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another possibility is to go to a show on Sunday, Febr. 22nd either at 1 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. Let me know if this would work better for you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets range from $ 28 to $ 50. I would opt for the least expensive ones, but let me know your thoughts on that too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets probably run out fast, so it would be great if you could rsvp by January 14th, if you are interested or not! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and have a great week! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in front of the theatre waving a German Flag!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235427045000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231174401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lets hear some noise!!!!!!!</name><id>9449205</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235253600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/9449205/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
