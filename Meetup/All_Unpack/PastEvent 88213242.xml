&lt;p&gt;A friend who hosts another meetup group scheduled a party and so far, he is the only man attending. Of course, I noticed! Sooooo....I told him what a fun group of peeps we have in this group and offered to cross post it. He is graciously opening his home on the East side for the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes you must wear costumes! It doesn't have to be elaborate, but have some fun with it...that's what we're all about. Please give us an idea of what kind of food you'll be bringing in your response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Address is on the meetup announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
