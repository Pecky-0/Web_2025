<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Our topic this month is the use of the pearl as a symbol in Gnosticism.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many ancient texts use the pearl as a symbol for Gnosis, among other things. Both ancient Gnostic and canonical Christian sources talk about the pearl, now it's our turn! I will be uploading a file to the files section later today that gives us a good starting point for discussion, but feel free to come with your own ideas. So check the files section to the left, the file will be called &amp;quot;February 2008 discussion&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also try some guided meditation or maybe some centering prayer around the theme of the pearl. We'll get a consensus of what we should try once we all get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need a volunteer to pick up some coffee, email me (link on the left) if you can help with that. As always, if you have any questions or comments feel free to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come to the back door of the church (red brick church) and we'll be in the first room on your left.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
