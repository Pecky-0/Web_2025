Admission is $7.00 which includes a roller skate rental. If you want to rent inline skates it's $3.00 extra. You can also bring your own skates.  I've scheduled this from 6-8:00 p.m. because the next day is a holiday so they are open later.  Usually on these occasions there are less children later in the evening.  If people are interested, we can get something to eat afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always try to organized T-accessible events and even though this is in Saugus there is a bus route that travels nearby. You can log onto www.mbta.com and use the address above for details.  It's Sunday so the bus may not run often so if people want to try to carpool RSVP &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; and put it in your comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you driving, it's on the south bound side of Route 1 behind Honey Baked Hams. If you miss that entrance from Route 1 you can also reach the parking lot from the KFC or Taco Bell parking lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your plans change, please update your RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside front entry way on the left</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dee</member_name><member_id>4101956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295277532000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294077947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indoor Roller Skating at Roller World</name><id>15898890</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295218800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/15898890/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/4/8/global_6844168.jpeg</photo_url></item>
