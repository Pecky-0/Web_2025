We'll meet up for dinner, a brew (or two), and a book discussion at Tommy Doyles Irish Pub-Restaurant- Kendall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the book jacket: Our conceptions of human nature affect every aspect of our lives, from the way we raise our children to the political movements we embrace. Yet just as science is bringing us into a golden age of understanding human nature, many people are hostile to the very idea. They fear that a biological understanding of the mind will be used to justify inequality, subvert social change, and dissolve personal responsibility and strip life of meaning and purpose. In The Blank Slate Pinker retraces the history that led people to view human nature as dangerous, and unsnarls the moral and political debates that have entangled the idea along the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/23/" target="_blank"&gt;Source/Link: MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Boston Atheists Table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274040806000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271629489000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book &amp; Brew(The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker Part2/Do-Over)</name><id>pzvlnynhbtb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273960800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/13218544/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
