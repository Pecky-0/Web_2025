They&amp;rsquo;ll share with us their vivid impressions of experiences all along the way, punctuated by a choice selection of a few favorite photographs among the thousands they brought back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with thirty minutes of coffee and conversation at 7:30 p.m. The talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326829316000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323309919000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting: Our Pilgrimage To La Belle France</name><id>43772892</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326760200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/43772892/</event_url></item>
