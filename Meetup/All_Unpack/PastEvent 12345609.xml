It sounds different and it is, but it's a great workout. Come paddle with Living Root Dragon Boat, a non-profit, co-ed, competitive dragon boat team as we train during the off-season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will hold practice at the public swimming pool at the JFK Elementary School in Somerville (5 Cherry St., near Porter Square). Practice starts poolside at 9am and lasts 1 hour. It will include a warm-up, paddling, one-on-one training with our coaching staff, and more paddling. Wear gym clothes or something you normally exercise in, and bring a water bottle. Although we won't go swimming, you will get wet paddling, so bring a change of clothes.  There is a locker room where you can store your belongings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entrance to the pool is in the rear of the JFK Elementary School. Walk past the basketball courts, climb a set of stairs, and you'll see the clearly marked entrance. The pool is on the ground floor. Proceed through the locker rooms to get to the pool itself, where you'll find us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions? Send me an email through the meetup page or to info@livingroot.org.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306933093000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddle-boston</urlname><id>1135553</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Living Root Dragon Boat - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263764773000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indoor Paddling Session</name><id>12345609</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267279200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddle-boston/events/12345609/</event_url></item>
