Hamilton Woods is abundant with a variety of fungi and a beautiful place for a hunt. The paths are user friendly and the scenery is georgous. Hamilton Woods is located at 275 Chebacco Rd in South Hamilton, off route 22. Meeting time at the head of the trail will be 10:30 am. Bring your basket, and some bug spray and lunch. We will meet at the head of the trail, hunt until 12:30, and meet back at the parking area to display and talk about our finds. Pray for good weather. See you there!!
