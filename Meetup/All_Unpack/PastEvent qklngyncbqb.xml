We are going to try something a little different in January.  The Wood-n-Tap has been a good meeting spot, but the group discussed trying something new for the next meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time we will be meeting at &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;P. F. Chang's&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in West Hartford at Westfarms mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume that everyone knows how to get to Westfarms mall, but might not know where P.F. Chang's is located from within the mall.  I will have my blackberry if you run into any trouble and you can contact me at 860.416.4444 or call the restaurant directly before you arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are already a good number of RSVP's for the next meeting so I am going to call ahead of time to make sure that we have some space available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing you all there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions contact me: my email is dmassicotte@premierexpress.net &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dale Massicotte</member_name><member_id>5951349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263409986000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Russian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordrussianmeetup</urlname><id>723352</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Russian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260320660000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Russian Language January Meetup</name><id>qklngyncbqb</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263340800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordrussianmeetup/events/12048086/</event_url></item>
