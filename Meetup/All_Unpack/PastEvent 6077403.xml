A reception will follow, where the poets will sign their books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cliff Forshaw lives in Hull, England, where he teaches at the university. He has been a Hawthornden Writing Fellow, winner of the Welsh Academy John Tripp Award, and Hydro-Tasmania International Writer-in-Residence at Hobart. His latest collection, Trans (The Collective Press, Wales, 2005) includes an updating of Ovid's Metamorphoses. He is working on a new book set in Tasmania and recently co-edited (with David Kennedy) Fulcrum magazine's forthcoming supplement on Poetry and Myth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katia Kapovich hails from Soviet Moldova. Her membership in a samizdat dissident group precluded publication of her writing in the USSR. She worked on archeological digs, gauged petroleum tanks, smuggled sheepskins, then emigrated, settling in the US in 1992. The author of six Russian collections and one previous volume of English verse, Gogol in Rome (Salt, 2004), she lives in Boston and co-edits FULCRUM: an annual of poetry and aesthetics.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187994795000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185408165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Poetry Field Trip: Forshaw &amp; Kapovich in Harvard Square</name><id>6077403</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187821800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/6077403/</event_url></item>
