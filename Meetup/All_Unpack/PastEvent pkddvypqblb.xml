<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a suggestion from a member&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;we're going to take a look into the new storyboarding feature available in iOS 5.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storyboards are, quoting from Apple:&amp;nbsp;"Created for apps that use navigation and tab bars to transition between views, Storyboards eases the development by managing the view controllers for you. You can specify the transitions and segues that are used when switching between views without having to code them by hand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've put it to use you're invited to share your experiences and frustrations. The intent is to provide an introduction and show the feature in action, solve problems, and discuss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will be over by 8:30 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to see you then,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;p.s.&amp;nbsp;Have something you'd like to share with the group, like an app you're working on or have published? or a particular framework you've been able to master? &amp;nbsp;If so: Please contact me and we can put it on the schedule for a future meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
