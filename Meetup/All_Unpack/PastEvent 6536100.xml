The October meetup was very relaxed and friendly, and we had several new members.  The food and drinks are affordable and there's plenty of room for us.  We had such a nice time and everyone went home with a full belly and new friends. Eventually I'd like to alternate monthly Tues and Thurs (to accomodate those with custody days) but for now, I only have Thursday nights off.  Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;debbie&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195344373000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192187676000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston/Burbs/Metrowest Divorce November Meetup</name><id>6536100</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195171200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6536100/</event_url></item>
