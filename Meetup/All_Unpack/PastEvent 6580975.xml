If you have time tonight, please RSVP. It will be a great time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring 1 or two egg crates and 2 poles (wood poles, ski poles, hiking poles, etc) and water!    If you don't have egg crates we can also use the stone benches and walls.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tara</member_name><member_id>4521773</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542418000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192820200000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dry land ski training - Waltham</name><id>6580975</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193349600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/6580975/</event_url></item>
