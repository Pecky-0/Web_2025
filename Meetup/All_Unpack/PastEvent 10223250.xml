It's a new chance for folks to join in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discuss Role-Playing Games Design and Theory, talk about specific homebrews in the works by our members. Probably only of interest to a few, at least judging by the last time we had an event like this last fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm trying to decide if it makes sense to split this type of activity into a different meetup group.&lt;br /&gt;A temporary one has been setup as the Game Designer's Guild, where this event is posted as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Game-Designer-Guild/calendar/10066624/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to weigh in if it make sense please voice your opinion in the follow poll:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://meetup.rpfgb.org/polls/182274/"&gt;http://meetup.rpfgb.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christian Loidl</member_name><member_id>1035154</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242673932000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240201311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Designers Guild Spring Meetup</name><id>10223250</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242500400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/10223250/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/global_3081279.jpeg</photo_url></item>
