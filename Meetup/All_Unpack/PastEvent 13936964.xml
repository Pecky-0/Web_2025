They get stolen too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF USING MY YAKS YOU CANT LOOK LIKE A BONEHEADED BEGINNER AND STEP INTO THEM VIA THE FLOOR (yes the lightest kayaks have thin fiberglass or wood and your feet will go through them) OR DRIVE UP ON SHORE WITH THEM LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO A DRIVE IN MOVIE. ( In an 18 foot long boat you will still be 10 or so feet out in the water at a greater depth.) Only Novices in short wide cheap plastic boats do that kind of thing.  :-)~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INFO ON THE FOLLOWING LINK: I will also show you the correct way and you will look like a intelligent seasoned pro and impress the others who don't know how.
