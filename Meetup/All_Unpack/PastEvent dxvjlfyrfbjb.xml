We are a weekly business to business networking group looking to build relationships with like minded business owners and professionals. We are driven by the idea of building relationships with each other so we can exchange referrals and clients. This is not your typical business networking meeting. In order to attend you must derive at least 80% of your business from other businesses. We are industry exclusive so reserve your seat at the table before your competition does.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Piper Turgeon</member_name><member_id>12577782</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362584970000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Success Teammates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Business-Strategy-and-Networking-Gold-Star-Boston</urlname><id>1447978</id><group_lat>42.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Gold Star Referral Clubs - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1361390346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Queen City B2B Networking</name><id>dxvjlfyrfbjb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362573900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Business-Strategy-and-Networking-Gold-Star-Boston/events/106862372/</event_url></item>
