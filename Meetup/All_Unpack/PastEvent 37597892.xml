Neither custody nor age of your child or children is a factor in eligibility. If you are considering membership in our chapter, you must attend an Informational Meeting/Orientation. If you decide to join, yearly membership is $50.00, payable by cash or check at Informational Meeting/Orientation. Also, please bring the name, address, and telephone number of a professional person (or a sponsoring PWP member) who can verify that you are a single parent. You are welcome to stay after the orientation to meet members and join in on the discussion.&amp;nbsp; [url=www.pwp817.com]Parents Without Partners[/url]&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>"From side street, Harlow Court, enter at side door near the back of the church.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandi</member_name><member_id>8198815</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322010584000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Single Parents</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pwp817</urlname><id>1298426</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Parents Without Partners- Single Parents</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318794002000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Informational meeting - Parents Without Partners - ALL WELCOME</name><id>37597892</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322006400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pwp817/events/37597892/</event_url></item>
