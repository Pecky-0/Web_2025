And for the adventuresome--Do you dare to try their specialities made from tripe or goat meat? I heard great food comes out of Goal International. Who knows, maybe there will be a good game of soccer (football) that night... Alcohol beverages on site and street parking is easily available. (Also available parking across the street in the parking lot for merchants of Franklin Ave.)&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE don't forget to bring enough cash so splitting the bill will be easier. &lt;br /&gt;Mucho Gracias and see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST A REMINDER: The restaurant is closed on Mondays so I need to confirm by July 26th, Sunday evening. If you are not coming please kindly let me know. There were some people who were interested but could not get a spot. Thanks for the overwhelming response and look forward to seeing you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the larger table with hungry ethnic dining enthusiasts!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Audrey</member_name><member_id>5796395</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1250119729000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247440011000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Goal International Restaurant (Peruvian Cuisine)</name><id>10860642</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248908400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/10860642/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
