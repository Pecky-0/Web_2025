&lt;p&gt;Artist Statement: I walking through a building supply store and a display of rope light caught my eye, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it used many times before, to light deck rails and under bars, but this was different. &amp;nbsp;I just finished doing a fashion shoot and when I saw the rope light an idea just popped into my head. &amp;nbsp;Why not combine the rope light with a model. &amp;nbsp;So the experiment of shooting lights began. &amp;nbsp;I dressed the model with the rope light, turned off the studio lights and began experimenting with model movement, shutter speed, exposure and zooming the lens while the shutter was open. &amp;nbsp;The concept was to create fashion forms without showing the apparel. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve been shooting fashion and beauty for most of my life so commercial advertising photography is second nature. This is a new path, shooting as though it&amp;rsquo;s a fashion shoot but creating art, not an ad campaign. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly exciting to watch the image appear on the monitor in an otherwise dark studio. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;m now experimenting with different types of light that can be attached to a model and giving the model more freedom in movement. &amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s like a dance of light. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron is represented by Canvas Fine Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
