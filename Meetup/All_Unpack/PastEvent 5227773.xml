If you've been to a Sierra Club &amp;amp; Beer night, this is a great opportunity to meet some of the leaders and activists from around the state. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll supply snacks and beverages - plus lots of literature about the projects we're planning for 2007 and ways you can get involved in helping protect the environment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a free event. The Sierra Club office is fully accessible, located just a few yards from the MBTA's Boylston Street station. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come anytime from 4-7pm!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mass Sierra</member_name><member_id>3278292</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1166303113000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Environmental Activists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Sierra-Club</urlname><id>229402</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Sierra Club Environmental Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1161996395000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sierra Club Holiday Party!</name><id>5227773</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1166130000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Sierra-Club/events/5227773/</event_url></item>
