As a result, Catherine now plans to open the Button Box, but at its regular time, noon, rather than at 10 a.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt; So right now, the Meetup is ON, but won't start until NOON.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; If we have any new members, we'll do orientation at 1 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll bring a hot pot and a really nice selection of black, herbal and Chai teas, so there will be something to warm your bones once you arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Catherine warns that the parking lot *may* not be plowed until afternoon, so if we do end up with a lot of snow, you may want to keep that in mind when considering how much stuff to bring. (If necessary, we can use the parking lot at the office building next door, which is closed on Sundays.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, if the weather's iffy but the Meetup is on, use your own good judgment about whether and when to travel. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;And to be on the safe side, check here (and your e-mail box) for messages one more time before you head out on Sunday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
