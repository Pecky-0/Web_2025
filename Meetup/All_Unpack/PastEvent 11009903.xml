Aerobic Fitness, Muscular Strength and Endurance, Flexibility and Body Composition are what will be tested and measured.  This is a great way for each of us to assess our individual current fitness levels and to set realistic goals that can be measured and attained.  Ideally we plan to run this event quarterly, or roughly every 3 months.  This way we can measure our success and other members can join us as their schedule allows and as they join the Group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a perfect opportunity to burn a few calories, assess your fitness level and meetup with other Group Members.  In addition, this is a great event for first-time attendees (new members!) to attend.  Whether this is your 1st, 2nd or 3rd time participating in the PFC Assessment this is sure to be a fun and enlightening event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What To Wear: Workout Clothes, Sneakers, Sunscreen &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Bring: Data Collection Form, Pen, Water, Hat, Sunglasses, Beach Towel or Bath Towel &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have formed a Group to take the President's Challenge together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is it?  The President's Challenge is a series of programs designed to help improve anyone's activity level. Joining a group is a great way to make staying active easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about the President's Challenge, go to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.PresidentsChallenge.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.Presidents...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why join?  Staying active with others can be a lot of fun. They'll help keep you motivated - even when you don't really feel like it. Groups are a great way to meet new people. There are even programs for people at different activity levels: the Active Lifestyle program aimed at beginners, and the Presidential Champions program for those who are already active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signing up for a group is simple. And there's no limit to how many you can belong to. You can join or leave at any time. All you have to do is register.
