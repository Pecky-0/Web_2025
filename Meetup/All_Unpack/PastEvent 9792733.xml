<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Brunch and Skiing was mentioned to me the other night. So without delay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, March 21st: Our First Brunch and Skiing event at Wachusett Mountain. Winter is coming to an end. So this is timely and should be a lot of fun! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can drive 3 others up/possibly 4. I will be renting skies so feel free to do the same.  I don't have a ski rack either, sorry... :( Depending on how many people are interested, I'll be looking for other drivers. Hopefully... with a ski rack if people plan to bring their own skies :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Departure time is TBD. That's because we have options. We can get an early start, and ski during the day. Or, we can leave later and ski at night. I'm flexible but leaning... towards doing the night skiing. It's been awhile. With that said, though, I'm open to doing either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please send along your thoughts/ideas and any recommendations and questions that you may have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP first</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237832650000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235263555000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch and Night Skiing at Wachusett MT </name><id>9792733</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237658400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9792733/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/d/global_7605629.jpeg</photo_url></item>
