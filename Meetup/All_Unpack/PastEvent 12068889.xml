We'll listen to Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Van Morrison, Paul Simon, Johnny Cash, Elvis, The Doors and The Rolling Stones…&lt;br /&gt;…..and of course a touch of Sinatra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sit together for the evening, we need to reserve a table of 10. &lt;br /&gt;We start our evening at 7pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular dinner menu will be offered to us at their usual prices. Cash bar and dinner costs are on your own. Our Boston Baby Boomer cost for a ticket is $35.00. It includes: entrance fee, live music, party favors, champagne toast, and passed hot and cold O'dourves all evening long. (we may need a snack before midnight). First 10 PAID &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVP's will have a guaranteed ticket. We will start a wait list for another group if needed. So, if you'd like to attend, hit the PayPal with a $10 reservation fee. They will take $25 at the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt; - Dec 26th&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently we have 8 paid reservations and we will stop with a table of ten. &lt;br /&gt;Lucky's is sold out for the evening and I've been told that we need to pay in full before Monday to hold our table.  If you haven't RSVP'd yet, hit the PayPal with $38.75 before Monday to secure your ticket.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7792036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1262477612000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260586609000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Years Eve at Lucky's</name><id>12068889</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262304000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/12068889/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/b/global_12187707.jpeg</photo_url></item>
