Many of us take our education for granted, but there are lots of Bostonians struggling to advance their economic circumstances because they did not have the opportunity to finish their education. The United South End Settlement helps adults get the educational foundation they need to succeed - but they really need you to help the students succeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will spend about two hours teaching Bostonians basic English and Math skills. Helping them prepare for and pass their GEDs. Helping them better their lives. Afterwards, we can regroup over some food and drinks! This meetup will be held monthly on the first Thursday of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week before the meetup happens, I will send along the volunteer application and some additional information to those who have signed up. Please be sure to only sign up for this if you can give at least 72 hours notice that you will cancel - we want to make sure we have enough volunteers in attendance to serve the students!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lives by our philosophy "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." I hope you can join!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
