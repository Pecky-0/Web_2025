Cabaret, jazz, torch songs and show tunes are typical for these evenings, but other reasonable genres include pop, soul, folk, soft rock, ballads, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to belt out a song or two, or just come to watch and support all levels of performers, please join us at this very friendly and fun evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admission is $10/$13/$7 (members/singers/audience). Where else in Boston can you get so much entertainment for such a low price? *You may want to inquire about BACA's $40 annual membership for cost savings on events as well as other wonderful benefits!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign-ups to sing and the show begins at 7pm (the earlier you arrive, the more of a chance you can sing two songs!). Also, in order to sing, you will need to bring sheet music so the pianist can accompany you, optimally in your key.&lt;/p&gt;
