 Jeff Pitchell with Texas Flood and special guest guitarist Johnny A &lt;br /&gt;

 Jeff Pitchell is an internationally acclaimed dynamic singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor. Jeff achieved national recognition when his last CD, Heavy Hitter (Pyramid Records/EMI) reached #7 on the Billboard Charts, selling more CDs than Delbert McClinton, Robert Cray, Etta James, Johnny Lee Hooker &amp;amp; Muddy Waters. Jeff has recorded with such greats as Rick Derringer, Dave Mason, James Cotton and Clarence Clemons. Jeff received international recognition when he toured Europe and then was asked to join the Commitments as a special guest. &lt;br /&gt;

 Texas Flood consists of Jimmie Biggins on sax (formerly with James Taylor and The Temptations), Marty Richards on drums (drummer for J Geils Band, Joe Perry's Band, and Peter Wolf's Band), Dave Natale on bass, Dan Fontanella B3 Organ. These seasoned musicians unite to bring a high energy mix of Rhythm and Blues, Rock Soul, Pop and funky Texas Blues &lt;br /&gt;

 Johnny A has one of the most eloquent voices in modern music - and he doesn't sing a note. Instead, he channels joy, love, humor, sadness... every aspect of the human experience, through his guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
