What about good writing? Is it really just taste, or is there writing that everyone can agree earns our love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge: Bring a &lt;b&gt;short&lt;/b&gt; sample of writing you think is wonderful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00 Names. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: What's so great about that?&lt;br /&gt;Read your sample and let's see if we can figure out what makes it work and what parts of it fall flat. Don't be surprised if everyone has a different answer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;**Please reserve off-topic discussion for after the break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218572060000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215896947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers August Meetup</name><id>8328664</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218398400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/8328664/</event_url></item>
