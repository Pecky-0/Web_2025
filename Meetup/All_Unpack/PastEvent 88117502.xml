He found out that various practices he encountered were not the right way, so that he decided to meditate under a tree at Gaya. After seven days of meditation, in the early morning of December 8, the prince gained Enlightenment and became the Buddha, the Enlightened One. The Jodo-e service is held to commemorate the event of the historical Buddha gaining Enlightenment here in this world. Everyone is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a simple service held more like a Family Service. Please come and help decorate the Bodhi tree ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
