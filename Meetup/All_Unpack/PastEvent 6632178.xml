By day I taught accounting, business law , math, and psychology at a vocational business school in Brooklyn, New York. By night I began the long haul of performing at &amp;quot;open mic&amp;quot; clubs learning to make people laugh. In 1999 I was picking up my dry cleaning and the &amp;quot;grandmotherly&amp;quot; woman handing me my cleaned shirt smiled and scolded me &amp;quot;behave!&amp;quot; And thats when it hit me. That was it. People love when I don't behave. I got on stage and began announcing &amp;quot;I'm not here to behave&amp;quot; and I started being honest about sex, ethnicity, my love life, the lack of respect for education, intelligence, minorities, women...even men. Yes men are direspected too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.CTNites.com/Events/FunnyBone.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Click Here For Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542478000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Entertainment CT VIP Clubbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Entertainment-CT</urlname><id>530639</id><group_lat>41.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club Music Theatre Golf Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193589926000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wacky Wednesday At The Funny Bone Comedy Club</name><id>6632178</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193869800000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Entertainment-CT/events/6632178/</event_url></item>
