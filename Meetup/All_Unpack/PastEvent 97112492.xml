&lt;p&gt;The facility is friendly, they have lessons to get you started – and it isn’t expensive – a day pass is $18 and a full equipment rental is $10.  The first session is $40 all-in and includes an instructional course on handling the rope, knot tying, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATTENDEES: Once you sign up here call Metro Rock at &lt;span&gt;617–387–ROCK (7625) and schedule yourself for the Sunday morning class.  Tell them you are part of a meetup group and mention my name and that I am a member.  They will take a credit card to secure a spot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are certain to leave with a great feeling and tired forearms.  Get the Jello out of those legs snd start climbing the wall...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
