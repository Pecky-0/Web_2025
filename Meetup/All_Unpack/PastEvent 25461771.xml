&lt;p&gt;The Forest Hills Lantern Festival is an peaceful, fun and inspiring event. A couple of Meetup Groups and organizers will already be there. This could be a great opportunity to get to know people better. The main focus is hanging out and getting to know each other. Finer details about planning this group and Meetup in general will be discussed another time.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;There are two official meeting spots. The first spot is inside the building on the surface level of the Forest Hills T Stop right under the clock tower. I encourage you to arrive at 5:45pm as we leave at 6:00pm sharp. At 6:15pm we meet those who preferred to drive to the cemetery at the main/official entrance. Walking in a free but parking is $10. Please be there by 6:00pm as we leave at 6:15pm sharp. For those that are late &amp;ndash; we usually hang out at the southern end of the stage (arriving by 6:30pm). I will provide my cell phone for those who RSVP Yes by Thursday morning.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Again, this an awesome event that usually gets several groups to attend. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful way to spend a summer evening and get to know each other. Below is a description of the event from Forest Hills:

 &lt;br /&gt;** Description from the Forest Hills Educational Trust **
 &lt;br /&gt;Our memorial Lantern Floating Festival is inspired by an ancient Buddhist ritual in which lanterns representing the souls of the dead are floated out to sea and prayers are offered so that they may rest in peace. Join us for this beautiful ceremony. Inscribe your own words of remembrance and hope on the shades of simple wooden lanterns, and then release them, glimmering with candlelight, onto Lake Hibiscus at dusk.
 &lt;br /&gt;Many people attend with friends and family, spreading out a blanket for a picnic dinner, and then working on commemorative lanterns. The evening starts with performances of drumming, dance, and choral music. Hear the dynamic Master Tsuji's Samurai Taiko Drummers and spirited music by Ron Murphy and Friends, some of Boston's finest gospel singers. Enjoy traditional Japanese Bon Festival dances presented in elegant kimona clad students from Showa Boston Institute and traditional Chinese folk dance by youth from Chu Ling Dance Academy. The haunting sounds of Japanese flute, followed by Scottish bagpipes, accompany the lanterns on their journey across the Lake
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Please note: bring a flashlight to help guide your exit from the Cemetery, as there is no electrical lighting after dark.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310709857000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Organizers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NEOrganizers</urlname><id>321127</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>New England Meetup Organizers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1310484940000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forest Hills Lantern Festival</name><id>25461771</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310680800000</time><rsvp_limit>250</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NEOrganizers/events/25461771/</event_url></item>
