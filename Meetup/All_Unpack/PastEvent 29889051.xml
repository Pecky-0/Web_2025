We were a little tight on space so we've upgraded our venue. SO BRING A FRIEND THIS TIME, preferably an undecided one. Please join us at upstairs at the BLACK ROSE on Wednesday, September 7 to watch the fourth GOP primary debate of the presidential cycle. The debate being hosted by NBC/Politico/ Reagan Library and will take place in Simi Valley, CA. At the time of this posting, the following candidates have confirmed that they will be at the debate: Cain, Johnson, Romney, and Santorum. It's safe to expect Bachmann, Gingrich, and RON PAUL will join them, maybe even Hunstman, McCotter, and/or Perry. The debate is scheduled to start at 8PM EST. We have the upstairs reserved from 7:30-11. Stay tuned; we're going to find out which local garages if any Black Rose validates parking for.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1315442696000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1313616557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Debate-Watching Party</name><id>29889051</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315438200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/29889051/</event_url></item>
