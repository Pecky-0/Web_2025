How do you learn from what you read? Do you go back and try to understand how your favorite author keeps you up all night? Do you reread a book over and over again? Do you try writing a pastiche? Do you type in a favorite passage so you can learn how every word works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely, it's just as useful to analyze books you *don't* like. What are the flaws that drive you crazy? How do you make sure you're not doing the same thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also&lt;br /&gt;Book / Magazine Exchange &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another followup. Kathleen had a great idea: bringing some books to the Meetup. I know I have some books to pass along. And some recent issues of magazines and small press that I bought to see if I could write for them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's do some trading!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184616465000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181509408000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction Writers July Meetup</name><id>5876210</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184443200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/5876210/</event_url></item>
