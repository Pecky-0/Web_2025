<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Over the last year, this Meetup group has really taken off and become a wonderful treat for us.  We'd like to celebrate the group's first anniversary by getting together for some outdoor games.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last Meetup on the Common went beautifully, so hopefully we'll have a repeat.  We're crossing our fingers for good weather.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us on Salem Common with all of your outdoor games.  We'll be bringing badminton, bocce ball, and some two-player games.  Hopefully we'll have some volunteers with horseshoes, croquet, etc.  Also, feel free to bring blankets and chairs and something to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, should you wish, we can go out to dinner to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the Salem Board Games Meetup.  (While a little later than Aug. 19, our group and its members certainly deserve to be celebrated.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet near the Washington arch on the north-east side of the Common.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220984928000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219456819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Anniversary Afternoon on the Common</name><id>8602266</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220810400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/8602266/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/0/global_3903920.jpeg</photo_url></item>
