According to the website, there will be free live Jazz, Folk, Latin and World music bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The festival is between Harvard and Central Squares on Memorial Drive.  Take the T to Harvard Square and walk about 5 to 10 minutes to Memorial Drive.  It's between JFK Street and Western Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to bring a beach towel or blanket to relax on while listening to music and a little bit of cash for food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The festival is from 12 noon to 6pm, rain or shine; however, I may not stay the entire time and I definitely won't go if it's raining.  The weather forecast, so far, looks beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the following website for more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cambridgema.gov/cac/community_river.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cambridgem...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll email my cell phone # to the people who reply either yes or maybe on Friday the 13th, so reply either yes or maybe before Friday the 13th to get my cell phone #.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>2969721</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213641957000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>To hang out at the festival.</why><group><who>Fans of Live Music</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-live-music</urlname><id>444171</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Live Music</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213113871000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge River Festival</name><id>8116226</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213459200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-live-music/events/8116226/</event_url></item>
