&lt;p&gt;Let's get together for a 4 mile walk through the woods and around the pond. The trail is mostly flat with a few small hills and a small section of rocky trail. Mostly and easy walk. Lovely pond with a beach area. Wear good walking shoes, bring water and perhaps a towel for wet dogs....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet at Fisherman's Beach on Randolph St in Canton. The entrance to the parking lot is on Randolph Street, left after the temple (coming from the highway) or on the right after the horsefarm (coming from Randolph). Don't park in front of the fire gate directly across from the horsefarm, that is the AMC entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you Google or GPS this venue, Temple Beth David is at 1060 Randolph Street, Canton. The entrance to Fisherman's Beach is IMMEDIATELY after the temple hidden in the trees. There are a few lots inside the gate.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacqueline </member_name><member_id>7535746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304332650000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Sunday looks like a sunny day with temperatures in the 60's, perfect for a 4 mile walk through the woods and around the pond.</why><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304125486000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ponkapoag Pond Sunday Walk</name><id>17485788</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304276400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/17485788/</event_url></item>
