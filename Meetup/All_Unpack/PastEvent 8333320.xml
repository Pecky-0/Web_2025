This yard is HUGE, securely fenced, and always nicely mowed for the meetups.  There's shade and water and even a kiddie pool for the amphibious Pugs, and for lazier folks like your organizer - me - there's plenty of room to set up a lawn chair in the shade to sit and sip soft drinks, eat snacks, and watch the Pugs run wild.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 30 to 60 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know.  We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host, and we'd certainly like to give Shar a break every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went back to our home base in Carver for the July meetup, thanks to Shar and Ron for letting Pugs overrun their beautiful yard just about every month!  The July turnout was substantial - 38 people, 43 Pugs, and 2 French Bulldogs (mine).  Everyone had a great time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, we had quite a few new folks at the meetup, and we certainly hope they had a good time!  Be sure to let us know if it's your first time attending, and we will be happy to introduce you to the rest of the gang.  All family members are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the folks who brought the goodies for the meetup. Even though our monthly host provides the soft drinks and the paperware, we depend on our members to bring the snacks for all the pugaholics attending.  They haven't failed us yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending!  If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow.  I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either..  Thank you for your consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $72.00 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups and the South of Boston Small Breed Dogs Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend.  Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis, Cletus and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>shar</member_name><member_id>2833949</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218583772000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215976127000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug August Meetup</name><id>8333320</id><headcount>36</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218391200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/8333320/</event_url></item>
