During a few languid summer days, a young foreigner who spends his afternoons sketching in an outdoor café, arrives in the city of Strasbourg. He is looking for a woman named Sylvia who he'd met years before in the same city, but he also sketches the many attractive young women he sees, any one of which could be her. Then one fine afternoon, he thinks he's actually seen her, and sets off through the city to confront his memory. José Luis Guerín's graceful work eloquently captures the feeling of being in love with love, and the youthful sense of a world filled with limitless sensuality. In French and Spanish with English subtitles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following this is a companion film, which is about an hour and 10 minutes.  Note that a separate admission will be charged.  Some might want to see the first film only, so we'll quickly gather between films and those who aren't staying for the second can connect and go to their own discussion.  The rest of us will meet following the second and go for drinks and (short) discussion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the front of the theater with a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214780904000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213451733000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>In the City of Sylvia</name><id>8141354</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214607600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8141354/</event_url></item>
