Hear the story of how Frederick Law Olmsted set about to transform the area and the subsequent changes made to his landscape in the century that followed. The walk, led by Emerald Necklace Conservancy docents, includes stops at the Kelleher Rose Garden, a 17th-century Japanese temple bell and a historic gatehouse designed by H.H. Richardson.
