<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our agenda is to promote Barbershop Quartet and Chorus Singing and to share tips, techniques, and stuff going on, and to have fun with other members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, my Chorus, Sounds of Concord, will sponsor it and provide space, but we might consider moving to another date/time if that is more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring music that you might want to try, but we'll also have some there.  We also have learning CD's so don't feel intimidated if you are not a music reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Chorus typically goes out to dinner after rehearsals, (about 10 P.M.).  We have fun, sing a bunch, and try some new things, so for those who are late nighters, that is an option too.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Lee Daum or Dan Costello or Jim Kenealy from Sounds of Concord.  We rehearse in this location at 7:30.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lee</member_name><member_id>6728437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327885626000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singers / Brothers / Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>VocalRevolution</urlname><id>1064944</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Area Acapella Barbershop Quartet/Chorus Singing</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229044380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Area Barbershop Quartet Singing Meetup</name><id>9324461</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232064000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/VocalRevolution/events/9324461/</event_url></item>
