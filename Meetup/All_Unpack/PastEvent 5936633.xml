<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the same dungeon that will be running/ran on july 5th. This is for people who were unable to attend. I tested this dungeon out previously with another group and it didnt get very good reviews. All i have to say is that its very informative about the religions in 3.5 edition. Its a bit of a goose chase, with little action to it. Its still worth standard apl2 xp though! It will only run with 4-6 players. Any less and it cannot be done by rpga rules.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183996884000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182834483000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RPGA APL2 at Disposeable Heroes "Faith No More"</name><id>5936633</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183824000000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/5936633/</event_url></item>
