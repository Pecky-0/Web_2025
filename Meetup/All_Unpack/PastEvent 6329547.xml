After warming up we'll get a game going! Check out our About Us page for a list of game rules as well as rules we've bent to accommodate all players. Between 6:00-7:00 we'll head over to a restaurant to finish up with conversation over food and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who take public transportation, the Harvard T stop and the 66 bus stop are a couple blocks away (see the map). Parking is free on Sundays as well. Send me a note if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: We're going to alternate between Saturday and Sunday games. If you can't make it this week, look for a Saturday game next week! And keep in mind, Patriots are playing this Sunday at 8:15 so you have plenty of time to join us for flag football!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>23</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190146014000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189425999000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag Football on Cambridge Common</name><id>6329547</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189972800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6329547/</event_url></item>
