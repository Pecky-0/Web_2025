Need any other reasons to come out and join us for a fun night of dancing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 2/19/10: There is no cover charge to get into the Crescent Yacht Club all that you will have to do is sign the guest book upon entering.  The dress code is casual!  Please remember that if you plan on bringing a snack to this event then include that on your RSVP!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;About the Band&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;Don’t Call Me Shirley plays contemporary, popular, and classic hits from the 1960’s to today’s favorites. DCMS &lt;br /&gt;is a “wicked fun” band that entertains music lovers with a wide range of tastes from the folk rock of Simon and Garfunkel to the hard rock of the Rolling Stones. Shirley is a party band for the local lounge or the backyard summer blow-out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley came together in 2000 when Dave moved next door to Kevin. They started with some acoustic duo work and soon found Ron Chane because all of their kids were in the same class. That made for some rockin’ Christmas gigs in kindergarten. After adding Ron on bass the next natural progression was to grab Matt Beard who was the drummer with Kevin’s other band The Catapillars. Mark Luchini was added in 2006 bringing electric guitar for those stadium gigs we play. Mark fills in the missing notes with great leads and riffs not to mention another level of vocal ability which has Shirley is now known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;About the Venue&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crescent Yacht Club&lt;br /&gt;Crescent Yacht Club is located in Bradford (a part of Haverhill), it is a private club which offers its venue as a public space for entertainment and local bands to play.  The yacht club has a full bar but does not have food other than some munchies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our group saw Don't Call me Shirley at this venue on 12/18 and had a great time.  The band was awesome and we danced all night.  The dance floor was plenty big enough.  The drinks were very reasonably priced and the members of the club were very friendly and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the 12/18 event we found that the only downfall was that there was not food available.  So this time when we go out lets all bring some munchies with us.  Perhaps some dip/chips, cheese/crackers or some popcorn.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on bringing munchies with you please add that to your RSVP so that we don't have 20 bags of popcorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you out at the yacht club &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Organizers...we will try to get the tables in the left corner under the big screen tv</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267406835000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261354625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Don't Call Me Shirley @ Crescent Yacht Club in Bradford</name><id>12122507</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267233300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/12122507/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/5/global_12333109.jpeg</photo_url></item>
