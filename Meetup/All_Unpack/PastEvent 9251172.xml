Instead, I'm changing this to the theater listed above and the 7:30 showing.  Let's meet in the lobby no later than 7:15.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the trailer for this a few weeks ago and decided I can't miss this one.  Check it out at the link below.  The time listed is based on this week's schedule.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/synecdocheny/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/synecdocheny/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sonyclassi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the movie: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Catherine Keener, Emily Watson &lt;br /&gt;Director: Charlie Kaufman (who previously did Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, Adaptation and Being John Malkovich)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theater director Caden Cotard (Hoffman) is mounting a new play. His life catering to suburban blue-hairs at the local regional theater in Schenectady, New York is looking bleak. His wife Adele (Keener) has left him to pursue her painting in Berlin, taking their young daughter Olive (Sadie Goldstein) with her. His therapist, Madeleine Gravis (Davis), is better at plugging her best-seller than she is at counseling him. A new relationship with the alluringly candid Hazel (Morton) has prematurely run aground. And a mysterious condition is systematically shutting down each of his autonomic functions, one by one. Worried about the transience of his life, he leaves his home behind. He gathers an ensemble cast into a warehouse in New York City, hoping to create a work of brutal honesty. He directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing each to live out their constructed lives in a growing mockup of the city outside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...sprawling, awe-inspiring, heartbreaking, frustrating, hard-to-follow and achingly, achingly sad...&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Carina Chocano&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Writer/director Charlie Kaufman constructs a world seemingly worth exploring, then callously goes about destroying it.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;USA Today&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Claudia Puig&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...it's the sort of work that on its face appears overreaching and isn't entirely digestible on one viewing.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Variety&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Todd McCarthy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby by 7:15 for the 7:30 movie</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>3461529</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228753837000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228067263000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Synecdoche, New York</name><id>9251172</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228522500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/9251172/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/8/global_5165560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
