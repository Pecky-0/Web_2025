Our goal is establishing source plantings from which we can propagate plants for distribution. Once we have a supply of indigenous plants we will provide them to homeowners for yards and gardens at low or no cost. In this way we hope to preserve the MSSF and the pine barrens region of Kingston, Plymouth, Carver and Wareham. If you would like to become a part of this exciting effort, please attend the orientation meeting and walk on Sunday, September 19, 10 a.m.-1 p.m., led by FMSSF Plant Expert Irina Kadis and DCR Forester Paul Gregory. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You will choose a certain plant or two in the Forest, familiarize yourself with it, observe it flowering and fruiting,  and collect seeds from that plant(s) at the right time. No botanical/horticultural background is required. During the meeting Irina Kadis will give an overview of the propagation process and show the plants, from which seeds could be collected during this fall/winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.friendsmssf.com/pinebarrenshome.html" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about the PBCI here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. FMSSF HAS SPECIAL PERMISSION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND RECREATION DCR FOR THIS PROJECT. COLLECTING OR REMOVING OF PLANTS AND PLANT MATERIALS FROM A RESERVE IS AGAINST THE LAW AND HARMFUL TO THE FOREST. PLEASE ONLY COLLECT WITH FMSSF'S PBCI LEADERS.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285151232000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284045524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BECOME A PLANT HUNTER/GATHERER in Myles Standish State Forest!</name><id>14711106</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284904800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/14711106/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/9/global_17825417.jpeg</photo_url></item>
