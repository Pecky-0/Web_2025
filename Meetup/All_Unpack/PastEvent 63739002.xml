&lt;p&gt;Rosanne Cash is an icon of country rock whose earthy sound is both magical and real: it is gritty and powerful, yet intimate and honest. She has recorded eleven No. 1 singles, blurring the lines between country, rock, roots, and pop. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Her performance of her recent album The List—which will be presented in the open air on the closing night of the Festival—shows her considerable talent and appeal. The List is a deeply personal album: a peaen to her father, Johnny Cash. The selections and the album’s title derive from the list of 100 Essential Country Songs that her father had compiled for her and instructed her to learn when she joined his road show after high school graduation. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

American songwriter says The List is “imbued with tremendous life force.”&lt;/p&gt;
