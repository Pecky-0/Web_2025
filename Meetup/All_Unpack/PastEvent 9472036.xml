<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;**If the RSVP is full, please put yourself on the wait list, as I will be opening up more spots as the event date approaches**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy 2009!  We are excited to start the new year with our January launch event!  All members are welcome!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been many new members who have signed up for our group, and even more who are members but have yet to attend a meetup.  I would encourage everyone to come out and celebrate our January launch event, as it will be a great opportunity to meet new people and get your groove on!  &lt;b&gt;I expect a big turnout, so RSVPs will fill up quickly - don't miss it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hitting two spots on this particular Friday night:  Vox Populi and Saint.  Vox is one of the best bars in Boston, and Saint is one of my favorite lounges.  Both are upscale and classy venues, and they are located close to each another.  &lt;b&gt;This night is going to be on like Donkey Kong!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8pm at the 2nd floor bar upstairs at Vox (755 Boylston St).  &lt;b&gt;I encourage everyone to arrive early as things will get louder and more crowded as the night progresses.&lt;/b&gt;  Please look for me to find the group.  We will head over to Saint (90 Exeter St) around 10pm to beat the lines.  Please meet us at Vox, and try to get there early as to have time to meet people.  It will be tougher to find us once inside Saint.  Cover:  None for Vox, but there will be a cover for Saint, which I expect to be $10-$20 per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. &lt;b&gt;For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please dress appropriately as these are upscale venues.&lt;/b&gt;  If traveling by T, Copley is the closest T stop on the green line, and Back Bay Station is the closest on the orange line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!
