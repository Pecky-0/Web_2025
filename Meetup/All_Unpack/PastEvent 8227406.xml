The Nashua River Rail Trail is a former railroad right of way that travels 11 miles through the towns of Ayer, Groton, Pepperell and Dunstable. The trail offers a 10-foot wide paved surface for the entire length. This is about a 1.5 hour ride, not a race but hopefully a work out. After we will hit a local place for a light lunch for all those that want to. This event is about getting some form of exercise, again not a race but a steady ride, time to cool down and chat after the ride for those that want to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Take exit 5W to Rte 111A/main Dunstable Road. Take 111A/MainDunstable south past the Dunkin Donuts, 7-11 and Shell gas station on your left. Continue straight. Go past the Conant Fire station for about 3.6 miles. You will see parking along the side of Route 111A. If you pass the Hollis Town line you have gone to far. Coming from Route 111, turn on to Route 111A under a mile you will see entrance to bike path, parking along Route 111A. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/d..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216132733000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214572492000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FAN Event: Ride the Nashua River Rail Trail</name><id>8227406</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215959400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/8227406/</event_url></item>
