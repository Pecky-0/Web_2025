Open seven days a week from 7:00am to 1:00am, Sonsie boasts beautiful French doors that translate to an open sidewalk cafe in season, as well as a European lounge with deep leather chairs and sofas. The mahogany bar serves the best martinis in town from an experienced lot of friendly bartenders and the brick-oven churns out eclectic pizzas and focaccia throughout the day. It is easy to relax at Sonsie and enjoy the classic music that reflects the ambience of the restaurant as day progresses into night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chef Poirier’s menu always introduces fresh flavors and brilliant food combinations. Signature dishes dot the menu as well as seasonal dishes splashed with nightly specials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They make a mean bread pudding that is to die for!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254505267000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249684741000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Sonsie</name><id>11061277</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253746800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11061277/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/global_6726124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
