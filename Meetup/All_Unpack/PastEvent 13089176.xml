We expect between 40-45 people, men, woman and children, who have fallen on hard times and look to this program for a good hot meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be expected to show up at the Church at 2:PM, help with preparation, serving and cleanup. With that many people attending we really could use all the help we can get, and it’s a nice way to get to meet each other outside of a circle or ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider this act of service and RSVP if you are able. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her service&lt;br /&gt;Leoric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View photos of our last community meals @&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/photos/538365/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279509069000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270466661000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community meals Service</name><id>13089176</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279389600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/13089176/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
