Like me, Megan is a new docent this year with Boston By Foot and she's got a weakness for Mr. Bulfinch.  She's a pro on the &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/tours/Beacon_Hill" target="_blank"&gt;Beacon Hill tour&lt;/a&gt; and she's a damned fine storyteller.  So come join us and learn more about this fascinating neighborhood.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour starts promptly at 5:30 and lasts 90 minutes.  Please show up early to pay.  Look for Megan wearing Boston By Foot gear and me wearing my Meetup button  We'll both be on the State House steps.  The tour is $12 cash and free for &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot card-holders&lt;/a&gt; (and I know there's a bunch of us in Nerd Fun now).  After the tour, we'll all head somewhere nearby for dinner, but it won't be a late one - I have to get home and bake for a bake sale for my Breast Cancer 3-Day walk.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me wearing Meetup and Boston By Foot buttons</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252617617000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252088622000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beacon Hill with Boston By Foot - "the Bulfinch tour"</name><id>11290996</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252444500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11290996/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/b/global_2222155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
