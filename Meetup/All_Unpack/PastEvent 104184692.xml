&lt;p&gt;From a blog on the most recent visit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Plymouth Airport leg of the trip started at 12:00PM and attracted 20+ people. Once a year the club is granted access to the airfield inside the perimeter fence. This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;usually&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;increases our chances of observing grassland bird species, most notably Upland Sandpiper. Temperatures moderated into the 50sF and showers ended, but the wind was still blowing strong. Initially things were very quiet bird wise. Then Savannah Sparrows started singing and a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Grasshopper Sparrow&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;revealed itself teed-up on a small wooden stake in the distance. Nice scope views were had by all of this secretive sparrow. A couple of Horned Larks were seen and then an Eastern Meadowlark flew across the airfield and perched on the perimeter fence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, directly behind our group, someone yells, "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upland Sandpiper&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the fence"! There it was right up on the fence and not on the ground where we had been scanning for the better part of an hour. After admiring the Upland for a couple of minutes another grassland bird starts singing -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vesper Sparrow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Guess where it was, right up on the fence where we had entered the airfield! Seems like the right strategy is to "work" the fence line! Pretty much a clean sweep of grassland birds except American Kestrel. The Upland Sandpiper continued to spend a lot time on the fence, dropping to the ground occasionally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have permission from the airport manager, Tom Maher, to walk inside the second fence line in search of grassland nesting species found no where else among the barrens; such as Upland Sandpipers and Grasshopper Sparrows.&lt;/span&gt;NOTE:  It is possible, but not likely, this trip might be cancelled due to homeland security reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sorry, no dogs please.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/8/8/event_244638312.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Glenn d'Entremont</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Glenn d'Entremont</member_name><member_id>46086532</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1370704567000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360631922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Plymouth Airport Bird Walk</name><id>104184692</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1370692800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/104184692/</event_url></item>
