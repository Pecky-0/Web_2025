Waivers can be downloaded here: &lt;a href="http://www.guardup.net/sword/documents/event_waiver.doc" target="_blank"&gt;Waiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $15 for Meet Up members (and their friends) who pre-register ($20 for non). Pre-registration required as these events DO fill up and we cannot take anyone else after our capacity is reached. To pre-register you must call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead with a credit card or cash. Make sure to tell them that &amp;quot;Meghan sent you&amp;quot; so that you get the Meet Up rate which is the same as the Member Rate (a savings of $5). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: RSVP with YES does NOT PRE-REGISTER. You MUST call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead to complete the pre-registration process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At-Door is $20 and you may be turned away if there is not enough room. Since we fill up before the event more than 1/2 the time, pre-registration is highly recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to be ontime for required safety instruction at start of event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the front desk... they can help you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meghan</member_name><member_id>5106555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236985513000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230611680000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Battle Night: I Challenge You to a Duel!</name><id>9406133</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235779200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/9406133/</event_url></item>
