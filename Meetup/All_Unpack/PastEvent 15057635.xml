Bring a dish to share and the bar will be open!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind this is a private yacht club and an invitation has been extended to P-Collective members to enjoy the Sunday Pat's games in the Darby Room this season. All are welcome, and please tell them you are with the Providence Collective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post these as reminders, but may not be able to make all the games.  Bob Natale or Sue Toland will be at the club hosting the events. Also, if there is another sporting event you would like to see, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How cool is it to be on the water and watching a Patriots game with friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please RSVP so others who want to go will know you're going, and so I know whether people want to go!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Sue Toland or Bob Natale is hosting this event.
