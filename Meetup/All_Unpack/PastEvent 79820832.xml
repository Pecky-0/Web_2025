<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm hosting a game night at my place on 9/8/12. It will start at 7:00 and it's BYOB. There will be an array of snacks but feel free to bring your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have multiple tables so we could break up into 2 groups as I don't think I could accomodate a lot at 1 table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to, bring $1 to contribute towards our Meetup fees. It's much appreciated, but absolutely not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll can play whatever game everyone agrees on as long as someone owns it. I am not sure of just how many people I can accomodate as I have multiple tables but 8 seems good for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attendee limit at each of these events will be determined by the maximum number of players the game can accommodate, so it will vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any questions call me at 860 633-3424&lt;/p&gt;
