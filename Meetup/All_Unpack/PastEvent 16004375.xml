But when the mysterious Countess Ellen Olenska returns to New York after a disastrous marriage, Archer is deeply moved by her. Torn between duty and passion, Archer struggles to make a decision that will either courageously define his life—or mercilessly destroy it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the plot. Stylistically, this is Wharton's most romantic novel, yet our expectations for her lovers are disappointed at every turn. Wharton's genius lies in offering the pleasure of a romance, then engaging the reader in a stunning exploration of boundaries between the demands of society and personal freedom, illicit passion and moral responsibility. In this novel of bold design, we are the innocents unaware of the more demanding rewards to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Wharton’s touch is the deftest, the surest, of all our American manipulators in the novel.” —&lt;i&gt;The New Republic&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>13</waitlist_count><updated>1296511463000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294722698000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wharton: The Age of Innocence </name><id>16004375</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296428400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/16004375/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
