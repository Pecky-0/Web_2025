<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I can fit 12 comfortably and would like to play some smaller player games so I'll set up some extra tables - I have Forbidden Island - Russ, bring Pandemic!, and what's anyone else got?

&lt;p&gt;Bring snacks to share if you'd like and BYOB if you'd like alcohol&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana</member_name><member_id>5417968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>6</waitlist_count><updated>1366250483000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364134788000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play small group games</name><id>110783942</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365894000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/110783942/</event_url></item>
