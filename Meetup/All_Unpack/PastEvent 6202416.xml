<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 2-day hike on the Appalachian Trail starting north of Cheshire, MA and heading northbound over Mt. Greylock to North Adams, MA for a total of about 12.3 miles. This is the next segment of the AT from May '07. We'll spend the night at a Lean-to on the trail (there's a chance it could be full so plan accordingly). This hike is for experienced hikers who have done 10 mile hikes and steep trail before as well as lightly equiped backpacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 2pm at Pattison Rd. parking area south of N. Adams MA. (see below). Promptly at 2:15pm we will shuttle to Outlook Ave. in Cheshire MA to start the hike. The first day we'll cover 3.6 miles. We'll hike up the flank of Saddle Ball Mtn. for an altitude gain of 1,800ft. and sleep at the Mark Neopel Lean-to. We should be getting to the Lean-to before 5:30pm to set up for the night, eat dinner, and enjoy the evening. The Lean-to sleeps up to 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the second day, we'll continue starting 8am at the latest on to the peak of Mt. Greylock (the tallest mountain in MA) with an altitude gain of 740ft., for an elevation of 3,491ft. We'll then hike down hitting Mt. Fitch and Mt. Williams with a total elevation loss of 2,590ft. Overall we'll cover 8.7 miles this day and end at the parking area for the AT on Pattison Rd. (see below). We should end hiking by about 6pm. After the hike, we'll hit a place to eat in N. Adams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that terrain, conditions, and individual party members may affect the overall timing of the hike and may necessitate backup plans if any member of the party runs into significant issues or if there are weather related issues that spring up. I have been conservitive with the estimated times and as long as all parties are reasonable fit, experienced, and equiped we should come in earlier than I estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;== ADVISED MUST-BRING GEAR/SUPPLIES ==&lt;br /&gt;* Full pack&lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots -Must be comfortable, &amp;amp; broken in &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks&lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing -Cold mornings/nights &amp;amp; possibly hot afternoons, avoid cotton as it stays wet.
