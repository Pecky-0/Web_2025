&lt;p&gt;I'm looking to understand if it's better to meet in town or hold the event somewhere in Waltham, Lexington or Burlington area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to know if members of our group are interested in having a speaker attend to speak for 20 minutes on a topic of interest to the members. I am planning to have food as well but cocktails will be on a cash basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am conducting an informal poll to understand what our members would be interested in and here are the choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. No Speaker - Just Networking &lt;br /&gt;

2. Speaker and Networking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send me your ideas on what you would like the speaker to talk about if you're interested in having a speaker. Also, let me know the venue of choice that could accommodate our group - we're almost a hundred people and growing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon Nugent</member_name><member_id>29805572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350000464000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Healthcare-IT-Professionals</urlname><id>1467042</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston Healthcare IT Professionals</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346870639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RSVP </name><id>80987342</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349989200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Healthcare-IT-Professionals/events/80987342/</event_url></item>
