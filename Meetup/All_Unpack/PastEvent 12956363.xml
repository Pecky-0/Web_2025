<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I wanted to set up a meeting to discuss the best ways of car pooling or flying if cheaper to Virginia for Williamsburg and Atlantic City for Cape May depending on if it's cheaper to fly or drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has already been to Williamsburg and has ideas that would be great. I have not set a date yet for Williamsburg, but Cape May would be in June. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot make the meeting Sunday you can call me and have a discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought we could meet in Derry at Burger King right off the exit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269975908000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269276103000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discussion meeting on Cape May and Wiliiamsburg</name><id>12956363</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269802800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/12956363/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/8/global_13798104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
