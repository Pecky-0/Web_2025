Each of the sites along the way is important in America's Revolutionary era history, some of which include The Boston Common, The State House, Park Street Church, Granary Burying Ground, Old South Meeting House, Site of the Boston Massacre, Faneuil Hall, Paul Revere House, Old North Church, Bunker Hill Monument and the USS Constitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Finagle-A-Bagel just outside Park St. Station on the MBTA Red Line.  Our walk will be about 3-1/2 miles total.  We will finish at North Station on the MBTA Green line which will take us back to Park Street (and further south) on the MBTA Red line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dress accordingly for the weather, wear comfortable shoes, and consider bringing a camera.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer O</member_name><member_id>8579834</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288905533000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287938995000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walking the Freedom Trail</name><id>15211200</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288540800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/15211200/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/4/global_17172772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
