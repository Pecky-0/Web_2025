<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Please join us for an introduction to garden planning with open pollinated plant selections. You'll learn the basics of how to choose plants that will provide the great flavor and nutrition that heirlooms are known for. You will also learn the basic methods for saving seeds for future years planting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed saving has become a political issue that goes beyond just preserving a favored variety. It is a defense against corporate theft of our very sustainance. So come on by and learn a bit about the simple art of saving seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will be held in Ipswich at 26 Topsfield Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested donation of $3 to help cover Meetup Costs...no one will be turned away for lack of funds. Seeds may be available for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
