So, if you can join me, hope you will.  If not, no need to complain about the last minute nature of the posting!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details about the park and directions at www.northwestpark.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a two to three mile walk at a social pace (for you speed demons, that means slow!).  Dogs and kids are welcome.  I will have my very energetic six month old puppy with me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the parking lot at 1:00.  I drive a tan Ford Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
