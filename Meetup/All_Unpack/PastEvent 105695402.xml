&lt;p&gt;AJ (me!) will host and is going to try and get a decent seat at 6:15, lecture starts at 6:30.  We can decide after if folks are interested in getting a drink or some thing to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More info on the event can be found at &lt;a href="http://onhsa.yale.edu/science-news-lecture-series-0"&gt;THIS Link (Click on it in event)&lt;/a&gt;.  (Don't try the Library's Website, they usually just reserve the room.)  Past lectures have been broken down into layman's terms quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's first come first serve FREE Parking near by in Yale's Lot 51 on Temple Street (Lot is between houses 302 and 320).  Otherwise if parking you'd probably need to find a metered spot on Temple or Elm.  ($1.50/hr until 9pm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Event description also promises light Snacks, but no details on them.  (Last time it was Insomnia Cookies and Juice/Coffee/Water)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Event is in the Community Public Room.
