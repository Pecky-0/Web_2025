We have just a little work left to do mulching beds and preparing the beds for Winter. We'll provide the tools, water and a snack. Please bring gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, The Network of Open Space Friends, working with the town, is planning the second town-wide volunteer cleanup in Plymouth from Nov. 6 to Nov. 14.  We'll do our part by picking up trash along Long Pond Road abutting the forest. The Network is made up of “Friends” groups from all over Plymouth. Last Spring the Network’s first town wide clean-up took place. Many Plymouth volunteers graciously stepped up to the plate in an effort to keep our parks and open spaces looking good and the result was a resounding success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Friend's sandwich board at the parking area at Long Pond Road.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289236879000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288817286000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>East Entrance Work Party</name><id>15328576</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289152800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/15328576/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/e/0/global_18814832.jpeg</photo_url></item>
