If it is raining, I will still be there and you are welcome to join.  Afterall, sometimes it rains during a race, why not practice like you play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first meetup I figure a run is the easiest to plan and we'll see how many people decide to join by then!  If this date doesnt work for you, but you would like to be an active member of the group, let me know what days work best for you!  Depending on the group, we can decided how much of a run to go for along the esplanade.  We will meet at the waterfountain/ outdoor gym thing on the boston side of the esplanade.  For those of you who don't know where this, is the best place to park is on Bay state Road probably between # 130 and 175 Then head down Sherborn towards the Charles and over the pedestrian walkway over storrow drive.  The outdoor gym and waterfountain will be right in front of you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186785293000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185287036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Tri Group Meet up!</name><id>6069264</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186612200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/6069264/</event_url></item>
