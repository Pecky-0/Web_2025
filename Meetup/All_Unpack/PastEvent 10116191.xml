They make too many changes &lt;br /&gt;for me to keep track, so it is easier for you to read the changes &lt;br /&gt;on their link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sgra.org/paracon/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sgra.org/p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.sgra.org/paracon/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SGRA has brought some issues to my attention. &lt;br /&gt;My way of handling those issues is to have this memo in all &lt;br /&gt;SGRA Meet Ups in 2009. &lt;br /&gt;SGRA Events ARE NOT TOTALLY FREE. &lt;br /&gt;They have raffle and meal tickets that cost money. &lt;br /&gt;Some events have booklets that cost money. &lt;br /&gt;SGRA and the Vendors sell products that cost money. &lt;br /&gt;Psychics and others give readings that cost money. &lt;br /&gt;You can go on their site of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sgra-media.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sgra-media...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.sgra-media.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details and some things can be &lt;br /&gt;Purchased on line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SGRA asks for a donation for attending some of their events. &lt;br /&gt;(Yea, I know. You can talk to them about the difference between &lt;br /&gt;a donation and charging admission. I am not getting involved.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SGRA has brought to my attention that some of my members &lt;br /&gt;Have gone to SGRA Events. They told SGRA that I said &lt;br /&gt;That my members do not have to pay for anything at the &lt;br /&gt;SGRA Events. I really do not know what they are talking &lt;br /&gt;About because none of my members have come to me &lt;br /&gt;With this issue.  I would not say this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I continue to receive complaints, then I will cease and desist in &lt;br /&gt;Creating Meet Ups for SGRA Events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If necessary, as much as I enjoy going to SGRA Events, it is &lt;br /&gt;Not worth reading about the complains and issues. &lt;br /&gt;I will end my involvement with SGRA as well.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Research Group are POCs for this Event.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244419777000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238883385000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coffee Talk attends Movie Screening at Ho Jos on June 5</name><id>10116191</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244246400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/coffee-397/events/10116191/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/c/3/global_1719779.jpeg</photo_url></item>
