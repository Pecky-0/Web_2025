&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poll this month was a knockout win for "Among Others" by Jo Walton. I closed the poll early since it was ahead by 7 votes. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

From Amazon: &lt;span&gt;Elements of fantasy, science fiction, and coming-of-age novels combine into one superlative literary package that will appeal to a variety of readers across age levels. After engaging in a classic good-magic-versus-bad-magic battle with her mother that fatally wounds her twin sister, 15-year-old Morwenna leaves Wales and attempts to reconnect with her estranged father. She was sent to boarding school in England, and her riveting backstory unfolds gradually as she records her thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a series of journal entries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones and across the street from Orleans restaurant. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Josh&lt;/p&gt;
