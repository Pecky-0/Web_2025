They are selling the tickets for this show under the description Digital Projection, not sure what that means exactly, but they are NOT charging extra for it.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, since we see movies opening weekend, it is a very good idea to buy tickets ahead of time...especially if it is a big name movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a meetup badge. Check out my picture on the meetup site, so you will recognize me. I generally get there about an hour before the show and the group heads in for seats about 30 minutes before hand. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator and if it is downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather after the movie just outside the room where it was shown to talk about the movie a bit and get a head count of those who would like to come out for drinks, munchies and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: October 1, 2010&lt;br /&gt;Studio: Columbia Pictures (Sony)&lt;br /&gt;Director: David Fincher&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Aaron Sorkin&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake, Andrew Garfield, Joe Mazzello, Rashida Jones&lt;br /&gt;Genre: Drama&lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thesocialnetwork-movie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thesocialn...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. From director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin comes &amp;quot;The Social Network,&amp;quot; a film that proves you don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies. The film is produced by Scott Rudin, Dana Brunetti, Michael De Luca, and Ce√°n Chaffin and based on the book &amp;quot;The Accidental Billionaires&amp;quot; by Ben Mezrich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Meetup Badge.
