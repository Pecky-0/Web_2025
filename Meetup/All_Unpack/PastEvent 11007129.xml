I am looking forward to the tour and you all!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come enjoy the ambience of Hammond Castle Museum under candlelight as we present nine evenings of candlelit tours.  John Hays Hammond, Jr. enjoyed his little abbey by the sea in candlelight and we use that lighting normally for our wedding and corporate clients so why not show it to you.  Tours will be offered at 5:30, 6:30, and 7:15  PM during Thursday nights in July and August.  We will be open those Thursdays from 10 AM till 8 PM with the last tickets sold at 7:15 PM.  Prepare yourself for a most unusual experience as we journey back to the John Hays Hammond days and lifestyle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards maybe we can get a bite to eat or go for a drink?!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in the parking area!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250377570000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249128121000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's go check out Hammond Castle by candlelit!!!</name><id>11007129</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250204400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/11007129/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/global_7284256.jpeg</photo_url></item>
