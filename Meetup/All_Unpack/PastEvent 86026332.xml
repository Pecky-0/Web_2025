 &lt;br /&gt;

Well that sucked, I did not see The Pack loosing to Indi one little bit at all, we now stand at 2 â€“ 3 and need to win next Sunday night against Houston big time, the game will be on both floors this week but if you prefer the 2nd floor please get here early as it dose fill up quickly. I would like to say a big THANK YOU to the group so far as the turn out has been unbelievable, I hope to see you this Sunday at 8.20pm for Green Bay @ Houston, as usual if any of you have any suggestions or comments please let me know. I would also like to apologize if some of you had to wait for food yesterday as we did not realize so many people would show up for the games on the 1st floor, thank you for your understanding. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Go Pack, &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Ray Butler.&lt;/p&gt;
