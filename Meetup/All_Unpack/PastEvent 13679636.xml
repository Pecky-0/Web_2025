We were absolutely blown away at how many people joined together on the same day in the name of fun and photography. This year, we want each of you to invite your friends, family, and even strangers to take part and help us make it the biggest and best one yet! (Just be wary of those strangers with shifty eyes… and candy. They’re probably up to no good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to sign up for the Worcester Walk?
