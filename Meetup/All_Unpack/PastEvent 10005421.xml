It ascends into a beautiful red pine forest. The trail passes a good outlook to Mt. Chocorua and the number of pines decrease as the trail ascends into scrub with nice views increasing in frequency. The majority of the route is in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the parking area on Passaconaway Rd., the Moat Mountain Trail leads past a gate on a logging road. It then turns sharp right off the road and climbs over a low ridge. It crosses a small brook then climbs over another small ridge. It crosses Dry Brook on a bridge and runs generally east at easy grades. It turns on to a wide, well-constructed relocation with an easy grade. Above this section, the trail becomes steep with rough footing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;b&gt;starting at &lt;u&gt;Moat Mtn Trailhead (northeast)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; hike 2.50 mi/1 hr 19 min/+2098 ft on the Moat Mtn Trail &lt;b&gt;to South Moat Mtn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total distance is 6 miles round trip and about 1800 feet of elevation. The pace will be steady but matched to the abilities of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book time is about 5 hours round trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; The south terminus of the trail is located on Dugway Rd. At the lights in Conway village, turn north (directly opposite NH 153) onto Washington St., which becomes West Side Rd. Go left at a fork, then at 0.9 mi. turn left on Passaconaway Rd., which becomes Dugway Rd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moat Mountain Trail (sign) leaves Dugway Rd. at a new trailhead parking area on the right, 4.1 mi. from Conway. Dugway Rd. continues and joins the Kancamagus Highway near Blackberry Crossing Campground (but the west part of Dugway Rd. is closed to vehicles from November to May).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Diane's cell phone 603-477-5116   cell service is unreliable in the mountains</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240319583000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237677520000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Moats via Moat Mtn Trailhead NE</name><id>10005421</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240146000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/10005421/</event_url></item>
