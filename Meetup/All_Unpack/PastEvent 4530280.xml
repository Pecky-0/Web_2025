As the organizer, I pay this fee and am supposed to collect donations from the group. I'm asking for a $2 donation from those who attend the meetups; this is voluntary, so if you can't pay it, don't worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closet T stop to the Trident is Hynes/Mass Ave on the Green Line. All lines except the E (outbound) go to this stop; all inbound lines pass it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking can be difficult but not impossible to find on Newbury Street. There are also some garages close by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to bring business cards and enough money to order food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.tridentbookscafe.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tridentbookscafe.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tridentboo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Graphic Designers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>graphicdesign-39</urlname><id>71144</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Graphic Design Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1112834317000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Graphic Design May Meetup</name><id>4530280</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1115249400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/graphicdesign-39/events/4530280/</event_url></item>
