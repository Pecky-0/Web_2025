Filmmaker Michael P. Nash's stark documentary outlines a frightening vision of a future in which depleted resources and shrinking coastlines force millions of people to become "climate refugees." But where will they go? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you! These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It's also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that's truly helping the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All donations will be given to support the work of the American Refugee Committee &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303603754000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302620965000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup for April - Climate Refugees</name><id>17276570</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303599600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/17276570/</event_url></item>
