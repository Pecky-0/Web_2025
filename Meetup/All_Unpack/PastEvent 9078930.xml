This is why it's prices are so reasonable. Further, since I'm a member at The Sports Club, we'll get a discount. Blue is in the same building as the AMC movie theatre off of Boston Common and the Sports Club LA. Enter via the Sports Club Entrance on 4 Avery St. and take the elevator to the 4th Floor. Then turn left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blu sits in a fantastic location, just between the Boston Common and Washington St. So it has a cool view overlooking the Paramount Theatre, which I believe is the oldest in the nation. After brunch you can go for a walk in the Common, shop along Washington St/Downtown Crossing, or catch a matinee movie or play. This would make for a perfect Sunday! If all goes well, I could be up for a walk or for seeing a movie  Also, there is this awesome old hat shop just around the corner on Tremont. Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, hope to see you all at Blu this week. If not, whatever you're up to, I hope you are doing well and taking care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Mike/Meet up</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231714367000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225656566000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch Anyone?
