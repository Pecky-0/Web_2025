Join us to build world peace and celebrate independence for all nations with an anti-imperialist fourth of July picnic hosted by the Socialist Party of Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comrades from across Massachusetts and New England will converge on the Charles River Reservation in Boston on Friday, 4 July, 12-4 pm, to celebrate the anti-imperialist legacy of the Fourth of July and enjoy food and fun in good company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring some food to share, and we'll provide the charcoal, burgers (veggie and otherwise), frisbees, and Wobbly song books. No stars and stripes, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Charles River Reservation is located off Soldiers Field Road past Elliot Bridge (coming from Boston), near Harvard Stadium. Look for a parking lot, picnic area, and kayak rental kiosk. Call 248/303-3785 if you have trouble finding us.
