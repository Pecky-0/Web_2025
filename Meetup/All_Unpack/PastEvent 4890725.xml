If you plan on coming i would buy your tickets in advance on www.fandango.com The movie time is 6:15. So we could get together for an early meet up for something to eat or catch a bite to eat after. I think this is the first weekend out. If you don't want to get together before to eat....meet me inside the movie theater right underneath the sign that says THEATERS 3-19..it's right in the main area you can't miss the sign it's all lit up. The showing time is 6:15, that means get to the meeting spot by 5:30 unless you want to go out for something to eat...email me back...I think it will be nice to get together before the show...rsdragon@optonline.net....AIM  rsthelastdragon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540168000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1143942634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MEDFORD/BOSTON MOVIE GOERS FAN MEETUP GROUP Meetup</name><id>4890725</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1146951000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/4890725/</event_url></item>
