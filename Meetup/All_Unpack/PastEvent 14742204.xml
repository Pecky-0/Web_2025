Join us for a potluck picnic to welcome new members and say goodbye to summer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have many new members who have joined this year, but not all have had a chance to come out to an event. We hope many of you new members will come out to meet &amp;amp; greet. Of course this event is open to all members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This event is free&lt;/b&gt; - we only ask that you bring a potluck dish, drink or snack. Show off your cooking skills and bring a dish to share. If you can't cook or don't have time, then please buy something to bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tme: 1pm - 5pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have rented a &lt;b&gt;picnic tables 8, 9 &amp;amp; 10.&lt;/b&gt; These tables and grills are near the covered picnic area &amp;amp; water fountain. We also have one grill available. Please bring a lawn chair or picnic blanket. We will set up a badminton net, VB net and there are tennis courts at the park as well. The weather looks good for saturday. We hope to see you there. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rides&lt;/b&gt; - if you need a ride or can provide a ride, please indicate the town and/or T stop you are coming from.
