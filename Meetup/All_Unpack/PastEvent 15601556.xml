Monson is an old town that has been turned into several great, hiking trails. There are also some big fields for the dogs to run around and play in. Once away from the road the dogs can be off leash.  Holly who lives in the area will help lead the hike so I don't manage to get us to lost.  With a bunch of loose dogs would a trail of bread crumbs work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to the hiking trails at Monson Village... &lt;a href="http://Monson Village Hiking Trails" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://forestsociety.org/ourproperties/guide/108/108_map.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://forestsociety....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is one description of the site....&lt;a href="http://Monson Village" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.svlt.org/Trails/TractMap.asp?TownName=Milford&amp;amp;TractName=Monson%20Village" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.svlt.org/T...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is another link about Monson Village......&lt;a href="http://Monson Village 3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM65Y_Monson_New_Hampshire" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.waymarking...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is hunting season you and your dog may want to wear orange or yellow of some sort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The trail head where there is parking along Federal Hill Road is at the Milford/Hollis town line.  Because there is not an exact address at the town line, Butternut Farm, 483 Federal Hill Rd in Milford is being used as a reference for directions but the town line is actually 0.2 miles south of the farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coming from Milford&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from where Federal Hill Rd starts off of Emerson Road the town line is 2.5 miles away.  At 2.3 miles you will pass Butternut Farm, 483 Federal Hill Rd. and the town line will be 0.2 miles ahead with parking on the left . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coming from Hollis&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; where Federal Hill Rd starts off of Silver Lake Road (Rt 122) the town line is 3.6 miles ahead with parking on the right.  From where Federal Hill Rd intersects with Hayden Rd in Hollis the town line is 1.0 miles ahead.  Coming from Hollis if you miss the town line trail head you will come to 483 Federal Hill Rd in Milford in another 0.2 miles and will need to turn around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the White Suzuki Grand Vitara with the DOGPARK license plate</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291500075000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291163950000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trail Walking in Monson Village - Milford/Hollis Townline</name><id>15601556</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291485600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/15601556/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/e/7/global_19910023.jpeg</photo_url></item>
