All attendee's can suggest topics for discussion, and we will go from there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm ready for some ideas, does anyone want to step up and offer some topics?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you a background on myself...  I am the Director of IT Staffing with Smart Staffing Services Inc.  My goal is to network and meet with as many technology professionals as possible in the Boston area.  My role will be to provide a meeting location, food, beverages, and any other requests.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be the members that essentially run the meeting topics.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting everyone!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Carey</member_name><member_id>3420865</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542446000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New Technologists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston_New_Technology</urlname><id>771580</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston New Technology Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193171372000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Software Development Technology</name><id>6604259</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197496800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston_New_Technology/events/6604259/</event_url></item>
