The topic for this session will be focused on: What is a spiritual community; what are its benefits and how to find one.&lt;br /&gt; Researches done in the field exploring the spirit-mind-body connection have shown that when people are part of a spiritual community, their resiliency is increased. Practicing meditation is another factor in keeping a sense of peace even in challenging moments. This meet up will be an opportunity to meditate as well as learning and being with people desiring to grow in consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward seeing you and contact me if any questions,&lt;br /&gt;Rev.
