Ave. from Boston on a Sunday afternoon traveling through Cambridge, Arlington and Lexington.  Staying on Mass. Ave. into Lexington Center, we could then bear right at the Lexington Minuteman Statue following Rt. 225 west through Lexington, Bedford, Concord, Carlisle and on into Westford, home of Kimball Farms Ice Cream.   An option for a shorter trip along the same route would be a trip to Bedford Farms Ice Cream in Bedford or the Kimball Farm (smaller) Ice Cream stand in Carlisle. The group can decide once we are all convened in Arlington. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston area members to meetup at Starbucks at 165 Newbury and leave there by 10:30 AM and travel Jam'n Java 594 Mass. Ave., Arlington for those who prefer to join us there. Leave Jam'n Java by 11:15 AM. Joe will lead us from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return along the same route or looping over onto Rt. 2A east in Concord.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>JoeXT225</member_name><member_id>6874870</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286801129000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Scooterists, scooter, scoot</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonScoots</urlname><id>1509243</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>Boston Scoots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284631956000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kimball Farm Ice Cream in Westford, MA</name><id>14789692</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286721000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonScoots/events/14789692/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/7/global_10283543.jpeg</photo_url></item>
