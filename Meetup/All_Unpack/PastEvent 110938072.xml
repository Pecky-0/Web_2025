&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;Creating Vibrant Health with Ayurveda - Part I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Would you like to know how to create physical and psychological balance through the foods you eat and when you eat them? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Ever since I enjoyed an Ayurvedic Retreat at Kripalu (almost 2 years ago) I have adopted many of the practices of Ayurveda for my personal dosha! It will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me that my Dosha is the HOT one called Pitta. I use the cooling oil of the coconut on my feet in the AM. I avoid hot sun at mid-day, wear cooling colors and manage stress with daily meditation. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

In this class you will discover YOUR dosha and the best foods, times of day to eat, sleep and work. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Ayurveda is the Art and Science of Medicine from ancient India. It is based on the elements and rhythms of nature as they exist in your individual body. For over 5000 years, people of all cultures including ours, have adopted this system in their daily lives to maintain vibrant health. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
