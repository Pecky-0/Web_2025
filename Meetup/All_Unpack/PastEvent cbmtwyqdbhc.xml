Thanks to everyone who ran or supported and sorry to those who weren't able to make it... the good news is we'll be entering more TMIRCE teams in 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;012 races including the upcoming Massachusetts REACH The Beach Relay on May 18-19. Yes, our very own Hudson Doyle is captaining a team of Informal Runners and we want to give them the best support ever! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Join us at TMIRCE on Saturday February 25th as we run with team "Hudson told us It was a 5K" and make sure they get in shape to do us proud... we'll be running the usual 3,4,5 and 7 mile loops so there's something for everyone! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Our friends from REACH The Beach Relay will be there plus some of their awesome sponsors to give out goodies, training tips and general good cheer... keep checking back for more details! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Our volunteering with RTB each year provides us with funds to continue making running club free and there'll be a chance to talk about helping out again in 2012 too if you would like. Plus it's not too late to sign up some more TMIRCE running teams for RTB:MA of course! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

It's the usual time (10.30am), and usual place (City Sports, Packard's Corner) but with an extraordinarily large group of us... please tell all your friends and tell them to tell their friends... &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Breakfast Details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; : Between 11:15 and 11:30 (depending on how long we run) we will meet at CITY SPORTS @ BU* for breakfast. If you would like to bring a breakfast item to share (eggs, bagels, fruits, muffins, juice, bacon, potatoes, etc.) please feel free to do so. You are not obligated to bring anything, though, so please join us for breakfast after the run!&lt;/p&gt;
