Explore the story behind the survival and destruction of some of Boston's most beloved historic landmarks. Join us as we learn about the loss of the John Hancock House, the dramatic rescue of Old South Meeting House (the earliest historic preservation effort in the United States), and the issues surrounding the fate of the Filene's building (and that big hole in the ground next to Downtown Crossing). We will discuss the pivotal part Boston played in the development of the Historic Preservation movement and the role of preservation in a vibrant modern city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour is 90 minutes long and ends near Downtown Crossing.  The tour will start promptly at 2pm, so please show up by 1:45 to pay and get organized into a group.  Tour cost is $15 cash (or $5 if you are a card-carrying Boston By Foot member - &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;click here for membership details&lt;/a&gt;).  Look for me, amy!, wearing a Boston By Foot button with my name on it and a Meetup logo button.  I'll make sure all the nerds go with the same group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for people with Boston By Foot badges - mine says 'Amy!'</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251847888000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251126287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Preserving Boston's History walking tour</name><id>11185733</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251654300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11185733/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/b/global_2222155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
