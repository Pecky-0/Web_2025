Gone to a dance and want to do more than they teach in the beginner lesson? Here's your chance to learn! Swing is hot again, and as fun as ever. Learn triple rhythm and basic six-count moves, the foundation for all swing styles, including Lindy, Jitterbug, and Jive. Whether you like Big Band or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, George Strait or Dire Straits, oldies or new generation, you can swing to them all. Come with a partner, or come alone. Guaranteed to swing away the winter blahs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taught by one of our own members (not some young whippersnapper), this class will get you ready to dance the night away. Classes are run through Arlington Community Education. You need to register with them by going to their website at www.arlingtoncommunityed.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classes are held on Thursday evenings, beginning January 10, for 5 weeks. Time is 6:30-7:30 pm, and the cost is just $70. The next session will be on Wednesday evenings 7:30-8:30 pm, and will be an 8-week session starting March 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie K.</member_name><member_id>3968681</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron R.</member_name><member_id>4515948</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357874189000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357098751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn to Swing Dance with Dance Lessons</name><id>97413362</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357860600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/97413362/</event_url></item>
