Michelle has scouted transportation to our next destination - Buenos Aires, Argentina. From Rio, we'll travel by train through the towns of Santos and Curitiba along the southeastern coast of Brazil. From Curitiba, we'll travel by jeep to Iguassu Falls, on the border of Paraguay. From Iguassu Falls, we'll journey by riverboat down the Parana River into Agentina, finally arriving in Buenos Aires, with a lovely view of Colonia, Uruguay from across the Rio de la Plata (River Plate). Won't you join us for what I'm certain will prove to be a sublime culinary journey into South American cuisine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, Michelle has agreed to a special dance performance should at least 20 EDEMG members attend dinner. Michelle has been taking ballroom dance lessons for several months now and has decided to pay tribute to the culture of Argentina by performing &amp;quot;Tango Claro&amp;quot;! This is a performance not to be missed! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tango - the most famous of Argentinean rhytms, like Spanish &amp;quot;flamengo&amp;quot;, it is played, sung and danced. Famous tango singers include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos Gard√©l (the most famous of all times was actually French by birth, but adopted in Argentina as a national symbol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julio Sosa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tita Merello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alberto Castillo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susana Rinaldi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the website for additional details.
