<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a great opportunity to sample some local wines and do some holiday shopping. Whether you are a connoisseur or newbie, join us for a tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diamond Hill Vineyards is a small winery in Cumberland, RI. They have been growing fine wine grapes since 1976. They produce Estate Pinot Noir, Pinot Noir Blanc, River Valley White, Blackstone Blush, Cranberry Apple, Spiced Apple, Peach and Blueberry wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can stop by Phantom Farms (www.phantomfarms.com) after the tasting. Phantom Farms has a variety of pastries, including a pumpkin mousse roll (my favorite) that was featured on the Food Network in September ’08.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is enough interest, I plan to make this into a series of visits to local wineries and breweries in Southern New England. Come explore what’s in your backyard.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1228850332000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227977882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wine Tasting at Diamond Hill Vineyards and Dessert</name><id>9246620</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228676400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/9246620/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
