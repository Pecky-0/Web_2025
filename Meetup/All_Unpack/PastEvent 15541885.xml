<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm having a pre-holiday party warm up to get ready for the following weekend's pot luck.  Bring food to share and/or something to drink.  Please post with your RSVP what you will be bringing so that we won't have too much of the same thing.  There will be someone from another group there with his keyboard.  I promised that if he brought his keyboard, we would sing!  Feel free to bring your favorite music too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meetup is at a private location, the details of the location will be e-mailed out before the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a joint event with the Eastern Mass Italian Culture and Language Group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EMAIL NOELLE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND. SHE WILL SEND YOU LOCATION DETAILS.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check your e-mail for the address.
