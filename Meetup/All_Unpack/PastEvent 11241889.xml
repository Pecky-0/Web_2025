Parking is on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Imaginary Invalid (French: Le Malade imaginaire) is a three-act &lt;b&gt;comedy&lt;/b&gt; by the French playwright Molière. It was first performed in 1673 and was the last work he wrote. Molière collapsed during his fourth performance as the hypochondriac on 17 February and died soon after. The original play included dance sequences and musical interludes that Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play is about a miser, Argan, who imagines himself sick when he is not. He dutifully sticks to any instructions given to him by his doctor. His doctors milk his hypochondria for all it is worth, which leads eventually to their demise. Argan wants his daughter Angelique to marry a doctor so he can get free medical care, even though she is already in love with Cleante. Together with Argan's maid Toinette, his brother Beralde attempts to cure Argan of his fixation on doctors. Together, they convince him to play dead, in order to find out who is really loyal to him. As it turns out, Argan's second wife is only after his money, whereas his daughter really loves him. After the revival of the supposedly-dead Argan, Angelique is free to marry whomever she chooses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performances are free with a suggested donation of: $20 Adult, $10 Student, $5 Children (12 and under)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These donations are suggested and completely voluntary.  Whatever you are able to contribute is entirely your choice and very much appreciated.  This being said, it is important to share with our audience the importance of these donations.  We strive to keep our performances free of charge however the reality is that our funding from the private, corporate and public sectors has been reduced this year.  In many cases support has been cut completely and in others it has been reduced by as much as 30%.  Since we do not require tickets to attend our performances we rely 100% on contributed income.   Therefore, if you do have the capacity to support us we ask that you do so!  With your support we will be able to continue the high quality professional performances each summer that you have come to expect and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.elmshakespeare.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.elmshakespeare.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the purple and yellow balloons!
