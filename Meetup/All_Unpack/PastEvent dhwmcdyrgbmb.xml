 This CT Health Foodies event is part of an ongoing series of monthly potluck dinners and talks held on the second Tuesday of the month at ArtSpace in downtown Hartford. We are a diverse group, and we respect everyone’s food choices. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Every other month, we bring in speakers. &lt;br /&gt;

 For our May 14 potluck, Chef Bill Klar will be doing a cooking demo, and he will be making refreshing, easy-to-make pressed salad, curried lentils with coconut milk, or “nishime,” lightly steamed chunky vegetables. Klar is a graduate of the French Culinary Institute in New York and the Kushi Institute, the world’s foremost center for macrobiotic studies, in Massachusetts. He has appeared on WTNH TV 8’s Connecticut Style.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Enter through the back entrance by the murals.  Walk down the long corridor.
