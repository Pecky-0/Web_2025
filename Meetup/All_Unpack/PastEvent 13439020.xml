I went to the last event they presented and can say that the lecture covers much of the same material that the Paranormal 101 class I gave in February did.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Following the lecture, one of the members of Silent Voices (their dowsing expert) will give us a 15-minute class on dowsing and how it fits into a paranormal investigation. I'll have rods available for all of us to practice on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is &lt;b&gt;no limit&lt;/b&gt; to the number of people who want to register for dinner, the lecture, and the dowsing class. However, the event has &lt;b&gt;a maximum of 12 people&lt;/b&gt; for the actual investigation. This is because we'll be investigating the second floor of the original inn building, and space is limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo, &lt;b&gt;REGISTER SOON IF YOU WANT TO BE PART OF THE INVESTIGATION.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The investigation is led by Silent Voices. Between their equipment and mine, everyone should be able to work with some of the most common pieces of equipment used in investigations. Of course, if you have your own, please bring what you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought we can use the dinner to socialize and meet each other, so I hope you can make it. &lt;br /&gt;Dinner, good company, and talking about ghosts--what could be better? &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/laughing.gif' border='0' alt='laughing' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fee free to email me with any questions you have about this event, and I'll try to answer them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phone Number for Reservations: 978-874-2000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: www.wachusettvillageinn.com/map-directions/cfm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy </member_name><member_id>7992934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275796248000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>footsteps-paranormal-meetup</urlname><id>1305459</id><group_lat>42.5699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0</group_lon><name>Footsteps Paranormal Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273514376000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Ghostly Get-Together and Investigation at Wachusett Village Inn</name><id>13439020</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275692400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/footsteps-paranormal-meetup/events/13439020/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/7/6/global_14957750.jpeg</photo_url></item>
