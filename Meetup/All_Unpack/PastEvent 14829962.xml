She has an incredible voice that has been described like Jewel's with a &amp;quot;pinch of country twang.&amp;quot;  The title song of her CD was picked up by In-Play Films in Seattle for their feature motion picture, &amp;quot;Good For You&amp;quot; set for release later this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the function room located in the back of the store.  Come early to browse the gift shop - they have lots of great stuff.  There is also a cafe so grab a beverage and bring it to the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashley will play from 6:30 to 8:30 pm, so please arrive to take your seat by 6:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a free concert.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacki</member_name><member_id>6777705</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285525755000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284985044000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Early Evening Music at Tatnuck with Ashley Jordan</name><id>14829962</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285452900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/14829962/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/3/global_18110499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
