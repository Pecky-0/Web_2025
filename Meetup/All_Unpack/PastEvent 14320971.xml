So let's celebrate on Thursday's opening night, which won't be as crowded as on the weekend. The Feast will feature Italian food stands with offerings such as arancini, calamari, pizza, etc., sourvenir vendors, food samples, marching bands, games, religious symbols and a diverse mix of people. We'll gather in the piano lounge of Ristorante Fiore (250 Hanover St.) for a drink between 6:00-7:00. The restaurant is located on the left side of Hanover St. as you come from the Greenway, about 2 blocks down. At 7:00, we'll slowly walk down Hanover and cross the street to enter the Feast at the corner of Fleet Street. If you come after 7:00, you should be able to catch up with us. At about 8:30-9:00, we'll get together in the Feast's Beer Garden for beer and wine. The Feast will go on regardless of any bad weather, but it's up to you if you want to attend if it's rainy. We could always continue at Fiore in inclement weather. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further event guidelines.
