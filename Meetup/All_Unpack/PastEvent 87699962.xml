For this loosely-structured workshop ArtStudio 360 will be set up with various "stations" for things like watercolor sprays, acrylic painting, rubber-stamping, paper collage, and crayon drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008080"&gt;Five sheets of 9"x12" mixed media paper will be provided to each participant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; you're encouraged to bring additional paper such as cardstock or watercolor paper if you'd like to to make more. Participants will be free to move from one station to another, adding layers until their background feels complete. Your leader Betsi will be available for help and ideas if you start to feel stuck. (And more often than not in these types of workshops your fellow participants are quite generous with ideas and suggestions as well!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat guns for drying and paper cutters for trimming backgrounds to ATC size are available on site, but again feel free to bring your own if you prefer. Everyone should be able to go home with at least &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008080"&gt;FIFTY new ATC backgrounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, ready for your next layers of art and embellishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIME:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 pm to 6 pm. Come whenever you like during that timeframe, but you’re encouraged to arrive as early as you can to make LOTS of backgrounds! Please note, the 6 pm end time is FIRM, I have a housewarming party to go to that evening and cannot hold the studio open later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;All supplies are provided for this workshop, but you are welcome to bring some extra supplies (such as a favorite shade of paint or background stamp) to use on your own or share. Keep in mind that ArtStudio 360 is located on the second floor and there is no elevator, so limit yourself to what you can bring up a flight of stairs easily. Additionally, because of the style of this workshop, personal table space will be limited since we'll be moving from station to station.&lt;/span&gt; Bring your own beverage. Feel free to bring a snack to share—but that’s entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt; $25 cash, regardless of how long you stay. This fee helps keep ArtStudio 360 open, so we can't accept IOUs or partial payments; please plan to pay when you arrive. We're happy to direct you to a nearby ATM if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.) and some supplies including acrylic paints, collage materials, embellishments, paper and more. Access to a microwave, toaster oven, refrigerator, kitchen sink and restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone (18+ only, please). Just RSVP through the NE ATC+ Meetup Group. Membership in the Meetup group is free; joining simply allows you to reserve a space in events at ArtStudio 360.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt; These smaller sessions often fill quickly. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly so that your space becomes available to someone else. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; In the unlikely event that we need to cancel due to bad weather or other reasons---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="color : #800080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW POLICY REGARDING RSVPs:&lt;/strong&gt; Your RSVP is a reservation, and we're trusting that you'll honor it. If you can't make it, please change your RSVP from "yes" to "no" before the event start time. Everybody forgets once in awhile, but repeated no-shows--people who RSVP "yes" but then don't show up--may be asked to pay in advance for future events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsi</member_name><member_id>5074581</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352741303000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350667020000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Background Bonanza</name><id>87699962</id><duration>18000000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352570400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/87699962/</event_url></item>
