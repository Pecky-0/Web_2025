Even though most communication is affected by personality more than gender, gender differences play a major role. Herb will present information from his life and work and also based on a very revealing book &amp;quot;We Have to Talk&amp;quot; by Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey, a Cambridge couple. We will also have a gender dialogue in the group after the information is presented.
