Child Rights and You America is an independent, non-religious, non-political, 501(c)(3) registered non-profit organization in the United States. It works to restore basic rights to underprivileged children, especially from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRY Walk for Child Rights is a platform for individuals to partner the child rights movement that enables lasting change in the lives of children. By simply walking / running in this event each individual in his or her own way will be restoring to children their basic rights to - learn, live, play, express and be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
