Here is a description of the event from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It's important to know what your various purposes in life are, what qualities you are developing in life, and what is really important to you. We all need a guiding focus and light. We'll do exercises to clarify what your purpose is, what qualities are the real &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, and how to be your authentic self. Vegetarian potluck option 6:30-7:30pm, workshop 7:30-9pm. Socialize afterwards til as late as 11pm and of course ask Herb anything you want about this topic or others.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the party is $10.00 - $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming.   The $15.00 includes a party space, dinner type refreshments and Herb’s expertise.  We are also encouraged to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it.  Great food, company and meaning - an awesome way to spend a Friday night!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274792298000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271396360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Purpose To Life Potluck Party</name><id>13198341</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274481000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/13198341/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/e/0/global_3173088.jpeg</photo_url></item>
