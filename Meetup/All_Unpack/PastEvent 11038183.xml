<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>At 9:45 pm, all members should meet at the big glass sculpture, seen here &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.flickr.com...&lt;/a&gt;. . It is most easily found by coming in at the Hotel entrance or heading towards the waterfall. From there, we will most likely bounce around the casino then eventually hit Ultra 88. If you are not at the sculpture by 9:45 then give me a call or text me so we can find you. Timing is important for this night as Ultra 88 fills up fast and after 10 becomes a huge pain to get in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, Ultra 88 has a dress code which is sometimes enforced and there is a $20 cover charge. Button down shirts are encouraged strongly for guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mohegan Sun is a fun spot with tons of people to meet. Let's do it up and have a great time! : ) If any one has any questions email me or call me. You can bring up to three guests per person. Every time we go there it's been a blast and it's my favorite place to go! I don't gamble hardly at all so probably won't do much of that. Looking forward to what I know is going to be a great saturday night!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Glass Sculpture at 09:45p.m. call or text me otherwise 860-919-9782.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249955317000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249436319000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Night Social at Mohegan Sun Casino!</name><id>11038183</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249782300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/11038183/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/4/global_10038884.jpeg</photo_url></item>
