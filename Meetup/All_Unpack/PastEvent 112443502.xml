Bodhipaksa states studies have shown that self-compassion leads to greater emotional resilience and happiness. When we're compassionate toward ourselves not only are we happier, but we're also better placed to help other people. And yet many of us find it hard to be compassionate toward ourselves. We tend to be self-critical, and have difficultly distinguishing self-compassion from self-pity and self-indulgence. On this day of practice and reflection, Bodhipaksa will guide us through practical exercises in developing this important quality of regarding ourselves with compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested donation for the day is $25-$60 which includes a healthy vegetarian lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
