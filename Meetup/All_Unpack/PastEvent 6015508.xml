The group's first road trip is to the Mendon Drive-In and here's to having some fun!!! Should prove to be a nostalgic re-visit for some and a first -time experience for others.  We'll meet at as yet to be determined parking lots near the T.    Alewife and Braintree are the first suggestions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the first event with no Maybe RSVP's. Since the drive-in charges $20 a carload, both drivers and passengers will be depending on each other to be there. The total number of people that can go will be dependent on the number of people who will be driving.  Cars should probably sit 4 people  and passengers will  of course have to chip in for gas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll plan to get there well before sunset and do some tailgating. There's a pretty good consession stand there ( word is that locals go just for the food sometimes)and you can bring in food and non-alcoholic drinks. Bring Frisbees and other such stuff for a little relaxation before showtime. There's  a Drive-In meetup group and we'll be meeting people from that group as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP, write in the comments if you can volunteer to drive or if you are going to be a passenger. SUV drivers beware- you will get stuck in the last 3 rows!!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, we won't know the movie that is showing until the Monday before. Since we are all in this  one together, for better or worse.... dropping out at the last minute would not be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll keep updating this posting with more info and ideas as we get nearer to the night. I've never attended a car-pooling meetup, so any and all suggestions will be appreciated.   Since this is our first road-trip, we will in all likely-hood keep it as simple as possible. Members have suggested going to a local zoo and a local car-hop burger stand beforehand, but maybe we can do that next time(year).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the link to the Mendon Drive-In &lt;a href="http://www.mendondrivein.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mendondriv...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you decide to join us in what should be a fun evening,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188428239000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184282126000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Drive-In Meetup August 25th!!!!</name><id>6015508</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188078300000</time><rsvp_limit>27</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6015508/</event_url></item>
