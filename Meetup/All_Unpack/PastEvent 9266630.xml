<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Alexander Fairley will be presenting &lt;a href="http://www.nongnu.org/fab/" target="_blank"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt;, a simple pythonic remote deployment tool. It is designed to upload files to, and run shell commands on, a number of servers in parallel or serially. These commands are grouped in tasks (regular python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit like a dumbed down &lt;a href="http://www.capify.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Capistrano&lt;/a&gt;, except it's in Python, doesn't expect you to be deploying Rails applications, and the 'put' command works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Capistrano, Fabric wants to stay small, light, easy to change and not bound to any specific framework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexander says, &amp;quot;I've been using fabric to deploy a rather large and wizened codebase to a datacenter in Beijing, as well as ease a great many configuration issues. I'll present my experience with Fabric 0.0.9, as well as what I think the strengths and weaknesses of it are as compared to ParallelSSH.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235001755000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228248316000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Python January Meetup</name><id>9266630</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232582400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/9266630/</event_url></item>
