Although they famously rose out of New Brunswick, New Jersey’s basement culture they’ve always been far too cerebral to be considered a traditional hardcore band. Over their eleven-year career they’ve toured with everyone from the Cure to Cursive, but have retained an inherent aggressiveness that can only come from being weaned on similarly independent nineties acts like Ink And Dagger and Lifetime. All of these references to other bands only serve as guidelines-and with Common Existence (the band's latest album), Thursday have finally reconciled all of their seemingly disparate literary and musical influences into a collection of songs that span the spectrum of human emotions from frustration to hope and, above all, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this band live once or twice, and I love them. They have been around for a few years and have a few albums, some of which sound very different from one another, thereby appealing to fans of many different genres of music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/thursday" target="_blank"&gt;Myspace video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thursday.net" target="_blank"&gt;Band website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3IagEQI75U" target="_blank"&gt;Video for At This Velocity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelley</member_name><member_id>9585647</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261442006000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260805334000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday, Dillinger Escape Plan, Fake Problems, and Endless Hallway</name><id>12081563</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261269000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/12081563/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/global_6726124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
