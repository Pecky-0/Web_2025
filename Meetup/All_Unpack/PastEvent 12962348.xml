Many of us would have been very disappointed if we had missed-out on these early Michael Haneke films at The Goethe-Institut Boston introduced by Professor Roy Grundmann of Boston University.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I am not 100% sure how to co-ordinate this one and so any and all suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  I spoke with someone from the Goethe-Institut today and tickets are only available on a first-come first-served basis. Since the tickets are free and their screening room is somewhat small, she suggested arriving at the Institut at 1:30, a half-hour before the first film. So we can find each other, I'll be holding a meetup-sign outside at this time and again during the 4PM reception. As this will be a 6+ hour event, members can decide for themselves if they would like to go to a restaurant afterward. There are plenty of options available in the neighborhood.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 pm &lt;b&gt;FRAULEIN&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Introduction by Roy Grundmann, Boston University  &lt;br /&gt;Haneke made Fraulein, for German Television in 1984. It is the story of Johanna K., her children, Brigitte and Michael, and her French boyfriend André. It’s also the story of 1950s small town Germany, told in black and white, without sugar-coating or self pity, but with sarcasm and humor. Johanna’s husband Hans has been declared dead after the War and the former French prisoner of War and boxer André moves in, becoming a substitute father to the children and Johanna’s lover, attracting the suspicions of the small town. When Hans unexpectedly returns from the prison camps, André moves back to France. After Hans dies, Johanna looks for André in the Bretagne and finds him a happily married husband and father. Fraulein features two dead bodies and a happy ending of sorts.  &lt;br /&gt;Austria / Germany 1984/85  &lt;br /&gt;DVD  &lt;br /&gt;b&amp;amp;w, 113 min.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4pm Book Presentation and Reception &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Companion to Michael Haneke&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Professor Roy Grundmann, Film Studies Program Director, Boston University, will present A Companion to Michael Haneke (Wiley Blackwell, May 2010), an anthology of newly-commissioned work by various contributors that introduces one of the most important directors to have emerged on the global cinema scene in the past fifteen years. &lt;br /&gt;Reception to follow &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:30 pm &lt;b&gt;THE REBELLION &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Introduction by Roy Grundmann, Boston University  &lt;br /&gt;Andreas Pum lost his leg in World War I, fighting for his Emperor and homeland and firmly believing in law and order. All he receives as a thank you is a barrel organ and a license. One day he gets into a fight with a well-dressed gentleman and disturbs the peace. He loses his license, is thrown into prison and, after his release, has to clean toilets at the Café Halali. Only when he is near death does he realizes that he was much too well behaved all his life and followed too many rules. This film, based on the novel by Joseph Roth, was made for Austrian Television.  &lt;br /&gt;Austria 1993  &lt;br /&gt;DVD  &lt;br /&gt;color / b&amp;amp;w, 105 min  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it and once again I'd appreciate any suggestions, &lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tom will be holding a meetup sign outside before 2 pm and again during the book reception at 4 pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269303150000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Two Early M.
