<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This event will focus on &lt;strong&gt;strategy&lt;/strong&gt; games.  Unlike word games which focus on your language skills, card games which focus on your ability to create patterns and sets and party games which test your general knowledge and creativity, strategy games involve executive level functions.  For example, some games involve money management, others involve timing and planning ahead, some involve designing military planning etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of strategy games people in this group have been known to enjoy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 Wonders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutthroat Caverns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dominion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medici&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you like any of these games or want to learn more about this genre, this event will be for you.  We welcome new players with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will leave it up to group choice on what we play that night so please bring your favorites. We generally divide into smaller groups depending on group size and game preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have plenty to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats, but they will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to a 3 year old, who will be headed to bed as people arrive. We also have a fifteen month old, who isn't much of a game player, but he will eventually go to bed as well. Expect to see him awake while you are here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
