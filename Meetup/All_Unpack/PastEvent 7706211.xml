So, the plan is to do three rock climbing weekends again this year.  Similar format as to last years.  See plan below, in either case you have a choice of lessons with a guide, or organizing your own climb nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;August 30th.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it will work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Show up FRIDAY night, get your bunk, meet the people you'll be tied up with on Saturday&lt;br /&gt;2.  SATURDAY morning continental b'fast around 7am.  Grab your Wedeln lunch.&lt;br /&gt;         a.  at this point if you're not taking a lesson you are free to roam about.&lt;br /&gt;         b.  if you are taking a lesson go onto step 3.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Go to EMS and get gear and assigned a guide.  &lt;br /&gt;         a.  we will do our best to make sure the ratio is 3 to 1 climbers to guides&lt;br /&gt;         b.  we will sort people out by skill level - Newbie, climbed in doors, more advanced (may want to learn how to place rope etc)&lt;br /&gt;4.  Go climb!!! (small backpack, water, snacks, packed Wedeln lunch as you'll probably eat on the side of the mountain)&lt;br /&gt;5.  Return home triumphant to a Wedeln group meal&lt;br /&gt;6.  Saturday evening, hang out around bonfire before retiring to bed&lt;br /&gt;7.  SUNDAY wake up for continental b'fast at 8am.  At this point in time you are on your own for the day.  Hike, bike, shop, or go do more rock climbing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guide - $135 &lt;br /&gt;Food - $45 (includes 2 bfast, packed lunch, fluid, snacks, steaktip dinner, bonfire, and drinks - let me know if vegetarian or if there are any dietary restrictions). &lt;br /&gt;Guest fee lodging - $40 (non-eiscl members pay this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-Members Save $20 by booking the whole package &lt;br /&gt;Total is $199!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EICSL Members Save $60 by booking the package &lt;br /&gt;Total is $160&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We accept Visa &amp;amp; MasterCard &lt;br /&gt;Payment must be made by August 18th for the August 30th weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in attending this event payment must be made ASAP!
