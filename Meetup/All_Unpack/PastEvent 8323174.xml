So anyone can come that means couples are also welcome. Let's get to know one another and socialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This time the music will be half as loud in the main room and tuned very low or off in the back room so members can have a separate area to chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Kitty OSheas is in Boston (near Faneuil Hall) 131 State St Boston, MA 02109 617-725-0100 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kittyosheasboston.com/live/website/home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Kitty Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd floor can hold 150 people. There are 2 bars upstairs, 4 huge comfy couches, AC, its own DJ area with light machine and dance floor as well as its own bathroom, so we would truly have our own private party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering $210 worth of appetizers (Wings/veggie platter, cheeses etc) because their Kitchen is small and we will never get enough food for 150 members. The bar will cover the cost to refill any appetizer platters, so people can eat what they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cost gets us the whole 2nd floor, 3 bartenders and the DJ so its not all just to cover the food!&lt;br /&gt;I will ask EVERYONE whether you eat or not to please pay $5 to help cover the cost of this event. Please find Biagio &lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/887/members/3847345/"&gt;(his photo)&lt;/a&gt; at the party to pay him. He is the ONLY person you should pay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS ALWAYS YOU MUST MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note : After 9PM the bar charges a mandatory $10 cover just to get in so members must arrive before 9PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 9PM if we have over 100 people upstairs we can keep the 2nd floor to ourselves all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;In other words get there before 9PM so you don't have to pay the cover and we can have the 2nd floor to ourselves.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup Groups are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Social Fun - &lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/887/calendar/8308863/"&gt;http://socialnetwork....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metro Boston Active Singles 25-35 - &lt;a href="http://singles.meetup.com/1884/calendar/8333692/"&gt;http://singles.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single in the &amp;quot;City&amp;quot; Women's Social Group - &lt;a href="http://women.meetup.com/514/calendar/8328419/"&gt;http://women.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had about 185 members at the last Mix and Mingle cross Meetup party. There were also a few members who could not get in because they came to late and it was full. So, RSVP now and arrive early.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It should be fun and I hope you can all join us for this blast of a party! &lt;br /&gt;Ciao Biagio&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The whole second floor will be reserved for Meetup members</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218493924000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215813567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Mix + Mingle Part 3</name><id>8323174</id><headcount>33</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218321000000</time><rsvp_limit>41</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/8323174/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/1/global_4320785.jpeg</photo_url></item>
