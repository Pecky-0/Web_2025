It has provided a great community for like-minded software developers, managers and coaches to get together in a very informal way to discuss the ups and downs of using XP and other agile Software Development methods on a wide variety of projects in all sorts of organisations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar group formed in New York in January 2007, and the Boston group formed in September 2007.  The Boston group has since decided to move its meetings to Thursdays because of conflicts with other things on members' schedules.  We are currently planning to hold meetings on the first Thursday of each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January, five eXtreme Thursday members - Heather Kanzer, Jason Wadsworth, J.L. Holup, Moss Collum and Don Roby (yours truly) - met at Coogan's and had some quite good conversations in spite of having to converse over a rather loudly miked trivia question game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll keep trying out different locations in hopes of finding one more conducive to discussion. The decision to meet on Thursdays may continue to make this difficult, so we might at some point going back to Tuesdays. But not just yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next meeting will be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Thursday, February 7th from 6:30pm&lt;br /&gt;    * An Tain, 31 India St, Boston, MA 02110&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know this place, but it was recommended as a nearby possibility. It may of course have similar problems on a Thursday night. It definitely has entertainment that would interfere on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Don Roby</member_name><member_id>5713230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202611597000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Extreme Programmers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>xp-28</urlname><id>840210</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>eXtreme Tuesday Club - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199406660000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>eXtreme Thursday Club - Boston February Meetup</name><id>7025032</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202427000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/xp-28/events/7025032/</event_url></item>
