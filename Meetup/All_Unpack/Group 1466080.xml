The Urban Homesteadersâ€™ League is a community venture dedicated to inspiring and empowering individuals and communities to shift from a lifestyle of passive consumption to one of active participation, creation, and connection.

We are committed to re-imagining the good life as one that is meaningful, pleasurable, environmentally sustainable, and socially just. We place the home at the center of that pursuit and see it as a site for personal and societal transformation.

We teach workshops and skillshares on ecological urban agriculture, urban livestock, food preparation and preservation, making your own skincare products and cleaning supplies, urban composting, basic carpentry, green retrofitting, fiber arts, and sustainable urban living skills of all kinds. We organize potlucks, field trips, stuff swaps, film screenings, and conferences. We do many of these things in collaboration with other local groups and organizations. All our workshops and events are low cost or offered on a sliding scale basis.</description><rating>4.63</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1244047892000</created><lat>42.3699989319</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>234</id><urlkey>gardening</urlkey><name>Gardening</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2527</id><urlkey>permaculture</urlkey><name>Permaculture</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>3135</id><urlkey>newurbanism</urlkey><name>New Urbanism &amp; Sustainable Development</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>5915</id><urlkey>greenhome</urlkey><name>Green Home</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10155</id><urlkey>communitybuilders</urlkey><name>Community Builders</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17626</id><urlkey>cooking-and-baking</urlkey><name>Cooking and Baking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18527</id><urlkey>homesteading</urlkey><name>Homesteading</name></topics_item></topics><name>The Urban Homesteaders' League</name><id>1466080</id><members>1974</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>9817670</member_id><name>Nicola Williams</name></organizer><urlname>Urban-Homesteaders-League</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/c/1/600_8961441.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/c/1/highres_8961441.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>8961441</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/c/1/thumb_8961441.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Cambridge</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Urban-Homesteaders-League/</link><lon>-71.0999984741</lon></item>
