&lt;p&gt;Lots of very interesting people. Mostly rock n roll, motown, soul, &amp;amp; some blues. Very upbeat. But, if anyone gets tired here, four blocks down there is the Middle East practically next door which has no cover either. Belly dancing music&amp;nbsp;w/ extremely well rehearsed live dancers. Starting at ten PM ending around 11PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>duncan </member_name><member_id>9836304</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301410311000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>NO COVER! Officially Cantab Sun's is an open mike but as it turns out there is a house band competition, &amp; that is good; the MC keeps the musicians hot on their toes vying for time. It begins early for a Sunday, 9PM. Then people start dancing.</why><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1300068227000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Cantab Lounge free dancing and LIVE music.</name><id>16910415</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301274000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/16910415/</event_url></item>
