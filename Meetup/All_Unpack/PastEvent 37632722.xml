They are also providing complimentary chips/salsa. There is a full cash bar available and members are welcome to order their own additional food too. This will be a great night! Be sure to bring socks with you for bowling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please only sign up if you can definitely attend since this will be a popular event. If your plans change, please update your RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
