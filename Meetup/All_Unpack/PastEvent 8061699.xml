Lets meet in front of Dunkin Donuts at the corner of the World Trade Center at 7.15 pm. The boat is right around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make it then, just be sure to be on the boat before 8 pm. Its probably best to get your dinner before you arrive as any refreshments on board will probably be of the liquid variety. Its also advisable to bring a light jacket in case it gets cold out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Steffen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. make sure to remember your printed E-tickets if you bought your ticket online !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are still available at $25 each or 2 for $40 if you purchase them online at the link below ($30 each at the gate). Please purchase your tickets through the official webpage to guarantee your spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostoneventguide.com/events/spc6_08.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostoneven...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time:&lt;br /&gt;Boarding at 7:15pm, departing at 8:00pm sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;The boat is the MV Provincetown II at Bay State Cruise Co. located at 200 Seaport Blvd on the Commonwealth Pier. The Pier goes around the Boston side of the World Trade Center/Seaport Building. &lt;br /&gt;The best way to get there is by the Silver Line bus from South Station to the airport. Get off at the World Trade Center stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking:&lt;br /&gt;Ample lot parking is available starting at $8. If you park at Anthony's or one of the surrounding lots just walk past the Seaport Bar then take an immediate left before the World Trade Center onto the Commonwealth Pier. The boat is halfway down the pier.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steffen</member_name><member_id>3796675</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214089567000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212426452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summer Party Cruise</name><id>8061699</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213916400000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/8061699/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/e/9/global_4330841.jpeg</photo_url></item>
