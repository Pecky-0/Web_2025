<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the weather likes to screw me over again. &amp;nbsp;When I want to host an outdoor event, it rains. &amp;nbsp;When I want to host an indoor event, it becomes sunny and hot... :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the awesome weather forecasted for this Sunday, I've decided to supplement my day plans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anybody wants to play games on Sunday, but rather spend the day enjoying the weather and eating ice cream during daylight first, I will open up my place for an open house gaming event starting at 6pm. &amp;nbsp;That way you can have your ice cream and eat it too since Monday is a holiday and I have no problem playing into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No theme, we can play whatever. &amp;nbsp;I have my collection of board games, some new dice games as well as my Wii. &amp;nbsp;So utilize my games or bring your own. &amp;nbsp;And probably a good idea to bring a snack or drink to share as I will have limited stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
