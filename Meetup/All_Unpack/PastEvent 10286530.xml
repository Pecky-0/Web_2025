<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This weekend's weather does not look promising so I was hoping to squeeze in some play on Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;This is obviously short notice so I hope some people can show up.  I am only going if there are &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVPs by 4:00 pm Wednesday afternoon.  Soooo...if you say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, please plan on showing up.  That's it for now.  Hope to play with the group tomorrow and don't forget to bring fluids.  As usual, the alternate location (if the courts are occupied) is Wolcott Park around the corner on New Britain Ave.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue Nike Hat &amp;  bandana tied to the fence</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241212451000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240942411000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Night Tennis</name><id>10286530</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241038800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/10286530/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_2940738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
