<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>After a successful opening meeting, we can focus on developing some fundamental skills of improv. Look forward to drills and warmups designed to get us more carefully listening to and observing fellow performers. This work will help reinforce the important concept of getting outside of one's head. Next, we'll practice the concept of yes, and-ing, a core principle of good improvisation. Finally, we'll end by doing a few games that'll give us the chance to practice what we've learned.
