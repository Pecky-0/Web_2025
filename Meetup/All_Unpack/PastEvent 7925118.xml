(It has fantastic views.)  It's about 2.2 miles up the Dublin &lt;br /&gt;trail, it usually takes just over an hour.  Add time for a group hike. The Pumpelly trail is about &lt;br /&gt;4.5 miles to the summit, and usually takes about two hours in one &lt;br /&gt;direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.qcc.mass.edu/brink/Trav-rec/mt_monad/mmdublin.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Dublin Trail information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.qcc.mass.edu/brink/Trav-rec/mt_monad/images/duMM060421.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;There are two ways to reach the head of the Dublin Trail: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;From Rt. 101,&lt;/u&gt; take Lake Road, about 0.7 km (~0.5 miles) west of Dublin Center. The Dublin Trail head with bulletin board on the right.That's a left turn if you're heading west. Be sure not to turn down either Upper Jaffrey Road, which has a sign for the Monadnock State Park, or Snow Hill Road. Follow this for 3.24 km (2 miles) as it becomes Old Marlborough Rd and goes well past the lake, to Old Troy Road, on your left opposite the Dublin Country Club.   Take Old Troy Road 2.43 km (~1.6 miles), continuing after it becomes a dirt road, to the trail head, on your left. (Old Troy Road becomes Old Dublin Road when you cross into the town of Troy. USGS topo maps may refer to the entire road as Old Dublin Road.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;From Rt. 124,&lt;/u&gt; take Old Dublin Road northeasterly (on the right if you're heading west) for 5 km (~3.2 miles), mostly dirt, until you reach the parking area on the left. You'll pass a couple of side roads off to the right; make sure you stay left--I don't think there are any roads to the left, but I can't guarantee it. (One of the roads you will pass is Shaker Farm Road North, the other end of Shaker Farm Road South which brings you to the Marlboro Trail. Resist the temptation to take it to the Marlboro Trail; it is in very rough shape.) &amp;quot;No Parking&amp;quot; signs are found along the road in this area.From either direction, this is a well maintained road, very narrow and dark under heavy tree cover. Note that it is not maintained in the winter. Alternatively, from Marlborough stay on Rt. 101 and watch for Lake Rd., about 10.78 km (~6.5 miles). Turn right onto Lake Rd. and follow it to the end. Turn right and at Old Dublin Road, turn left, following it for about 2.93 km (~1.9 miles). (Old Dublin Road becomes Old Troy Road when you cross into the town of Dublin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a parking area on the right down a short driveway, with room for about 20 cars. &amp;quot;No Parking&amp;quot; signs are found along the road in this area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/3/e/event_2365150.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 yes RSVP's create a meetup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.qcc.mass.edu/brink/Trav-rec/mt_monad/mmsuggest.html" target="_blank"&gt;Hiking Trails of Mt Monadnock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its thousands of acres of protected highlands, 3,165-ft. Mt. Monadnock was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1987. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 40 miles of maintained foot trails, many of which lead to the bare rock summit through unique alpine vegetation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsurpassed 100-mile views to points in all six New England states are the reward for a climb. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A magnet for hikers, Monadnock is said to be the second most frequently climbed mountain in the world, after Japan's Mt. Fuji.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the &lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/283/pages/disclaimer/"&gt;NEHAAG disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hiker profile is complete so we can verify that your qualified to join us on this moderately rated mountain hike. Although not a 4000 ft hike, this is quite a workout with lots of boulder climbing. Proper clothing and footwear is a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling is always advised and a great way to get to know your fellow members.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Trailhead is not easy to find .
