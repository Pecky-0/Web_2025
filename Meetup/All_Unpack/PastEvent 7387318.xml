He got cold feet and ran for the hills and he?s been going in circles ever since.  When Dennis discovers Libby?s hooked up with high-flying-go-getter Whit (Hank Azaria), he realizes it?s now or never.  He enters a marathon to show he?s more than a quitter, but then finds out just how much sweat, strain and tears it takes to change.  Nobody gives him a chance but Dennis knows this is his only hope to be more than a running joke.  But does Dennis have the stuff to trade his cold feet for running shoes?  RUN, FAT BOY, RUN is a romantic comedy that affirms that true love isn?t a sprint, it?s a marathon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chelsea</member_name><member_id>3861711</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212077726000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Simon Pegg's last films, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz have become cult classics among film enthusiasts.
