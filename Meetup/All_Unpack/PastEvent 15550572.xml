One can barely see one's hand in front of one's face when stepping outside!  A few luckless souls tend to disappear when a blizzard like this one rolls in. Some villagers just brought one poor drifter in, and it looks like he's been frozen since things began days ago-  and somebody swears up and down that they saw him outside earlier today!  Is there some strange magic at work? Was it a ghost that was seen... or was it something more sinister?  Come join us for a night of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (and other games as well), take on the role of a fantasy hero, and solve the mystery!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ages 6-10 play from 6:30-8:30 PM; ages 11+ play until 9:30. Call us at 781-270-4800 to pre-register; $15/member, $20/nonmember. At the door: $20/member, $25/nonmember.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292114694000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290640120000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Night:  Cold Reflection</name><id>15550572</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292110200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/15550572/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/e/global_6162670.jpeg</photo_url></item>
