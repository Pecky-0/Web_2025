Have you ever wondered what it would be like to wander a corn field at night with nothing more than your wits and flashlights to guide you? Who knows what kind of evils could be lurking in the field. Who knows, you may even meet &amp;quot;He who walks behind the rows&amp;quot;. Are you going to brave the corn fields or are you going to use some lame excuse and stay home? Who knows, gentlemen you may just become a hero for a lady in distress and who knows ladies you might meet your hero. More important, you might have some fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is not a scary maze, but it should be a lot of fun.  They are meant for the whole family.  Bring your flashlight!   Cost for the night maze is $10.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhcornmaze.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhcornmaze...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Coppal House Maze:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sculptured corn field is designed to challenge your navigational abilities!  Marvel at this amazing feat of agricultural engineering, as you make your way through living walls of corn that are over 8 feet tall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year marks the third year of having a corn maze!  Each spring they plant a very large corn field.  When the corn grows to about knee high, it is transformed into a corn maze.  The maze is professionally designed and cut. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 2007 corn maze design is a &amp;quot;Coyote Howling at the Moon&amp;quot;!  The actual size of the corn maze is just over 6-acres!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Seacoast/Exeter Area:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 101W to Exit 7 (Route 125)&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Route 125, travel 4.2 miles&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Route 155, travel 2.2 miles&lt;br /&gt;We're on your left hand side!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Manchester Area:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 101E to Exit 7 (Route 125)&lt;br /&gt;Turn left onto Route 125, travel 4.2 miles&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Route 155, travel 2.2 miles&lt;br /&gt;We're on your left hand side!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Massachusetts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 95N to Exit 2 in NH.&lt;br /&gt;Go through the tolls, bearing right onto 101W towards Manchester&lt;br /&gt;Take Exit 7 (Route 125)&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Route 125, travel 4.2 miles&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Route 155, travel 2.2 miles&lt;br /&gt;We're on your left hand side!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Maine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take I-95 South to Exit 5 (Route 4 / Route 16) towards US-1 Bypass&lt;br /&gt;Newington/Portsmouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merge onto Route 16 North Spaulding Turnpike, travel 4.4 miles&lt;br /&gt;Merge onto US-4W via Exit 6W towards US-202 Dover Point/Concord&lt;br /&gt;Travel 9.9 miles&lt;br /&gt;Enter turnabout and take 3rd exit onto Calef Road/Route 125 South.&lt;br /&gt;Travel 1.7 miles, turn left onto George Bennett Road&lt;br /&gt;Travel 7/10 mile&lt;br /&gt;Turn slight right onto Route 155, travel 1 mile&lt;br /&gt;We're on your right hand side, across from Blue Bell Greenhouses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Car Pool From Nashua:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the Exit 6 Welcome Center at 5:30 PM.
