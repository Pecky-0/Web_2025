So many new members come from all over the world, even from so far away they can't actually come to the Meetups. We have members who are very experienced in all aspects of the industry, and many who are beginners looking to find help from you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have fun, great networking time, and projects to get involved in. I look forward to seeing familar faces and new members at the next Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;Shirley, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you give us your profile as you RSVP especially if you are an older member before the rquirements for joining. It is very important in order to classify you according to your fashion products, servives or even your aspirations and explorations, and to properly set up our Meetups. There are many people looking for fashion people in all aspects of the industry. Let them know what you do so they can find you in our Network Database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see my &amp;quot;Fashion Solutions Blog&amp;quot;, for answering designers questions and assisting them in creativity &amp;amp; technical pattern &amp;amp; production, linked to this meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://fashionsolutions.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://fashionsolutio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see also my web site  [url=http://www.shirleywillett.com]&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180057401000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177024010000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Fashion Industry May Meetup</name><id>5688257</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179439200000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/5688257/</event_url></item>
