&lt;p&gt;Join us as we welcome Yaron Brook, president of the Ayn Rand Institute. Born and raised in Israel, Yaron served as a first sergeant in Israeli military intelligence and earned a BSc in civil engineering from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel. Yaron admits to being a socialist until the age of 16–then he read Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. Despite his best efforts to poke holes in Rand’s arguments, he couldn’t, and went on to become a student of Rand’s philosophy, Objectivism. His articles have been featured in major publications such as the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Investor’s Business Daily, and he is a frequent guest on radio and TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yaron will be discussing his new book Free Market Revolution. &lt;br /&gt;

 Cost: $10 for lecture, $30 for lecture and a copy of Free Market Revolution. Light refreshments will be served. Register at: &lt;br /&gt;
