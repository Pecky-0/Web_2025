&lt;p&gt;Meet in the parking lot at the base of the mountain. We may go across the road and explore the 'other' side of this extensive conservation area. Did you know there's a large lake with cliffs rising above it where Kittery and Eliot get some of their drinking water? No? I didn't think so...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.agamenticus.org/recreation.html"&gt;Mount Agamenticus Conservation Region&lt;/a&gt; consists of more than 10,000 acres and is located within an additional 30,000-acre expanse of conservation land in southern Maine.&amp;nbsp; This land is comprised of a rich and unique coastal forest that supports the highest diversity of animal and plant species in all of Maine.&amp;nbsp; The mountain and the surrounding area provide residents with an ideal location for hiking, biking and sightseeing.&amp;nbsp; While most of Southern Maine is heavily developed, this stretch of conservation land is a natural treasure that will be preserved for the enjoyment of generations to come.&amp;nbsp; Mount A&amp;rsquo;s trails are for hikers, bikers, equestrians and ATV riders. &amp;nbsp;To ensure long-term trail quality and to protect against erosion, trails are designated for specific uses.&amp;nbsp; Trail signs, color blazes and the trail map tell which uses are permitted on each trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.agamenticus.org/recreation.html" style="color : #441f13"&gt;Mount Agamenticus&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is one of the many lost ski resorts of New England. There still stands traces of the ski slopes and lift systems which are now merely relics.&amp;nbsp; The Mountain Top Lodge though still exists and has been kept open for groups.&lt;/p&gt;
