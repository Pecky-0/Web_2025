&lt;p&gt;The route: &lt;a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=5751503" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=5751503&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 We start out from the Lexington Depot and hit a medium-sized hill right away, just to make sure we are all in the same boat and ready for a 37-mile 12-14mph ride :) Then we head out scenic Marrett Rd, into Lincoln where we hit the biggest climb of the ride, Lincoln Hill. The next 7 miles are my favorite part, quietly winding south through Lincoln and Sudbury. We do 1 mile of Rt 27 to cross the Sudbury River, and then head north for 10 scenic miles to our rest stop in Concord Center (at the 26-mile mark). Then we finish up with Monument St to Rt 225 to the Minuteman Bikeway back to the Lexington Depot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: &lt;br /&gt;

 Let's meet up at 12:00pm and be ready to start at 12:15pm. Aiming to be back by 3:45pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where: &lt;br /&gt;

 Lexington Depot, right by the water fountain. Parking is free on Sundays in the big lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who: &lt;br /&gt;

 You need to be okay with a 12-14 mph average pace, and some significant hills. We will wait for everyone at the top of major hills and at confusing intersections, but otherwise we want to keep a decent pace going.&lt;/p&gt;
