We will be meeting at the Portland Public Library in Monument Squre in Portland, ME.  Let me know if you need directions.   During this meet-up, we'll have a chance to meet each other face to face, learn about the state of animal welfare in Maine and I'll be looking for guidance as to what particular areas you'd like to focus on.   Due to the timeliness of the situation, I'm sure the puppy mill issue is on everyone's hot list.   We can discuss that issue as well as some of the other big issues in Maine right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and let us know if there is something in particular you'd like to talk about!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542160000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189797726000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Maine Animal Welfare Meet-Up- The status of Maine's animals</name><id>6360170</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192141800000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/6360170/</event_url></item>
