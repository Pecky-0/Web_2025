Bicyclers are welcome (joanna), and wheels down at 10am sharp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: The Bourne Scallop Festival is located 50-yards from the parking lot, I will be going there after roller blading for a $20.00 scallop lunch and live music at noon if anyone is interested. For those not into Scallops there is grilled food available, there is a $5:00 entrance fee.&lt;/p&gt;
