&lt;p&gt;If its a nice day we could have lunch afterwards at Jody's Place. They have outdoor seating.

Hard to say for sure what the weather will be, but right now they are saying clear and 72 degrees for the 28th.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335795296000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335016841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anyone interested in the spring open house at Lake St. Garden Center -Salem, NH?</name><id>61517462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335621600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/61517462/</event_url></item>
