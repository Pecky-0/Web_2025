We will actually have a portion of our meeting devoted to the analysis of REAL DEALS that any of our players are currently working on.  This was recommended at our last meetup and we are psyched to bring it to fruition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's how it will work:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Email me your deal (don't include the address)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Make sure you have done your due diligence, and be informed&lt;br /&gt;3.  We only have time for two deals, so if there are more than that emailed to me, I'll just choose two.  The other(s) can be discussed AFTER Cashflow, for anyone who wishes to stay.&lt;br /&gt;4.  We will stop right at 3pm and begin playing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time that we do this, so your suggestions will be appreciated.  At any rate, we look forward to seeing you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual Cashflow game....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANY EXPERIENCE LEVEL IS WELCOME!! We always have some who have never played before as well as veterans. We will shoot for having a 202 board, but as always we reserve that board for those who have gotten out of the Rat Race at least five times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting in the lobby of the Marino Rec Center at NU's campus.  Just look for the tall shaven-headed guy with a purple RICH DAD bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is parking on Hemenway Street. Even though it says Fenway Resident, I have never gotten a ticket there. However, if you do, you're on your own. If you have any trouble finding us, please feel free to call my cell (617-519-3163).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE ON TIME!!! We will start PROMPTLY at three.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're looking forward to seeing you ALL there on Sunday November 22!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ &lt;br /&gt;617-519-3163&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259091577000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257471109000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cashflow and Deal Evaluation</name><id>11808112</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258918200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/11808112/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
