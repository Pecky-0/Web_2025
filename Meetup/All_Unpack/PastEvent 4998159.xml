<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Testing the waters to see if more people would like to meet on a weekend day. I'll be there just looking to meet some more people and hang out for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only one or two people can make it to the event. I'll most likely cancel it. I know some people have family/friend weekend commitments but a couple of people mentioned only being able to attend something on the weekend so I'm testing the availability of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll still continue with the weekday meetups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.pandemoniumbooks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pandemoniumbooks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pandemoniu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1151431574000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>United Dungeons &amp; Dragons July Meetup Day</name><id>4998159</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1152378000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/4998159/</event_url></item>
