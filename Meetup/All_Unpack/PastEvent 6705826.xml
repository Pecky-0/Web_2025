Like we did last year we are also inviting the Aussies to help bring in some Christmas cheer.  We will be meeting at 7:30 PM by the bar at Kings.  After having dinner and/or drinks we'll play some pool and bowling.   Come down to Kings and have a beer with your Australian cousins!  Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew</member_name><member_id>2881088</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542564000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194570724000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Expat Canadian December Meetup- Commonwealth Christmas Party</name><id>6705826</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197678600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/6705826/</event_url></item>
