Last meetup for this ride cancelled because of weather. This is a ride of 5 miles from Warren to Bristol each way, and if other members want to they can ride longer as this is a great place to ride,and it's so much more fun to ride with a group of awesome people, including hipsters,A-listers, bored Euro -Trash, and recent parole's from club Fed! Sounds Cool doesn't it? Hopefully weather will co-operate this time, I look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334686810000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>15</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>41</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333211061000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reschuled Meetup, East Bay Bike Path, Warren, R.I. to Bristol R.I. </name><id>58660432</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334419200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/58660432/</event_url></item>
