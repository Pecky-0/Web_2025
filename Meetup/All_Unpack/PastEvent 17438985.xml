I'd like to get together with a group of a few folks on a nice day somewhere around the Middletown area. There are lots of great places to shoot portraits around here, like Gillette Castle, Wadsworth Mansion, around Wesleyan, run-down buildings (ha!) etc. I'm open to suggestions from anyone with an interest! I can bring along some reflectors and other modifiers that we can use and I thought we could each rotate as assistant, subject, and photographer, if that makes sense. There's an opportunity for a really great collaborative learning experience!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1311452555000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Spring is in full swing and I'd like to meet other people with an interest in creative portraiture!</why><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>shootout</urlname><id>1362724</id><group_lat>41.5499992371</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6600036621</group_lon><name>Connecticut Photography Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1303834416000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Location Portraiture Collaboration</name><id>17438985</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1311447600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/shootout/events/17438985/</event_url></item>
