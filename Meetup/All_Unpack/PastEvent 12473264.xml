This is a family event and children are welcome! As the light overtakes the darkness, we celebrate the warmth and beauty of the awakening Earth and this day paves the way for the coming lushness of summer. Ostara is a time when all elements within and without us are brought into harmony. A time of new life and rebirth, as well as the end of Winter! We plan on meeting at Veasey Memorial Park, 201 Washington St, Groveland MA, rain or shine.&lt;br /&gt;Service starts at 5:00 AM sharp. Check &lt;a href="http://www.veaseypark.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.veaseypark...&lt;/a&gt; for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress warmly in layers, bring your drums and rattles, and get ready to have a very good time coaxing the first rays of light up over the clouds. The ritual is followed by a potluck breakfast. And who knows, there may just be Ostara Eggs around to hunt for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderfully enriching, educational and fun event. Learn about different ways of celebrating the turns of the Wheel of the Year, meet new people and learn to share personal experiences, stories, laughter and joy in the spirit of the seasons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check &lt;a href="http://www.MoonPool.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.MoonPool.o...&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269378390000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264950441000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunrise Ostara Celebration / Vernal Equinox</name><id>12473264</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269162000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/12473264/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
