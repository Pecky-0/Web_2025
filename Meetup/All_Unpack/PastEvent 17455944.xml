&lt;p&gt;This meetup is held in conjunction with Bostons Freeing Our SpaceTime for Level-10 Living Meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT HAS VALUE - to &lt;em&gt;you, personally?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; What doesn't, so much? ...And &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; Here is help to focus on what is important to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, to release more easily the many other (probably very good) things that distract you from being your very best.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's have a discussion and discovery about this.&amp;nbsp; Often when we  look at something from a different point of view, we see things we did  not notice before. The same is true about cluttering - be that physical  or mental.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;If you plan to eat, please arrive by 6:30 pm to order&lt;/strong&gt;; otherwise, by 7 pm will be fine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;There is no specified purchase minimum for refreshments,  but participants are encouraged to order &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;thing to support the  business, in appreciation of Management's permission to meet in their space.&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Please be advised: Commercial eating establishments generally do &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; permit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;on-site &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;consumption of refreshments brought in from elsewhere, due  to liability concerns, so please be considerate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGENDA (timeline may vary a little) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 pm- Order dinner/refreshment if you plan to eat: $2.45 (for a soda) and upward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:00 pm- Intro to neurolinguistic programming (NLP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:15 pm- Roots of clutter: Cluttered thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30 pm&amp;ndash; NLP technique(s) described&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:45 pm - Demonstration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:30 pm- Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:45 pm- Wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; Calendar to schedule Action Items   (next  steps), notepad &amp;amp; pen  or other note-taking device.  Dress in   layers (e.g., wear a sweater in  case the restaurant is cooler  than   you'd prefer) and comfortably, as  Kevin might have us all do  NLP/EFT   exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is one recent "case study" I can offer in rediscovering Value  that I had overlooked routinely in the seeming clutter within my home:  while putting back decorative knick knacks on some kitchen corner  shelves following a painter's visit last week, I found myself  on  autopilot returning to the shelves some liqueurs in their interesting  little bottles ...  when it occurred to me they'd been up there for  decades and I had no plans to invite people for dinner or dessert anytime soon, so I thought to myself, why not use these now, myself- at the very least to further my decluttering objectives?&amp;nbsp; The result has been delightful:&amp;nbsp; I  now drizzle fresh cut fruit  with amaretto or Grand Marnier, creating  luscious concoctions for evening snacks!&amp;nbsp; You can do something similar,  I'm sure ... just think:&amp;nbsp; how might you achieve a simple  "clutter Victory" - this very weekend - perhaps by utilizing something  you've been saving for a special time or person(s) that never  materialized (and very possibly won't)? (For decades I'd served guests  desserts other than fruit in liqueur- so, I totally forgot I even had these ingredients on hand!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another thought, loosely related ... more philosophical: in society, income comes from or through at least one other person with whom we've somehow interacted, perhaps indirectly, at some point. Finance is social ... so, perhaps the "Social Growth" subject that's been at least noted  and tracked (is it still?), if not graded in elementary schools, might  well be relabeled to better reflect the valuable financial aspect of  human interaction, too? -to expand people's awareness of the broader   significance of "social growth," even at an early age...to not seem so  much a "throw-away  subject" as kids such as I was might otherwise  consider it to be. Life can be a hard master in the subject later on, if  such lessons  aren't learned early...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come join us!&amp;nbsp; (Or specify a better time and place for you  to do so; we'll try to schedule another meeting soon.)&amp;nbsp; Share your ideas  and achievements- let's have some **FUN** with this, Guys!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
