&lt;p&gt;They also have a full menu there now and everything I have tried had been really good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you turn in to the office park area go straight back towards the lake - the hotel is along the lakeside.  The bar/restaurant is to the far LEFT if you are facing the building..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will score some seats ALONG THE WINDOWS... come early to help save them if you want to!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Used to be called the Lord Wakefield Hotel.
