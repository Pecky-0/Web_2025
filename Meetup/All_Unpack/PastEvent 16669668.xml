You should make arrangements with him on how to get the tickets and prepay for them. If you RSVP make sure you contact him at the same time to make arrangements. If you RSVP - and take the spot you will owe him the $15 whether you go or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a high energy show. The music is great and the crowd will be dancing all night. If any of you have not been, it's a nice little restaurant in downtown Wareham.
