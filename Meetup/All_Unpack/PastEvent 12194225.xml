Each guest will be able to make 5 greeting cards of your own design. &lt;b&gt;There is a $7 fee for each guest for card making supplies for the evening.&lt;/b&gt;  If you'd like, you can make some cards to send to children in hospital or the elderly in nursing homes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be making some homemade cupcakes and will have some appetizers for us all to enjoy. Please bring your beverage of choice (all drinks are welcome!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a fun evening- try an engaging and creative activity, meet some friendly and interesting people and enjoy good food and drinks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting at my place in Hopedale. The exact address will be emailed to those who have signed up, a couple of days before the event. Look forward to seeing you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Catherine </member_name><member_id>6146290</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265761970000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>metrowestyoungprofessionals</urlname><id>951974</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>Metro West Young Professionals Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262400079000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Evening of Cards, Cupcakes and Cocktails!</name><id>12194225</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265414400000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/metrowestyoungprofessionals/events/12194225/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/global_9282182.jpeg</photo_url></item>
