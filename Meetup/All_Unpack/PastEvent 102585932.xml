(Because most of the speakers could not assume that their audience consisted of experts, the lectures generally serve as a great introduction to the topic.) Second, glance over (but do not yet try to answer) the study questions. Finally - and this will take the bulk of the week's time - tackle the reading(s), answering the study questions as you go along. Write down any questions that arise as you go through the materials and we will go over these and the study questions when we meet up each Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
