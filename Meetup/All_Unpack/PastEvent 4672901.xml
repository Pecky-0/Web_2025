<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I thought I'd post this so people were aware of it, I didn't know if people would want to go as a group or randomly run into one another.  I'm meeting my friend Katie on Saturday there as we do this together annually.  I will probably also go on Sunday. The website is www.yankeeshepherd.com and they have a schedule of events on the site somewhere, demos, sheep to shawl  and lectures and classes.  Admission is $5.00 for adults. Directions to the fairground are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: From I-93, take I-89 in Concord. Get off at Exit 7 and turn right on Rte. 103. From Vermont, take I-89 to Exit 7 and turn left on Rte. 103. From Keene, follow 9/202 to I-89. Go north to Exit 7 and turn right on Rte. 103. Follow Rte. 103/Park Avenue. The fairgrounds will be on your right. The entrance is at the Blue Gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>1774915</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1127220027000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Knitters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>knitting-486</urlname><id>179362</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Concord Knitting Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1114787625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NH Sheep and Wool Festival - Saturday</name><id>4672901</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1116075600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/knitting-486/events/4672901/</event_url></item>
