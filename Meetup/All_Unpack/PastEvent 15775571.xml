We are forming a 'Cookies Committee' to provide the 'desert' table at a special non profit event: The People's Music Network, Winter Gathering 2011 to be hosted in Hartford on Friday, January 28th. In brief, for reasons to many to list, there will be limited food served at the concert, where 800 people are expected to attend. There will be a desert table, or as we have come to call it, a Cookie Counter. The plan is to organize, bake up a storm of treats and present and sell the treats at the concert. The Cookie Committee has its first team meeting on December 27 at 6:30 pm at the house of David Kaplan, a non baker with great aspirations. If you have interest in any part of this project: planning, organizing, shopping, baking, serving the goodies, please attend the meeting. Hey, we may only need the one meeting unless it is so much fun that we do two. Note that the concert is sponsored by the non profit PMN. The show has listed 8 acts performing with the headliner being Pete Seeger. All donations made at our Cookie Counter, after expenses, will go to PMN as a donation. Those lucky enough to be working the Cookie Counter are of course right there for the concert.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be the one that looks like me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293680510000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292802392000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pete Seeger PMN Cookie Counter Committee Meeting</name><id>15775571</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293492600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/15775571/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/3/global_20359475.jpeg</photo_url></item>
