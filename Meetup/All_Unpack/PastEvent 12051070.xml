Due to some last minute scheduling issues, some people couldn't make it last week, so let's try again. Not to mention their food is so good, it's okay to try another item on the menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't spent much time on Thayer street, but maybe we can find a nightspot for a post dinner beverage. If you want to meet up after dinner instead, please email me for my cell so we can coordinate at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another suggestion is for anyone interested to go to the RISD music fridays for Salsa music then meet us out on Thayer afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I'll try to be at Twist by 6:45.&lt;br /&gt;- val&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260749137000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260365797000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Twist &amp; Thayer - Friday night</name><id>12051070</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260576000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/12051070/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
