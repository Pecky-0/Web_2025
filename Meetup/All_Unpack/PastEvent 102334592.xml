&lt;p&gt;Steel and Rye is Miltonâ€™s newest Restauant in a renovated garage setting. High cathedral like ceilings, lots of wood, steel and windows make this a unique setting. Look up and you can see some of the garage equipment turned into chic urban art. They also pride themselves in their multitude of rye selections at the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have our own private room with a cash bar. There will be a selection of appetizer servings for your tasting pleasure. You can also wander into the main bar area for appetizers or dinner on your own if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a parking lot next to the restaurant and lots of on-street parking in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out their website at steelandrye.com and join us for this new After Work venue&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have our own private room...ask for the Sitzers</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363637702000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Active "People" people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1425</urlname><id>1283834</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Sitzundjibers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359651812000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ides of March afterwork!</name><id>102334592</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363212000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1425/events/102334592/</event_url></item>
