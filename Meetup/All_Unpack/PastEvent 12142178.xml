Our trail system was specifically designed for cross-country skiing. New this year, we have widened our trails to accommodate skating. Practice your turns and stops in a wide open field, ski along brooks and stone walls and challenge your downhill skills on Outer Limits. We groom and track 12 miles of trails daily. Our northern exposure guarantees the best snow in the Berkshires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounding the Farm is two thousand acres of state and private land &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>A large Peter Pan Bus </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ira Wettenstein</member_name><member_id>5032313</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265640147000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261663401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Ira's- 2nd Annual Day of Play in Winter Wonderland-Canterbury Farm</name><id>12142178</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265466600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/12142178/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/9/global_12376217.jpeg</photo_url></item>
