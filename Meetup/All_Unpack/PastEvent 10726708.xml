So I am inviting you all to my humble abode to watch the film &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twelve Angry Jurors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an awesome 90s film version of the play.  I will make popcorn!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below, the Amazon.com review on the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SYNOPSIS: This 1997 cable-TV adaptation of 12 Angry Men presents the same plot as the two previous productions: the 1954 Studio One television version directed by Frank Schaffner and the 1957 film version directed by Sidney Lumet. Like the other two versions, it brings the viewer right into the jury room to watch the deliberators shout, plead, squirm, cajole, vote, then vote again and again until they reach a verdict in a case trying a young Hispanic for murder. Unlike the other versions, however, this one features a black racist (Mykelti Williamson) instead of a white racist to demonstrate that bigotry is not a whites-only disease. It also introduces other minority jurors, including black juror Ossie Davis and Hispanic juror Edward James Olmos, as well as a woman judge (Mary McDonnell) to reflect the changing times. Except for occasional profanity, the dialogue is essentially the same as in the previous versions, since all three are children of a script by playwright Reginald Rose. Generally, the actors perform well in this new adaptation. Aging Jack Lemmon portrays the pivotal juror who early on votes in opposition to the other 11 members, then plants doubts, saying, &amp;quot;Suppose we're wrong.&amp;quot; Although he lacks the full acting vigor and depth displayed in earlier roles, he still has enough fire to ignite an argument. George C. Scott, Courtney Vance, Dorian Harewood, James Gandolfini, and the other cast members perform ably -- some as ranters and ravers, others as timid men of conscience who stand their ground -- as the jurors grudgingly bow to logic and gradually accept the possibility that they could be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I live there!
