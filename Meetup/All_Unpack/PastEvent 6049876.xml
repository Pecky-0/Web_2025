A very very big classic, with oodles of characters and plot lines. So read as much as you can. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone else interested, I've changed the RSVP as we're going to try meeting outside, which means we don't necessarily have to limit to restaurant fitting size.  If we get too huge, we'll just split into 2 groups and chat side by side.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting on the steps of Lehman Hall (also called Dudley House) at 7 pm, and will chose a spot to sit in once everyone is present.  Please try to be on time, as the longer we wait, the less chatting we get to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring something to eat and drink, I'll be snagging a sandwich and bringing some chips or other goodies to share.  I'll bring a couple blankets as well to make sitting more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cathy</member_name><member_id>4263429</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187392304000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184890151000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Meetup</name><id>6049876</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187218800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/6049876/</event_url></item>
