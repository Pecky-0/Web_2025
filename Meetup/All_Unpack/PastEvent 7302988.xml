They are a really ecclectic place with a lot of variety.  You pick your food items, then they cook it on this huge central grill- it's really neat!  I was told breakfast style items are served from 10-12 then lunch style items become available around noon.   Brunch is $13.95 all you can eat, drinks are an additional charge.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am making a reservation for 10 people, so that will be the maximum number of people to RSVP.  In addition, I am eliminating maybe responses in order to allow those who really want to attend to get a spot.  If this event fills up, please RSVP &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; with a comment to be wait listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to help defray the cost of hosting a group on meetup, I would like to ask all members who attend meetups to contribute a dollar at alternating events.  There will be no real tracking of this, but it would just be a good will donation to help me out.  Thanks all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is going to be fun and I look forward to meeting everyone.  Yay brunch!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the one in the picture with the red hair :-)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205247834000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>You will get good food and great conversation with people who have similar interests(well at least in brunch anyway)...</why><group><who>Friends who brunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Brunch-Bunch</urlname><id>964634</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch !</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202659828000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch!
