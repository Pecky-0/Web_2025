And friends of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this isn't the perfect beach sand front for dog ocean swimming, it is a place where dogs are EXPECTED to be with no leash restriction while in the water and in the vicinity!  Yay!  On a site I'm posting a link to it states dogs on leash and not in picnic area.  We'll just avoid that area. The water and trails are away from that so we'll be fine.  And there is free parking right on the island.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've only been 3 times last summer but Beau loved it every time.  I even contacted the authorities a few weeks ago to confirm it's still dog friendly and off-leash etc. So... let's hope for a nice day and spend an hour or two with our dogs in the water and around the tiny island on it's short path/trail that runs around it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically GPS the location and follow that like a drone but if you're familiar with Portsmouth it's near Prescott Park...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seacoastnh.com/Travel/Scenic_Walks/Peirce_Island/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.seacoastnh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/peirce-island-portsmouth" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Portsmouth&amp;amp;state=NH&amp;amp;address=2+Pierce+Island+Road&amp;amp;zipcode=03801" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the water and dogs across from the parking area.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274526736000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274189971000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Peirce Island - Portsmouth </name><id>13518339</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274455800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/13518339/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/e/global_15129342.jpeg</photo_url></item>
