The original concept and business plan was to create a setting where fine cigars could be purchased and enjoyed in a comfortable environment. While attending Boston University (and enjoying many cigars), Brandon felt that the city of Boston was a perfect venue for creating this relaxed elegant environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original location of Cigar Masters was on Newbury Street. At first, only coffee and non-alcoholic beverages were served, but within 6 months a beer and wine license was obtained. Soon after, Cigar Masters began receiving many accolades including: Bostonâ€™s Best, Top 10 in the Country by Cigar Aficionado and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you'll join us out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245719094000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243613663000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our First Cigar and Scotch or Brandy or Port Night</name><id>10523043</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245546000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10523043/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/global_6726124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
