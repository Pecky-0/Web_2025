<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello, Java Meetup members!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month we want to gather in a social setting and have two questions on the agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The main topic will be &amp;quot;What experience have you made with profiling?&amp;quot; Which tools did you use? What results did you get? What changes did they prompt in your design/implementation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The second topic is &amp;quot;Who are you interested in as speakers (speaking topics)?&amp;quot;. Please bring ideas to the forefront and I'd appreciate if you'd go through your Rolodex and bring any contact information you might have of people that could aide in the search for interesting presentations. I'm looking for help to find interesting speakers and am willing to do the ground work of asking and organizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward seeing everybody there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marina &amp;amp; Kaj&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaj Kandler</member_name><member_id>1142521</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273539905000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Java Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-java</urlname><id>87071</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Java Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1127174678000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Java October Meetup</name><id>4768149</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1129590000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-java/events/4768149/</event_url></item>
