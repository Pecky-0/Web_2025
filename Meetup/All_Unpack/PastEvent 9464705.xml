If you want to meet up with her at the show you can email her via her profile. She also posted on the message board with more details - &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/messages/boards/thread/6049638"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Side Note***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for the lack of events lately. I haven't been venturing to many shows lately but hope to make it out to some good ones in 2009. If any of you would like become an Assistant Organizer and create your own events, let me know. I'm also looking for a few people to get together and help plan events in person, perhaps we can get this group really off the ground. Hope to hear from you soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Email Amber to find out how to meet-up</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Moeri</member_name><member_id>4913745</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235858393000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231298794000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reel Big Fish - Palladium</name><id>9464705</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232841600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/9464705/</event_url></item>
