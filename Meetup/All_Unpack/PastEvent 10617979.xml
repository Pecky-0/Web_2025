The Ambiance: Casual, Family Friendly cafeteria style dining.  Order at the counter, pay the cashier (Mastercard or cash) and eat!  I have heard wonderful things about the food! And there is plenty of parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  6:30PM IS WHEN I'LL BE THERE, BUT DINERS CAN ARRIVE ANYTIME BETWEEN 6:30 AND 7:00PM.&lt;br /&gt;           BRING YOUR OWN WINE, BEER, ETC. - THEY DO NOT SERVE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES.  THEY CLOSE &lt;br /&gt;           AT 8:00PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review is at   &lt;a href="http://local.yahoo.com/info-10497795-dorothy-leroy-s-southern-cuisine-bloomfield" target="_blank"&gt;http://local.yahoo.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the reservation for 16 people, but more can come if they want to.  So if this looks full, just put your name on the &amp;quot;Wait List&amp;quot; and come anyway - you should be able to get a table next to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get some Southern chow, y'all.  As always I will be collecting $1.00 per member to defray the Meetup costs. - Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation under "Meetup/Betsy"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy</member_name><member_id>3384225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248393549000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244599628000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dorothy &amp; Leroy's 06/17/09 6:30pm</name><id>10617979</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245277800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/10617979/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
