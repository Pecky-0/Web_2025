Our energy will soar! We will live our dream this one special night. All accomplishments start with a dream. I dare you to dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s do something fun. This dance party will have a Tropical Theme. Imagine all of us at the Caribbean. We’re 30 feet from the warm blue waters. There is a hot sultry breeze and you are holding the love of your life in your arms. Your passionate, throbbing bodies beating against each other.  Do you feel the passion? There is not a molecule of oxygen between you and your partner. You feel a oneness between you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All our problems have been dissolved, we don’t sweat the small stuff for the moment because of the intoxication of the drug hormone we are secreting naturally within our bodies,  oxytocin. It flows uncontrollably, wanting , desiring to be with each other. Do you feel it? The embrace, the  laughter, the joy, the carefree spirit of being in love. The feeling of having total trust in someone. Believing in them and sharing each other’s deepest feelings and thoughts.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing matters except gazing into each other’s eyes with the expectation of embracing the entire night and into the morning, being one. Do you see it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is she wearing, what are you wearing? The colored blouse, white shorts, white slacks, colored flowered shirt. Do you see it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear it July 31st. Look like you would be dressed on this Caribbean island with the love of your life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this happen for everyone? Yes, because  there is someone out there that is our perfect match. When they see you or me they will say you’re perfect. Your gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Women, when a man  sees you, he will stumble on his words or forget what to say because you have dazzled him.  Have patience they will recover and make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must learn how to do within whenever are doing without, Imagine the person, where are you with them, it might not be the Caribbean, it may be Cape Cod. It may be going to a movie, out to dinner, walking in the park, meeting at Starbucks or having a new friend visit you at home. See it, feel it, and we will achieve it. Do within when you’re doing without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Values of this group:  To be nice, kind, cheerful, friendly and to be respectful to everyone.  We utilize private dance parties as a vehicle to meet other singles.  Purpose is to socialize with similar people of our age (30-65) who are searching for a lifetime partner.  Have fun meeting old and new friends.  Circulate, talk to everyone.  If someone is alone go up to them and say hi!  Please be Friendly, Positive, and optimistic to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Yes Dance - I ask you to be respectful and say yes to anyone who asks you to dance once.  Please understand this is our number one value.  If you are able to say yes, then this is a great event for you to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invite other friends, particularly men.  Our objective is to have an equal amount of men and women.  We are very close on equal numbers of men and women.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The synergistic efforts of everyone will make it truly a memorable dance party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The entry fee is $15.00 plus wine or food assignment listed below.
