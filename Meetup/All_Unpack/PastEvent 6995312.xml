Grant collaborated with Dr. John Herman at the sleep research laboratory of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas to access unconcsious visual memory.  The artist used herself as a subject and was digitally monitored while sleeping.  Trained technicians questioned her during rapid eye movement, Rem, sleep.  She used the tapes of those narrative interviews as inspiration for the haunting large-scale images that recreate the fragmented experiences of dreaming.  The shadowed images are stretched and distorted allowing one to enter the illusive world of her unconscious.  For more info go to website www.hmcp.org/exhibitions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hallmark Museum of Contemporary Photography is located in the recently refurbished former Colle Opera House at the heart of Turners Falls renaissance district.  Turners Falls is an artistic area and it always inspires me.  The plan will be to go out for dinner after in the downtown area of Turners Falls.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201637139000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199045798000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Night Journey Art Exhibit</name><id>6995312</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201464000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/6995312/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/f/global_2611791.jpeg</photo_url></item>
