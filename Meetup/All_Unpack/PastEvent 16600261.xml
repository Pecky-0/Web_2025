Scientists  predict that our penchant for eating fish, especially the large ones,  is causing the world&amp;rsquo;s supplies of fish to dwindle at a rate that will  leave us with no fish in our oceans by about 2048. The balance of the  eco-systems of the waters of the world have lost their balance as we  have fished many species into near-extinction. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;The message is  straightforward and sobering. But these scientists and activists are  hopeful and give us some suggestions about what we can do to bring more  consciousness to what we are eating. This documentary is disturbing and  inspirational. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Our February Conscious Movie supports Greenpeace  and their efforts to educate people and reverse the impact of  overfishing in our oceans. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you!  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;These  events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a  deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our  perceptions.  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people and support a worthy cause! &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298862105000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297956518000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup for February - End of the Line</name><id>16600261</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298764800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/16600261/</event_url></item>
