South Shore people can either car pool to the Red Line together or drive in. For those who live near the Green Line, you can transfer at Park Street Station to the Red Line heading towards Alewife and get off at Davis Square. On Sundays you don't need to put money in the parking meters. The atmosphere at Johnny D's Brunch is usually casual and relaxed. You can each order whatever you want off of the menu. There are vegetarian options.
