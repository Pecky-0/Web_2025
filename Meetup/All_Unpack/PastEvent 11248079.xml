The story: Facing freezing and starvation, we join three Homo neanderthalensis tribesmen as they set out on their quest to steal more fire from a natural blaze or other primitive human beings. But what they are about to discover is the power that will eventually open the door for another species, Homo sapiens, to explore the farthest regions of the Universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Quest For Fire&amp;quot; is the first of several free classic Sci-Fi Movie screenings to be held at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The showings are held in the Phillips Auditorium of the Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, about one mile west of Harvard Square. No reservations are necessary; however, seating is to the capacity of the auditorium (120) . Entrance to the auditorium is at the west of the Center complex, near the Madison Street entrance and large parking lot. The Center also can be easily reached by public transportation. From the Harvard MBTA Station (Red Line), take any bus or trackless trolley going west on Concord Avenue (Arlmont Village and Belmont Center buses, Huron Avenue trolleys) and get off at &amp;quot;Observatory Hill.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on turnout, we might head into Harvard Square for a bite to eat afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full details here: &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/movie_night.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Info: &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082484/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be out front with a meetup sign until 6:30 PM (after that, you're on your own!)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom "spot" Callaway</member_name><member_id>2590946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254870443000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251740824000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SciFi Movie Outing: Quest For Fire</name><id>11248079</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253831400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/11248079/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
