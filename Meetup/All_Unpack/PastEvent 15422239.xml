Each rider gets a list of  items that must be purchased, each from a different store. You just can't get two from the same place. First one back wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the race, when everything is tallied and totaled, all of the food purchased goes to the local Food Bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no entry fee -- you'll just pay for what you buy (15-20 bucks). (That's what the &amp;quot;fee&amp;quot; shown here represents.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're going to go ride anyway, right? Just pick up some food along the way and help us help a lot of people who don't have the luxury of jumping on a bike 'just for fun.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The race will start at Allspeed Cyclery on Auburn Street, and end at &lt;a href="http://www.projectfeed.me/" target="_blank"&gt;Project F.E.E.D.&lt;/a&gt;, our featured food bank, which is housed at Woodfords Congegregational Church on Woodford Street. The stores are mostly near or on the peninsula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Participants will receive a map at the start of the race with grocery stores locations &amp;amp; a shopping list (manifest). Riders will go to 5 grocery store checkpoints and buy non-perishable food items from the manifest. There is no registration fee, the $20 goes to purchase the items. All collected goods will be donated to &lt;a href="http://www.projectfeed.me/" target="_blank"&gt;Project F.E.E.D.&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the race. This is for a great cause and at the same time shines a positive spotlight on the local cycling community. You will be required to keep all receipts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring: &lt;/b&gt; $20 for purchasing items, a bag, and a bike. Locks and helmets are recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The race is about 8 miles, speed is an obvious advantage but knowing your way around the city &amp;amp; the aisles of a supermarket can also help you significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who prefer not to ride really fast it's okay. If speed is not your thing you can ride the event as a scavenger hunt instead of a race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't race? Too Cold?  Stop by and drop of some canned goods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A history of Cranksgiving can be found &lt;a href="http://www.cranksgiving.net/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dylan</member_name><member_id>12017541</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291497064000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289529200000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cranksgiving Portland 2010</name><id>15422239</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290265200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/15422239/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/d/global_19560621.jpeg</photo_url></item>
