&lt;p&gt;I have looked into flights...and currently (we should decide soon and purchase) the best flights I found are on Jet Blue for around $500-$550 round trip. (only 1 layover in NY, not to crazy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also...for the more experienced surfer that wants to bring their own board - Jet Blue is only $50 each way (check for size limitations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surf package includes saturday-saturday room, airport transfer (normally about $50 Â each way), board rental, a daily surf lesson and/or surf tour for more experienced surfers, and daily breakfast (the food there was great, I was there once a few years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on going towards the end of September or beginning of October, but we should plan on booking over the next week or so because I am sure they are filling up with this great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went here once before and had a really great time. there is a great wave right in front of the hotel, and they even took us to some other beaches a couple days. the lessons are really good, even for intermediate surfers, there is much to learn. the instructors were very good when i was there before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the surf picture in my profile is from there too! they have an in house photographer to take photos of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*** make sure to read through the comments below for updates, and ask any questions you many have ***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have closed RSVP's for now, since we are at the limit of space for the rooms they have available. If people cancel or they get more rooms available we can open it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ad364c ; font-size : large"&gt;***Booking Instructions***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c ; font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Book your flight on jetblue.com for September 29 - October 6.&lt;/strong&gt; You are welcome to choose a different airline, but this is where I found the deal for $458. I added insurance for $40. I highly recommend adding insurance - I used it the last time when my bag was delayed 3 days and I had to purchase clothes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c ; font-size : medium"&gt;there is only one flight saturday-saturday, but just in case...the flight #'s and seats I have are (i chose empty rows, so you can sit near me if you want):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c ; font-size : medium"&gt;Boston-NY flight 1001, seat 14C &lt;br /&gt;

 NY-Liberia flight 1691, seat 15C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c ; font-size : medium"&gt;Liberia-NY flight 1692, seat 16C &lt;br /&gt;

 NY-Boston flight 1018, seat 16B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c ; font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Call Witch's Rock to pay them $595 to reserve your spot (888-318-7873).&lt;/strong&gt; Tell them you are with "Denise Lamb's surf group". Also tell them your surfing ability (beginner, intermediate, advanced) so they can plan accordingly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c ; font-size : medium"&gt;3) After you have booked everything, come back here to meetup and update your RSVP (see mine) to say "booked it" so that I know who has booked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #1f1f3c ; font-size : medium"&gt;We have the rooms being held until Friday. So if you have problems booking before Friday, please let me know by posting on here, or sending me a personal message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>11388242</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349625204000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Surfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>surfing-69</urlname><id>737305</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Surfing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343314350000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>surf camp in costa rica</name><id>74993082</id><headcount>5</headcount><duration>615600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348916400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/surfing-69/events/74993082/</event_url></item>
