There will be no post-film discussion at a restaurant , but we will surely chat for a bit afterwards and everyone will get back home at a reasonable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F.W. Murnau was one of the most eminent of all silent film directors. This German Expressionist is most widely known for his early take on the Dracula myth, &lt;b&gt;Nosferatu&lt;/b&gt;- still darn scary if you ask me. Yet his last film made in Germany was the simple tale of an aging doorman who is  no longer needed, &lt;b&gt;The Last Laugh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunrise&lt;/b&gt;, aka A Song of Two Humans  was made in Hollywood and is perhaps his finest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F.W. Murnau's &lt;b&gt;Sunrise&lt;/b&gt;  conquered time and gravity with a freedom that was startling to its first audiences. To see it today is to be astonished by the boldness of its visual experimentation. Roger Ebert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considered by many to be the finest silent film ever made by a Hollywood studio, F.W. Murnau's &lt;b&gt;Sunrise&lt;/b&gt; represents the art of the wordless cinema at its zenith. This &amp;quot;Song of Two Humans&amp;quot; takes place in a colorful farming community, where people from the city regularly take their weekend holidays. Local farmer George O'Brien, happily married to Janet Gaynor, falls under the seductive spell of Margaret Livingston, a temptress from The City. He callously ignores his wife and child and strips his farm of its wealth on behalf of Livingston, but even this fails to satisfy her. One foggy evening, O'Brien meets Livingston at their usual swampland trysting place. She bewitches him with stories about the city â€” its jazz, its bright lights, its erotic excitement. Thrilled at the prospect of running off with Livingston, O'Brien stops short: &amp;quot;What about my wife?&amp;quot;  All Movie Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murnau's visual mastery, his marriage of expressionism, visual lyricism and the daring technological ambition of pre-sound Hollywood, shows silent cinema at its pinnacle  Channel 4 Film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know what- its free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tom will be holding a bright red Meet-up sign in the lobby</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222217727000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Silent Classic- F W Murnau's Sunrise </name><id>8819820</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222900200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8819820/</event_url></item>
