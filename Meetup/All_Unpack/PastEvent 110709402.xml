&lt;p&gt;We'll expand to more games if more than 4 people show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 2-4 player game I still have in shrink wrap, so it's about time I read the directions and play it! If you have experience with it; let me know - I've never played it before, but it looks fun! The back says: "Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four ssacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work togethre and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escapte before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!"&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana</member_name><member_id>5417968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364094978000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364073580000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forbidden Island</name><id>110709402</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364083200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/110709402/</event_url></item>
