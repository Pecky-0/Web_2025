<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The Minuteman Bikeway is a relaxing, comfortable rail trail. It extends from Bedford to Cambridge (Alewife). The Minuteman Bikeway passes through the historic area where the American Revolution began in April 1775. Today, the Minuteman Bikeway is one of the most popular and successful rail-trails in the United States, enjoyed for both healthy recreation and transportation. The bikeway has become a new type of &amp;ldquo;Main Street&amp;rdquo; where neighbors and strangers alike come together while riding, walking, or skating on the path.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**It is open year round. It is level terrain with asphalt pavement, 12' wide. 11 miles one way. I usually start in Bedford and end in Arlington (Arlington Sq.) about 8 mls one way. From here you may extend to Cambridge if you wish or stop in Arlington Sq. to get some lemonade, ice tea, or ice cream after the ride to cool off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**DIRECTIONS: Coming from Interstate 95 (MA-Rte 128), take exit 31B for Routes 4/225 North toward Bedford. At the fourth traffic signal (and CVS store), turn left on Loomis St. Go to end of street to intersection with South Rd. The bikeway is adjacent to the Freight House building. There is parking in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Rain cancels of course. If there is less than 3 people I may still go, if not there will be a cancel note.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim</member_name><member_id>7717713</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1311871454000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Leisure Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-235</urlname><id>527341</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Boston Leisure Bicycling</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311542667000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Minuteman Bikeway, Bedford to Arlington</name><id>26877311</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1311804900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-235/events/26877311/</event_url></item>
