There will be at least 2 nets, one of which will be used for doubles play (regular or reverse co-ed, depending on popular vote). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is for advanced players only. Briefly, if you aren't comfortable with 5-1 or 6-2, if you aren't comfortable hitting or setting 2s, shoots, or the occasional 1, this is probably not the level for you. In order to maintain a quality game, you may be asked to leave if your level of play is not sufficient. If you are not sure of your level, please send an email to one of the organizers by following the links in the Organizer box on the meetup website.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251328292000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250893878000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ADVANCED Outdoor Volleyball Mon 8/24 6pm Sidney &amp; Pacific</name><id>11168423</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251151200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/11168423/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/3/global_1997523.jpeg</photo_url></item>
