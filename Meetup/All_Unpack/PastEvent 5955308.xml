However you're not limited to breakfast food at this 'Jewish style' restaurant. Checkout the menu for all that's offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://zaftigs.com/menus.html" target="_blank"&gt;Zaftig's Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please arrive promptly and bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip and tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://zaftigs.com/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;Directions via MBTA and Car &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMINDER of MEMBER GUIDELINES: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; after the event and you have not attended the event, it is counted as a no-show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members who miss/no-show three meals for which they have RSVP'ed &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;, are removed from the group.
