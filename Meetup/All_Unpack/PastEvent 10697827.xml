From there we walk around Farrar Pond and up Mt Misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Contrary to reservations like Blue Hills or Middlesex Fells, the Mount Misery area in Lincoln is an open, lively place where everyday life continues at the slower pace of the countryside. On these trails, you feel more like visiting some farms away in the north than exercising with fellow urbanites on overused paths. Though close to Boston, Lincoln is therefore a great place to breathe after a hard week and to reconnect with the outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This short hike takes you through woodlands, agricultural fields and meadows to the top of Mt. Misery, a modest hill covered by a dense pine forest. Except for the short climb to the summit, the hike is mostly flat.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>25</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250207996000</updated><rating><average>4.38000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245540828000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Farrar Pond &amp; Verrill Farm, Lincoln</name><id>10697827</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249740000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/10697827/</event_url></item>
