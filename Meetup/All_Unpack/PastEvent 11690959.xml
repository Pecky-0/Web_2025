<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I am hoping the weather allows us to enjoy this hike this weekend.  This trial has some great views and interesting climbs.  When we hit the ridge we should be able to see to Long Island Sound.  This will be a 6 mile loop hike that should take not more than 5 hours.  There is plenty of ups and and a beautiful trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 10:00 AM at the Rte. 77 parking area for the Mattabesett Trail (on rte. 77, 4.6 miles south of Durham or 4.3 miles north of Rte. 80 in Guilford - see location below). This will be both our starting location and our ending location.  We will road walk about 2/3 mile to the start of the loop.  The group will hike on the Lone Pine Trail for 3 miles west to north-west and up onto Totoket Mountain. This is a traprock mountain of altitude 720 ft. We join the Mattabesett and hike 3 miles to the south-east, past Bluff Head and its associated cliffs overlooking Myerhuber Pond and the three preserves in the valley. We reach the endpoint back at the cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that terrain, conditions, and individual party members may affect the overall timing of the hike. I have been conservitive with the estimated times and as long as all parties are reasonable fit, experienced, and equiped we should come in earlier than I estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear hiking boots for this trail.  Also dress in layers and bring water, snack, lunch, a camera......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate/directions (fixed) location of the meetup location, Rte. 77 (Durham Rd.) in Guilford, CT via MapQuest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Guilford&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=4600+Durham+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions, use Google Maps (works for lat/long,  approx.
