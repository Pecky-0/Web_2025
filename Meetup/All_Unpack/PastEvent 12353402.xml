I am excited to announce our next EatUp! which will be on Thursday, February 25th at 6:30 PM at the FABULOUS, much acclaimed restaurant in Agawam called &lt;a href="http://www.thefederalrestaurant.com/files/dinner_menu.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Federal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have heard nothing but rave reviews about this place, even from our members, and we are so excited to try it! Christine made a special trip a few weeks ago here is what she told me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's a regal looking stand-alone federal style residence that's been changed to a restaurant (seats up to 142 total, I believe, so it's pretty large--with a separate bar area, small dining room, back dining room and main dining room).   It reminded me of an upscale place I went in New Orleans (also a converted house).  They have plenty of parking around the place and it's quite easy to get to, although somewhat unexpected in a residential area....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their menu has a definite Americana-Italiano feel, with things like thin crust pizza, veal parmesan and spaghetti pomodoro.  This put me off at first because there are so many mediocre 'Italianesque' places around and some of the dishes at first glance sound so regular.  However, they appear to have their own take on things--like &amp;quot;paper thin&amp;quot; pizza crust--I saw one come out of the kitchen and it looked quite delicate and lovely.  Their &amp;quot;burger and fries&amp;quot; ($12) is described as an &amp;quot;American Kobe Beef Burger with au poivre sauce&amp;quot; served with parmsan fries.  Their most expensive entree appears to be $38, but they have a wide variety to suit a range of budgets.  They also have some truly unique things on the menu like &amp;quot;fig poppers&amp;quot; (gorgonzola-stuffed black mission figs wrapped in prosciutto).  Although I didn't have a full dinner, I tried the poppers and they were outrageously good, so much so that I may have to return weekly for them.  Other interesting-sounding items:  risotto balls with truffle butter, seared scallop hash (atop duck confit, sugar pumpkins, carmelized onions and &amp;quot;melting&amp;quot; truffles).  They also have some wild things on their drink menu, like a spiced orange russian and a pumkin-tini.  I tried their &amp;quot;orchid and champagne&amp;quot; which is champagne mixed with pomegranate, passion fruit or mango liquor.  Quite tasty.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was also quite good (it was pretty empty when I got there, since I went so early).  Another patron asked if I'd been there before and when I said &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; he had only rave reviews about the place.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Christine, for such a thorough review, it brings the place alive for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a review roundup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://local.yahoo.com/info-10000076-federal-agawam" target="_blank"&gt;Yahoo!
