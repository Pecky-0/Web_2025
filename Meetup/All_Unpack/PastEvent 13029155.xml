She will also offer some practical decluttering tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will discuss: &amp;quot;how to bring parts of nature inside into our home so that we feel more connected with the natural world.  This would be ideal as it will be the beginning of spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some examples of this would be:&lt;br /&gt;a collection of shells or interesting things found in nature that we can display;&lt;br /&gt;an arrangement of some budding twigs;&lt;br /&gt;an arrangement of crystals and/or beautiful stones that hold our intentions.&lt;br /&gt;and most importantly how to make room for these beautiful things.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to speak and do a small demonstration for about a half hour and then answer questions for about half hour.&lt;br /&gt;How does that sound to you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maureen is very eager to speak to our group. Hope that many of you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1276200770000</updated><rating><average>4.17000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Accountability Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>declutter-113</urlname><id>963536</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Tools for Decluttering, Personal Change &amp; Goal Attainment</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269897349000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Guest Speaker at Panera Bread</name><id>13029155</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270681200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/declutter-113/events/13029155/</event_url></item>
