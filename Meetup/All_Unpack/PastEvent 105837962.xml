The Scenic Theater is in the process of becoming a non-profit 501c3 company and is looking for volunteers to help out rebuilding the theater.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scenic Theater used to be a "movie theater" about 30 years ago, before this it was performance house hosting live vaudervile shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;The non-profit community group; "Scenic Theater", a 501c3 pending organization was established to preserve and operate the historic Scenic Theater as a financially sustainable cultural center presenting a wide range of theater and arts programs that creates excitement, pride and support within our community. The Scenic Theater will be a destination for community members to enjoy entertainment in the form of regularly scheduled live theater performances for children and adults, digital movies, independent film screenings, live music, dance performances, stage performances, and special guest speaker events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be an information/board meeting at&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #00ccff"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333300"&gt;7 pm at the Governors Inn on March 5th&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scenic Theater is looking for volunteers: who would like to help out, some of the various positions are: &lt;span style="color : #003300"&gt;board members/ officers/ people who have knowledge in plumbing, carpentry,electrical, HVAC, grant writing, theatrical performances, stage lightening, producers and other postions. In the future some of these volunteer positions will lead up to a paid position.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
