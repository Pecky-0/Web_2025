&lt;p&gt;Due to bird nesting season, most of the hike will follow forest roads so Buffett and any of his four-legged friends won't be as likely to disturb ground nesting birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be one convenient spot for those less in interested in a long hike to turn back after about an hour, making it a two-mile hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full hike will pass cranberry bogs, ponds, and frost hollows in the pine barrens, and more.  Wear sturdy shoes or boots, bring water and lunch, and protect yourself from ticks and the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help Buffett and me decide if the route should be offered again or perhaps adapted to a longer version.  Remember the time it takes  will depend on the speed we hike and whether we opt for any side trips or variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
