With the king's Black Knight army, the villagers will have nothing to look forward to on Christmas. But Santa is coming to town with his sleigh full of toy and goodies for the kids and swords and bucklers for all the good towns people that want to overthrow the evil king! Will the South Pole be rid of their tyrannical king, or will everyone be getting a stocking full of coal this Christmas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous swordsmanship experience is not required.  We provide the padded weapons.  This is a family event with adults, teens and kids (ages 6+).  Sweats and T-shirts suggested.  No shorts or tanktops allowed.  Under 18 must have signed waiver by parents.  18 and over must have their own signed waiver.  Waivers can be downloaded here:  &lt;a href="http://www.guardup.net/sword/documents/event_waiver.doc" target="_blank"&gt;Waiver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee:  $10 for Meet Up members (and their friends) who pre-register ($20 for non).  Pre-registration required as these events DO fill up and we cannot take anyone else after our capacity is reached.  To pre-register you must call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead with a credit card or cash.  Make sure to tell them that &amp;quot;Meghan sent you&amp;quot; so that you get the Meet Up rate which is the same as the Member Rate (a savings of $10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  RSVP with YES does NOT PRE-REGISTER.  You MUST call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead to complete the pre-registration process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At-Door is $20 and you may be turned away if there is not enough room.  Since we fill up before the event more than 1/2 the time, pre-registration is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to be ontime for required safety instruction at start of event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Anyone at the Front Desk can help you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meghan</member_name><member_id>5106555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229214619000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228072748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sword Fighters Night: Silent Ninja, Holey Knight</name><id>9251747</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228521600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/9251747/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/6/global_6162838.jpeg</photo_url></item>
