&lt;p&gt;This year's Holiday Market will feature the very best of New England's independent designers, artists and crafters. From the fashionably chic to the hip and cutting edge, shoppers are sure to find an original gift for everyone on their list. Expect to find an exceptional array of indie goods, including: handbags, jewelry, pottery, letterpress stationery, silk-screened t-shirts, baby clothes, re-purposed wool accessories and more! This handmade holiday spectacular will be held in the spacious and historic main building of the Benjamin Franklin Institute, located in the heart of Boston's South End. Within walking distance to Boston's best galleries, boutiques and international cuisine, the SoWa Holiday Market is at the center of Boston's most diverse and exciting neighborhoods!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kha </member_name><member_id>18203941</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355158255000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1354556020000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch and SOWA Holiday Market</name><id>93877702</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355067900000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/93877702/</event_url></item>
