The second game is against Switzerland and we can watch the game with sound on at the Tavern in the Square.  For this event I need an ACCURATE headcount so I can tell the bar how many people to expect. They have a private room that has a separate TV, so it should be perfect for your group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you RSVP so we know how many people will be joining us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the restaurant/bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew</member_name><member_id>2881088</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266710974000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263605819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Expat Canadian February Meetup</name><id>lqqfyndbxb</id><headcount>34</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266537600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/12332835/</event_url></item>
