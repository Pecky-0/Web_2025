I would like to keep getting in some more jogging while we still can during the week and love the track since everyone can go at their own pace.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sunset is 6:16, so it may be dark by the time we leave the track.  We not have any lights on at the track either so it could be pretty dark by the time we leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, October 7th&lt;br /&gt;6:00 pm &lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School &lt;br /&gt;Track &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fee: Annual Members - FREE, Members and Guests - $2 per person &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer(s): Julie &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attendance is unlimited. &lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by 4pm on Wednesday, October 7th.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel. We will train if it is overcast or there is a slight drizzle. Please plan to bring a lightweight jacket with a hood just in case.
