Depending on responses, I might try and grab tickets tomorrow. If there's not a lot of us, we'll just get them at the door Saturday. Show starts at 8:00pm and runs approx. 1 hour. Tickets are $29.&lt;br /&gt;After the show, we can grab food/drinks at Leon's, nearby at 500 Long Wharf Drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.longwharf.org/summer09starWars.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.longwharf....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Man Star Wars Trilogy Fri 07/24/09 To Sun 07/26/09 &lt;br /&gt;Written and performed by Charles Ross&lt;br /&gt;Mainstage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A wild amusement park ride … my first impulse was to get in line and go again.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;-Chicago Herald&lt;br /&gt;“A one man reenactment of Star Wars is nerdier – and funnier – than you could possibly imagine.”&lt;br /&gt;-Spin Magazine &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   Back  Add to basket &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A one hour, high energy, non-stop blast through the original three Star Wars films: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The catch is, there is only one cast member. Charles Ross, the writer and solo performer got the idea for the show from spending his childhood in a galaxy far, far away. Watch and laugh as Ross plays all of the characters, recreates the effects, sings the music, flies the ships and fights both sides of the battles.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Im bald.
