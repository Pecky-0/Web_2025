<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Reiki is special in both a spiritual and physical way. It is something that a lot of people have expressed interest in but have never had the opportunity to learn about. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This will be our opportunity to learn the basic principles of Reiki and then practice it. Our instructor Julia is a passionate practitioner and teacher with years of experience. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will be meeting at a very comfortable location in Dedham. The address will be given to people who have a serious Yes RSVP a couple of days before. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Donations are voluntary. We will be giving Julia about $100. If you can donate $10 then it will make our costs lower. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Feel free to bring snacks. There will be a couch, chairs and room to lie comfortably on the floor. This will be an interesting, educational, relaxing and exciting event!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325994901000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325188076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn and Practice Reiki!</name><id>45871232</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325894400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/45871232/</event_url></item>
