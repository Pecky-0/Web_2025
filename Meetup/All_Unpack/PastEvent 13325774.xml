This will be a short, moderate hike to start the trip with a late start time to allow travel up to NH. We'll meet at the trail head at 1:45 and start the hike at 2. We'll take the Frankenstein Cliff Trail to the Arethusa Falls Trail and finish on the Bemis Brook Trail....total hike is 4.7 miles with a 1500 foot elevation gain. The first part going up the cliff is strenuous but after that its a pretty easy hike....and the 200 foot falls are beautiful. Total hike is about 3 hours, plus we'll probably spend some extra time at the falls. LOCATION: The trail head is located on route 302 at the southern end of Crawford Notch State Park. It is near Dry River Campground. North of Bartlett and south of the AMC Highland Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking groups are limited to 10 people in the White Mountains....but we have more than 10 interested so I'll open it to 20 and we can divide into two groups at the trail head. Let me just remind people that although this hike is moderate, its still a 1500 ft elevation gain....to put it in context, Monadnock is an 1800 ft elevation gain, so its only a little less! Keep that in mind when signing up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND TRIP:&lt;br /&gt;We have events in the White Mountains on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. An easy hike on Saturday at Frankenstein Cliffs and Arethusa Falls, a challenging one on Sunday as we summit Mts Pierce and Jackson, and a fun day zip lining on Monday. Feel free to join us for any of the events or all three. There are plenty of places to stay nearby. I rented a cabin for myself for 65 dollars a night here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abetterlifenh.com/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abetterlifenh.com/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.abetterlif...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also a couple of campgrounds nearby that are about 30 bucks a night (assuming 2 adults per campground, 10 bucks for additional adults up to 4 total)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beechhill.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beechhill.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.beechhill....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crawfordnotchcamping.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crawfordnotchcamping.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.crawfordno...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the AMC highland center is nearby, I think its 90 bucks a night:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/whitemountains/highland/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/whitemountains/highland/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.outdoors.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These locations are all near the two hikes, the zip lining is in Lincoln, about 40 minutes from area where the hikes are.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the bright yellow escape or call my cell 508 414 8544.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275434698000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272507696000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Memorial Day Weekend Trip: Frankenstein Cliffs and Arethusa Falls</name><id>13325774</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275155100000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/13325774/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/0/global_14701488.jpeg</photo_url></item>
