I still love baseball, and I still love my GIANTS!! I'm VERY excited that they've made it AND that this next game isn't going to end at 1:00am east coast time. GAME 3 -- SF Giants @ Reds is TOMORROW at 5:30pm.  Greg, the wonderful manager at Battery Park, has agreed to put on SOUND for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be there in my Giants gear with my Lou Seal mascot. So, if you feel like watching some baseball, come on down!  Reds fans need not apply.  Juuuuust kidding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://batteryparkboston.com"&gt;Battery Park&lt;/a&gt; is conveniently located in the Financial District of Boston, close to all subway lines. Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink.  SO PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GO GIANTS!! - Isabel&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the LOU SEAL mascot!
