Let's reconnoiter at West Rock for a healthy, brief walk in the company of friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at West Rock, which is a Connecticut State Park located in New Haven and Hamden.  There are various entrances to the park, but we will be parking at Lake Wintergreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN:  West Rock offers various levels of hiking, as it is a very large park.  However, this Meetup will be manageable for any hiker, and will offer a scenic view of the bethany area, and a chance to walk by the lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the Lake Wintergreen entrance, which is located on Main Street, between 12:45 and 1:00, and we'll get rolling onto the trail by five minutes after one. This walk will take less than 2 hours.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING:  A bottle of WATER! and a snack if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads;  &lt;b&gt;layers&lt;/b&gt; of clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST:  We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website.  Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please see Google map below.  When you reach the intersection of Wintergreen and Main, you will see a sign for Lake Wintergreen (you can pretty much see the Lake Wintergreen parking area from there - it is just at the bottom of the hill).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is no fee for parking in the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325276" target="_blank"&gt;Park website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Wintergreen+Ave+%26+Main+St,+CT+06514&amp;amp;sll=41.313428,-72.916724&amp;amp;sspn=0.007962,0.019312&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.35998,-72.962222&amp;amp;spn=0.007956,0.019312&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;g=Wintergreen+Ave+%26+Main+St,+CT+06514&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;iwstate1=saveplace" target="_blank"&gt;Google Map - Approximate Location of Park Entrance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer (Sarah) will be wearing red</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254679291000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251308953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Hikers'  Sunday Afternoon Walk at West Rock (Lake Wintergreen)</name><id>11207115</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253466000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/11207115/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/f/global_5551711.jpeg</photo_url></item>
