&lt;p&gt;The Hokke Senbo service is a Buddhist reflection service, it is also known as Buddhist repentence. This practice is discussed in the Threefold Lotus Sutra. &lt;em&gt;The Dharma Practice of Universal Sage Bodhisattva&lt;/em&gt; is the third sutra in the threefold. It is here were the Buddha speaks about the practices of Universal Sage (Fugen Bodhisattva). The practice is of Sange (repentence) or I feel better said as reflection. During the service we reflect on our past actions and deeds and think about the suffering we have created. Through this action we grow as Bodhisattvas and learn from our past deeds. We practice this service on a regular schedule at this Temple. This service takes up to two hours to complete as a large portion of the Lotus Sutra is chanted in English during the service. Almost all of the service is in English. It does contian singing praise with prostrations and circumabulation. If you have not done this service before it may be a little difficult at first. Everyone is always welcome to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
