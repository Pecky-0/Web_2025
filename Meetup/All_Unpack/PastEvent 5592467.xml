<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The first meeting will be an organizational meeting where we discuss the BosWebCMS group charter, gather objectives, and establish a schedule for presentations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come and discuss what you want to accomplish in this group, the topics you want to see covered, and the order in which you want them covered.  There are as many CMS applications as organizations and people implementing them, many technologies involved, and many ways to implement them.  Please come to this meeting to have your voice heard and help advance the mission of the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also discuss possible support mechanisms for the group to do interesting things &amp;quot;away from meetings&amp;quot;, i.e., using portal/CMS/Community Systems to support the group itself.  I am sure there will be no shortage of ideas on ways to do this, or opinions on which system(s) to use !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared....this group will be a lot of fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>RichKin</member_name><member_id>3557763</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177111280000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>People interested in CMS</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newengland-webcms</urlname><id>422397</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Web Content Management Systems Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174523153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston WebCMS Organizational Meeting</name><id>5592467</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176938100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newengland-webcms/events/5592467/</event_url></item>
