The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ” &lt;br /&gt;Irene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ This was a fun time. Alan's leadership style is loose, offering suggestions and some instruction. Nice group of people, too.”&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ It is the best drumming circle in the area! People really come together in a community, and with a community spirit. Instruments are provided if you don't have one. ... ”&lt;br /&gt;A former member&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Alan, it was an amazing experience being a part of the drum circle on Friday.
