&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Teas and Javas - in Wayland Square on the East Side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you're worried I've finally fallen off my rocker, I assure you this isn't the case! It's true that Teas and Javas is Wayland Square's newest coffee house location, BUT did you know they were open until 11pm every night AND besides a stylishly modern decor that boasts huge glass doors that open onto awning-covered sidewalk tables, they offer a good selection of beer, wine, and other adult beverages as well as sandwiches, wraps, and pastries to make your mouth water. Oh, and did I mention, they have &lt;strong&gt;$1 scoop gelato&lt;/strong&gt;!!!!! So, if you haven't been yet, you may want to know about it and even if you have, who knew they had beer, wine and other coffee-based adult beverages plus $1 gelato!? So, let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
