Any type of bike is ok. We'll be on a Tandem that has just had some upgrades done and needs a test ride. We'll stop along route to enjoy the sites. The forecast is for chilly weather so dress warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;The Minuteman Bikeway passes through the historic area where the American Revolution began in April 1775.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the Minuteman Bikeway is one of the most popular and successful rail-trails in the United States, enjoyed for both healthy recreation and transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikeway has become a new type of “Main Street” where neighbors and strangers alike come together while riding, walking, or skating on the path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2008, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy inducted the Minuteman Bikeway into the national Rail-Trail Hall of Fame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the link below for information about the Minuteman Bike Path&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.minutemanbikeway.org/Pages/intro.html" target="_blank"&gt;Minuteman Bikeway Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.minutemanbikeway.org/Media/MinutemanBikewayBrochure2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Detailed Map of Minuteman Bikeway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Bedford end of the Bikeway at the intersection of Loomis Street &amp;amp; South Rd. in Bedford MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Neil Sheehan</member_name><member_id>7739813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290885837000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Snow &amp; Outdoor Sport Enthusisats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastOutdoorSports</urlname><id>1298081</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Snow &amp; Outdoor Sports</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290604386000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biking the Minuteman Bike Trail from Bedford Ma.</name><id>15545909</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290880800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastOutdoorSports/events/15545909/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/8/global_19851352.jpeg</photo_url></item>
