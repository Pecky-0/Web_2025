<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry for this going out late. I created a Facebook event for this a while ago and thought that I had done it here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need people to show support for charter SeaL member Honey Puterbaugh tomorrow's primary election by holding signs at the polling places. The towns are Barrington, Farmington, Strafford, Milton, Middleton, and New Durham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can help out, please contact me (Todd) via meetup email or the campaign email Honey4Rep@HoneyPuterbaugh.com, and I will let you know which town needs coverage and get a sign to you. We are mainly looking for people for the morning (8-10) or evening (5-7) prime time hours, but any time is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please contact me (Todd) via meetup email or the campaign email Honey4Rep@HoneyPuterbaugh.com</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Todd Puterbaugh</member_name><member_id>4083337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307452511000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307381089000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hold Signs At Tomorrow's Primary for Honey Puterbaugh</name><id>21177851</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307448000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/21177851/</event_url></item>
