Tuesday, July 14 is Bastille Day.  What better place to celebrate than at a sleek French wine bar in Boston with a sampling of sauvignon blanc wines!  One of my personal favorites.  Join me for a fun evening on the town in a cool place enjoying fine wine and food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wine tastings are Tuesday nights at 7 pm. Four or five wines are offered along with food. The cost is $30 per person, tax &amp;amp; tip included, unless otherwise indicated below. This Meet-Up must be paid in advance.  Payment must be made by Friday, July 10 or your RSVP will be changed to no.  I will provide payment information as we get closer to the date.  The price will be slightly more ($1-$2) due to the Amazon.com transaction fee.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the wine tasting room</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248299412000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240875473000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sauvignon Blanc Tasting at Les Zygomates - Bastille Day</name><id>10280753</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247612400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/10280753/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/d/global_8384093.jpeg</photo_url></item>
