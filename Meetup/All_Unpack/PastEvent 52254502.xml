It's a level 3 due to it being a long day, and due to a little bit of highway. It's about 300 miles round trip from the Mobil station. Once we're up in Quechee, we'll pick up sandwiches at Subway &amp;amp; bring them to the gorge for a picnic/exploration.  Be sure to wear comfortable footwear.  It will be a long day, returning early to mid evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary H </member_name><member_id>8947310</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348631295000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On Wheels®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329185980000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Queechee Gorge, Vt  (Level 3)</name><id>52254502</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348317000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/52254502/</event_url></item>
