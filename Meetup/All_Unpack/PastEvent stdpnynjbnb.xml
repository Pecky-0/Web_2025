<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Every Thursday night for the summer Bob Barnes (yes, the guy that did the ski training in the fall) will run evening bikes rides starting at the Hopkinton Common. Bob is a former pro-rider for Cannondale. In May most rides will be about 20 miles, the plan is to increase the mileage throughout the summer. Road bikes only! pace will be too fast for mountain bikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find Bob just look for the guy with the bike at the Hopkington Common Gazebo. Please be on-time, bring water, proper clothing and be ready for a good workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob does not check Meetup often so I have posted for him, I will not be able to make it most weeks. I can pass messages on to Bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Common is easy to find - just take Main Street (rt 135) from exit 21a of rt 495.  The common starts at the corner of Hayden Rowe Street.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Bob will have his bike in Gazebo in the center of the common</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276211322000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273615488000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Road Bike Training</name><id>stdpnynjbnb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276207200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak/events/13453829/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/2/global_14838930.jpeg</photo_url></item>
