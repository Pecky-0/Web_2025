<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>DUE TO THE FACT THAT MICHELLE SCHEDULED THIS MEETUP WITH NO SENSITIVITY TO THE FACT THAT IT'S ST. PATRICK'S DAY, I'VE NOW RENAMED THE EVENT AND ENCOURAGE THE PRESENTATION OF GREEN DESSERTS, LICQUORED DESSERTS AND DESSERT WINES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New member Dave Fox has offered to host another EDEMG house party--this time the theme being INTERNATIONAL DESSERTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn't like a little sweetness on their Saturday night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a dessert with an international or ethnic flair. Anything from flan to baklava to Jewish honey cake will be happily accepted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is also BYOB. Non-alcoholic beverages will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave has no pets. But he does have a pool table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you RSVP yes, I will mail you Dave's address in West Hartford and directions a couple of days before the event (so that it is not out on the site available to everyone). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Dave!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174349336000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170796085000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>St. Patricks Day Int'l Dessert Party in West Hartford</name><id>5458460</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174176000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/5458460/</event_url></item>
