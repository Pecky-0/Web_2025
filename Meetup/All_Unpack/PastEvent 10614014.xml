They played at the Harpoon Summer Session and were smokin'  So let's meetup at the Cantab Lounge in Central Square, Cambridge on Thursday, July 2 and kick off the weekend early with a funky groove! Especially since many of us will have Friday the 3rd off from work. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover charge is $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per my usual practice I will email my cell number to all Yes and Maybe RSVPs sometime the day of the event, likely by mid-day, so in case you can't find us, you won't get lost in the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge being what it is, parking is limited, but there are spaces on the street, and a few small lots around.&lt;br /&gt;Better yet, if you take the T, the Central Square Red Line stop is just a block away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get down, get funky!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247616532000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244573451000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chicken Slacks at the Cantab</name><id>10614014</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246582800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/10614014/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/6/global_7100966.jpeg</photo_url></item>
