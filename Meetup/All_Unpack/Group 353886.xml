Mike Hendrickson and I started the Great Model Shoots and running other meet up events and realized that we needed a base of operations. I now own one of the largest photo studios in New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worcester Photo Studios is a 10,000 sq foot studio which was originally an industrial building. We reclaimed it and built it up over the past year. We now have a steel plated room, models changing room, bay doors for cars or other large objects, props, lighting, backdrops, dark room, product shooting rooms, classroom, 35 ft movie screen for movie nights. We've also been continuing to hold some of the largest photo shoots in New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've recently signed a contract with Google to work on their business photos program so that keeps us pretty busy. But now that we have a base of operations and lots of employees we are ready to start ramping up our meet up with some exciting new events. So stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
