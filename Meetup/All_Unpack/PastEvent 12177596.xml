<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&amp;quot;...all is quiet, on New Year's Day...&amp;quot; - Let's make that not so true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so a bunch of you will have attended the Nerd Ball and stayed up late.  And then you won't have to work on Friday and won't know what to do with yourself.  And because I'm the ultimate in lazy, I don't even want to go anywhere, I'll just have people over to my house to have some snacks and play Wii.  Show up when you're conscious.  I don't know how late this will go, late afternoon, early evening.  At some point, I'll kick you out.  Maybe bring some cash in case we decide to order pizza later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll make some cinnamon scones and we can play Rayman Raving Rabbids (super silly mini-games - I have all of them) and maybe a little Rock Band (as long as my landlord is away).  If someone is really daring, you can play Dance Dance Revolution.  People might even decide to play board games, who knows.  I can make tea and cocoa but I don't have a coffeemaker.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How this works:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this Meetup is in my home, you must join the waiting list until I personally approve you to attend. If I know you, you're more likely to get bumped up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Belmont, where there is plenty of street parking and easy access on the 73 bus from Harvard Square. I will send an e-mail to the people on the Yes list with directions to my place after I get up next year (i.e., in the morning before I start making scones).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know:&lt;br /&gt;- I have two young cats (take note if you are allergic)&lt;br /&gt;- I have a few chairs but it's likely some people will be sitting on the floor (where I have a bunch of pillows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you can bring:&lt;br /&gt;- Wiimotes and Nunchuks (I have 2 sets, Rayman TV party can have 4 players)&lt;br /&gt;- Wii Rock Band expansion sets and instruments. I have two microphones, one guitar, and drums.&lt;br /&gt;- Drinks - like juice or a box of coffee, etc.  Or soda (I have a lot of Coke right now, and a variety of other sodas from other Meetups at my house).  &lt;br /&gt;- Snacks - like pastry or fruit or something good for a hangover.  :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1262639919000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262201451000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lazy brunch and video games</name><id>12177596</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262365200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12177596/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/9/global_8529753.jpeg</photo_url></item>
