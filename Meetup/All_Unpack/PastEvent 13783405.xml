Angie has graciously invited the entire chapter to attend.  What better way to get to know a new member?  We met Joseph while bowling last week; what a nice young man!  So, if you're not going on the Gilda Ride, this will be a nice alternative way to spend the day.  Deb &amp;amp; Judi have a great ride planned for along the coast prior to arriving at the party.  &lt;br /&gt;Meet at Walgreen's next to Bickfords at 9:30.  The Group will leave at 10 am.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary H </member_name><member_id>8947310</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277037225000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276394609000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coastal Ride &amp; Party at Angie's</name><id>13783405</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276954200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/13783405/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/b/global_9177195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
