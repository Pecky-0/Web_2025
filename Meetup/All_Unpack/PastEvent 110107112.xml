&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence. Though an unexpected occurrence just a few weeks ago, we're going to try again, so this week's location is: &lt;strong&gt;The Abbey&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering where's Elsbeth? What have you done with her? Well I've given her a break so I'm in charge. I may not be as charming and beautiful, but hey, you get what you get, and everyone knows me for being a boat full of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of love, you better come with a love of burgers. If you haven't read the Yelp reviews (&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-abbey-providence"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-abbey-providence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) this place rocks for its awesome selection of beers and food. Don't like meat? No worries, the salads here are also phenomenon should you side to the veggie. Lots of sides to choose from too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't roll your eyes that this is on the West side. West side is better than the east side, comon', admit it. So come out, get cozy, but not with me, and give MNM a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome, blah blah blah blah ... Nothing ever cancels Monday Night MeetUp. Ever. Except Hurricane Sandy and NYE 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;/p&gt;
