&lt;p&gt;Yikes, last quarter of 2012. How are you doing, attracting what you want? Hopefully, going well. If still distracted &amp;amp; unfocused, perhaps it’s because deep down, you’re still not clear what you want to attract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to Manifesting what you desire is to see yourself as already there - seeing, feeling, &amp;amp; having that desired Outcome. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 So, if unclear, what if you’re able to ask some key questions that would ensure more clarity of the outcome you desire? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Tom Maloney, BostonLOA member &amp;amp; Essential Mind Power Trainer,&lt;/strong&gt; will share how we can use an NLP**-based questionnaire powerfully to springboard us to develop a more well formed outcome. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 A &lt;strong&gt;Well Formed Outcome&lt;/strong&gt; allows you to ... &lt;br /&gt;

 - align your core beliefs with your true desires &lt;br /&gt;

 - know your own value &amp;amp; what you really care about &lt;br /&gt;

 - have a strong sense of motivation &amp;amp; purpose &lt;br /&gt;

 - create a solid plan for success &amp;amp; &lt;br /&gt;

 - propels inspired action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us, make the decision to wrap up the year in a BIG way, modeling the way many successful people think &amp;amp; manifest their outcomes. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;About NLP** &amp;amp; LoA:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 NLP (NeuroLinguistic Programming) is the science of studying success, &amp;amp; then "reprogramming" the software of your mind to produce immediate &amp;amp; positive change in all areas of your life. Combining the thinking of LOA (Law Of Attraction) with NLP skills offers you powerful &amp;amp; practical tools for changing limiting beliefs, behaviors, &amp;amp; for achieving rapid results in your personal, professional &amp;amp; spiritual development&lt;/p&gt;
