Saturday brunch items, however, are quite affordable. They offer salads ($10), sandwiches ($11-19) and typical brunch items such as French toast, Belgian waffles and eggs benedict ($10-19). They also have a lovely outdoor patio overlooking the harbor. If the weather cooperates, we'll eat out there. Otherwise, we'll be in the impressive dining room. Meet us at the bar for greetings if you get there before 1:00. If you're going down Hanover Street, the hotel complex is diagonally to the right at the bottom of the street, right off Commercial St. It would be best to bring cash as we won't get separate checks. Please Note: RSVP's are only being accepted for this event on Thursday 7/8, Friday 7/9 and up to 10:00 AM on Saturday 7/10. But there is no attendance limit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further event guidelines. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the bar until 1:00.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279061413000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278096367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sensing at the Fairmont Battery Wharf-Brunch</name><id>13984895</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278781200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/13984895/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/a/global_7834474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
