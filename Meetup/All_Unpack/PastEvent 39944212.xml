Did you dream of creating your very own unique project and then wearing it? Come have fun with us and learn this quiet and meditative skill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet for 3 Sundays to start and then possibly continue as we keep working on our projects. During our 90 minute classes, we will learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Knit and purl stitches and simple patterns using them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Different ways of reducing and adding stitches and effects they have on patterns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- How to read patterns and create your own simple ones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also pick a project to work on and start it. I suggest working on a scarf if you've never knitted before. Baby blankets are also simple and make great gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the class price is a ball of a gorgeous yarn from Green Mountain Spinnery. Pick one from &lt;a href="http://www.spinnery.com/shop/categories.php?cat=18"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I'll have it for you for the second class when you'll actually need it. Needles for this project are also included. A simpler yarn and needles for practice will be provided during classes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This class is definitely on, sorry for the late notice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please check Directions page at www.eternal-balance.com if you have not been to the studio before.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Olga </member_name><member_id>10158912</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320610245000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members with unlimited potential</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Holistic-Lifestyle-Womens-Club</urlname><id>1467921</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Holistic Lifestyle  Women's Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320421142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn to Knit!</name><id>39944212</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320606000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Holistic-Lifestyle-Womens-Club/events/39944212/</event_url></item>
