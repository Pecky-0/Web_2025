This will give us an opportunity to introduce ourselves and meet before the discussion. We can meet near the bandstand. I'll be there about 4:30pm, feel free to come early and chat before we cross the street and head into the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more about how you can grow the most nutritious, tasty greens in your own backyard. Sue Ventura of Dragonflly Farms, a regular Westford Farmers Market vendor, will give you tips on how to plant your best season's crops organically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be there wearing an orange bandanna. My name is Casey.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241273700000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Co-Creative Planetary Stewards</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Back-to-Basics</urlname><id>1438479</id><group_lat>43.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6200027466</group_lon><name>Back to Basics: Sustainable Self-Sufficient Healthy Living</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240253461000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Organic Farming/Gardening Discussion </name><id>10227276</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240779600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Back-to-Basics/events/10227276/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/e/3/global_8253811.jpeg</photo_url></item>
