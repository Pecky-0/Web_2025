As the artist Max Baumann assembles his memories into a spectacular collage, he reveals the story of four friends and lovers trying to make their way through a world in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge has gotten better and better, and I ended up getting season tickets because everything they are doing this year looks fantastic. PLEASE NOTE: I already have my ticket, since I have season tickets, so we won't be able to sit together as a group (unless you decide to buy tickets together), I just wanted to see if people wanted to join me. There is no group rate. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUYING YOUR OWN TICKET IN ADVANCE, RSVP-ing here does not guarantee attendance! Tickets are on sale starting 11/2. On the day of the show, I will be in the lobby by 1:30 pm. Showtime is 2 pm. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture and plan to be in the lobby at least half an hour early.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anna</member_name><member_id>404606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292156507000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288195936000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Blue Flower at A.R.T. in Harvard Square</name><id>15247419</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292092200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/15247419/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/3/global_19117731.jpeg</photo_url></item>
