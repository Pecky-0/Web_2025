Please feel free to come with your significant other there is a great park and playground nearby for children. Excellent opportunity for less active members to meet with everybody else in the group. Looking forward to having fun. Please bring some salads, chips and drinks (burgers and hot dogs will be provided).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: June 12th 2010, Saturday 3pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Andras’ place in Arlington, details will be e-mailed. It is a 12 minute bus ride or 3 minute drive from Alewife station. (I, Andras, volunteer to pick up and drop off at least one group of people, other pick ups and drop offs certainly can be arranged with members who drive. Please let me know if you need help, and offers from people who will drive anyways are appreciated.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276463021000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274146072000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Philosophy Meetup Group Cook Out</name><id>13514648</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276369200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/13514648/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/5/8/global_13192184.jpeg</photo_url></item>
