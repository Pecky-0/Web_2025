An early notice this time, so early that a few of you will likely intend to come, then forget about it by the time that next Monday rolls around. Hope not, but that's a risk I'll have to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, my wife and I are hosting game night at our home in Concord once again, starting at 7pm and running until people leave. I can always suggest games to play from our library, or you can bring ones of your own – in either case, we'll never be short of fun games to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP if you're in – hope to see you here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267661349000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266897362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>12680777</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267488000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/12680777/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
