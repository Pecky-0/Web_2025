<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of many theme ideas people have thrown out. You may be wondering what it means. Let me explain. The idea of this wild party is to wear anything but actual clothing. This requires a little creativity, ingenuity, and perhaps craftiness. You can fabricate an outfit out of anything such as Household items, kitchen supplies, duct tape, anything your mind can come up with. If anyone has a great idea they've used before write it in the comment section for those less creative among us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brett</member_name><member_id>6413149</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322684423000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319076199000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ABC Theme Party: Anything But Clothes</name><id>38043852</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322352000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/38043852/</event_url></item>
