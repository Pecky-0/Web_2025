There are many schools of thought on the correct alcoholic beverages to accompany different types of Asian food, but it takes a group like ours and a BYOB restaurant to finally resolve this age-old query. Are you up to the challenge? Aiyara Thai Cuisine serves excellent Thai food, is conveniently located in the heart of Harvard Square, and allows diners to bring their choice of libation. Plus, we are headed there a few days AFTER Harvard commencement (so the Square should be blessedly free of students!) Let's discuss what we plan to bring so that we don't have duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but because of no-shows at recent meetings, I'm now requiring members to pay in advance to reserve a spot at our events. In this case, the fees will go toward the tip for our table -- NOT into my pocket. If you end up on the Waiting List, don't worry. . . if and when people who R.S.V.P. before you fail to pay within 24 hours of making their reservation, they will lose their spot and you will get upgraded. Any questions, email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paypal payments should be sent to: purrform@tiac.net&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Iris's table or look for the Meetup sign on the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246309365000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243303884000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"What to drink with Thai food?"
