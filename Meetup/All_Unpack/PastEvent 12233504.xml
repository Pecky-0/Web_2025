It is located on Charles St. in historic Beacon Hill, a five minute walk from the Red Line (Charles St.) and Green Line (Arlington).  They also offer $16 valet parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their website is:     &lt;a href="http://www.lalarokh.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.lalarokh.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;At Lala Rokh on Beacon Hill, the only Eastern Mediterranean restaurant of its kind, we use ingredients, staples of our parent's from native Azerbaijan in northwest Iran, to recreate the home style Persian cuisine we grew up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...it is our goal not just to fill the stomach, but also to arouse the senses. In pursuit of that goal, we combine authentic food, impeccable service, distinctive design, a wine list specifically matched to our cuisine, and an array of artwork unlike any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The home-style Persian cuisine of LaLa Rokh is distinctive, with recipes dating back centuries. The meats, grains, herbs, fruits, vegetables, and spices in these dishes combine to create a sum far greater than its parts. Our food is extremely aromatic and flavorful, yet subtle.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm getting hungry!
