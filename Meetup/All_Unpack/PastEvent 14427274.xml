The show time is 7:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not for everyone, it is going to be a cheesy gory horror film, reminiscent of Jaws but with lots of tiny fish.  Richard Dreyfus is even in it!  When I saw the trailer, I was immediately intrigued.  Love the fact that it will be 3d!  Then a friend requested that I schedule it as a meetup.   Unfortunately, I can't do it during it's opening weekend, but hope that if you were planning to see it that you can wait and see it with the group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a meetup badge. Check out my picture on the meetup site, so you will recognize me. I generally get there about a half hour before the show and the group heads in for seats about 15 minutes before hand. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator and if it is downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather after the movie just outside the room where it was shown to talk about the movie a bit and get a head count of those who would like to come out for drinks, munchies and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studio: Dimension Films (The Weinstein Company)&lt;br /&gt;Director: Alexandre Aja&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Alexander Aja, Greg Levasseur, Pete Goldfinger, Josh Stolberg&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Jessica Szohr, Steven R.

But this year, there's something more to worry about than hangovers and complaints from local old timers; A new type of terror is about to be cut loose on Lake Victoria. After a sudden underwater tremor sets free scores of the prehistoric man-eating fish, an unlikely group of strangers must band together to stop themselves from becoming fish food for the area's new razor-toothed residents. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Meetup Badge.
