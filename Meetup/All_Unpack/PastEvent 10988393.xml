Sadly I had a bit of a car hiccup and thought it would be best to wait and see ...  Thankfully it looks like my car is up and ready to go ... better yet, just in case my car needs a holiday, Luis has put his hand up to say he and one of his pups - either coco or zues - will be there to get us on the trail.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hoping to hike the blue blaze skyline loop.   Leaving from the houghton's pond lot at &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;695 Hillside Street&lt;br /&gt;Milton, MA 02186&lt;br /&gt;617-698-1802&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking the best place to meet is at the playground right at the entrance to the pond.  Please know there are a number of lots in this area, thankfully I think there is only one play ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we are all there ... we can work out the hike details.  If everyone pups and people are up for it lets try for a 2-3 hour trek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll find Luis by looking for a tall dark hair man with a gorgeous brown american pit bull.  If you are looking for me I'll be the girl with dark hair next to the small white puff of a bichon, Breezy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chat soon,&lt;br /&gt;Kristan&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristan</member_name><member_id>8717151</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249746406000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248905365000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>explore the blue hills</name><id>10988393</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249219800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/10988393/</event_url></item>
