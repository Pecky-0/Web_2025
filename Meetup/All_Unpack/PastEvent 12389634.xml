If we can't get at least 5 RSVPs, I'll try in another time.&lt;br /&gt;The location is in east Cambridge, a few blocks from the Lechmere station green line, about 10 from Kendall red line. RSVP for address and phone number.&lt;br /&gt;I'm far from mastering Indian cuisine, and if it scares you, too, don't worry! If you're stumped just grab a frozen dish or samosas at Trader Joe's and join us anyway. Please bring your favorite beverage as well.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264547597000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club</urlname><id>1354358</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Near Boston 30 something cooking club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264133276000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indian Potluck</name><id>12389634</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264374000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club/events/12389634/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/c/global_6879276.jpeg</photo_url></item>
