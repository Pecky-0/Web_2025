Some of my climbing partners (Joe and Fawn Boyd Vigil and Kevin Pyles) and myself as well as staff from Exxel will be available to belay the children (of course we're bringing our own) while they're scaling the climbing walls (see &lt;a href="http://www.exxcel.net/photos/page_07.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.exxcel.net...&lt;/a&gt;, the wall is in the background). We're also planning to use the 100 feet zipline that lets kids race across the building while suspended with a harness from a zipline. Or they can try out their cargo net as well (see &lt;a href="http://www.exxcel.net/photos/page_15.htm)" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.exxcel.net...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, healthy fun for you and the kid(s) in your life. So ditch the Sunday morning cartoons and join us for some climbing. What could be better than that? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your child should be at least five years old to participate, siblings are welcome as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is limited to a total of 15 children. You can either sign up with myself or on the Boston Rocks meetup group at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt; if you're a member of Boston Rocks. If you're signing up via Boston Rocks please note that you're sign-up will count for your child, i.e. if you're singing up two children, you would register as yourself plus 1 guest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizational/Logistical Info:&lt;br /&gt;Date: Sunday, November 1, 4:00pm to 5:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Location: Exxcel Gymnastics &amp;amp; Climbing, 88 Wells Avenue, Newton, MA&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;a href="http://www.exxcel.net/exxcel_directions.html"&gt;http://www.exxcel.net...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $15 per child, payable to Exxcel, cash or check only, no credit cards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your kids should wear comfortable clothing and have a clean pair of sneakers for the climbing equipment.
