Our speaker will be Marilyn Santiesteban, who is a terrific consultant for career changers and job hunters.  Marilyn has more than 20 years' experience as a management consultant, and is a real pro at helping people recognize and &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;promote&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; their potential! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marilyn will be talking with us about how to create your own &amp;quot;brand&amp;quot;.  We all need to stand out in the crowd -- she can help us learn how!  Marilyn writes a terrific blog, btw, which I highly recommend:  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/layofflady" target="_blank"&gt;http://twitter.com/la...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fee is $5.00.  Please pay ahead (on the web site).  If you cannot do this, let me know.  I'm OK with accepting money at the meeting, but I hate to spend precious meeting time hitting people up for their $5.00!  Thanks.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will definitely be a raffle, and anyway...this is a NETWORKING meeting, ladies!  Please bring business cards!!  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/tongue.gif' border='0' alt='tongue' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the change in day is a problem for anyone, please let me know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, Karen &lt;br /&gt;617-650-8716&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture on the site.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen K.</member_name><member_id>3407018</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250810714000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Professional Women</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Women-in-Business-Network</urlname><id>997886</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Women in Business Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246015614000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Moving on?
