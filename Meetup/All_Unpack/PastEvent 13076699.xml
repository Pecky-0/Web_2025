You will see how unique each one’s business is, and realize that you too need to think creatively about designing your business as well as your fashion product and/or service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are especially inviting fashion merchandisers who might be interested in interning for Boston designers in “selling direct to consumers”. We are starting some discussion on how to make the Boston fashion industry uniquely successful from New York or Los Angeles by developing systems of direct sales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following are panelists:&lt;br /&gt;SHIRLEY WILLETT will show and explain a few styles from her history of 63 years of creative high fashion pattern, production &amp;amp; manufacturing. And her evolution of fashion as 3D sculptures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TESS COBURN (Tersesa Crowninshield, Elegant Silk and Cashmere Coats and Jackets for Women) will tell her story of how she began in China and became remarkably successful. She returns to China each year to produce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANN RUSSO (Ann Russo Technical Design Services, Inc.) will tell how she started and developed her technical services of pattern making and Computer Grading and Marking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOTAM MENDLINGER, Accessory designer in NYC, will talk about the &lt;br /&gt;problems of producing small quantities and producing in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOM STEIN (Berklee College of Music professor) has a startup business involving fashion and music. He will talk about “Current Trends In The Relationship Between Fashion and Music”. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be other designers as we get their commitments. &lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Willett and Evan Shapiro&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Ranere</member_name><member_id>975035</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan</member_name><member_id>2523024</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272060414000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>fashionandmusic</urlname><id>1390310</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Fashion and Music Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270314927000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DESIGNERS PANEL</name><id>13076699</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271887200000</time><rsvp_limit>31</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fashionandmusic/events/13076699/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/1/6/global_12633862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
