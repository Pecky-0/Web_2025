RSVP, drive or ride. Should be good as always. Although it starts at 6:30, we might want to decide on eating at the restaraunt at the hotel before the seminar. So leaving FIT no later than 5 might do it. -------------------------------------------------------- -------------------(Boston/Bedford Glen) 44 Middlesex Turnpike Bedford, MA 01730 Hotel Phone: (781) 275-5500 Located at what used to be the Renaissance Bedford Hotel.
