We invite you to make holiday memories with us by visiting The Breakers, The Elms and Marble House, all decked out for the holidays. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of poinsettia plants, spectacular evergreens, trees, wreaths and fresh flowers and 19th century style ornaments turn the houses and their grounds into a Yuletide wonderland. Dining tables set with period silver and china and mannequins dressed in authentic costumes complete the elegant setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be visiting the fabulous homes of the once elite in Newport. The homes are by far, a sight to behold and give a glimpse to a bygone era. We will depart at 9am and arrive in Newport at approximately 11:00. We will view one mansion and break for lunch.  We will then view the remaining 2 mansions. We'll break for dinner, which I am arranging thru a local restaurant in the area for around 6 pm. Of course, you are free to do your own thing...shop, dinner on your own, but if you would like to join us for dinner... feel free. Afterwards you can depart for home or do your own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The restaurant I have made reservations at is The Mooring. Take a look at their sumptuous menu...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mooringrestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mooringres...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mansions...The Breakers, The Elms and The Marble House, as you have never seen them before.&lt;br /&gt;See all three houses and save. Winter Passport ticket (daytime admission to all three) is $28 for adults, $9 for children 6-17.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets try to meet at a predetermined spot and drive up together. We will carpool and I will ask if anyone will volunteer to drive. Your (drivers) gas and parking will be shared and covered by your passengers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So join us for this most festive occasion and daytrip. Enjoy the beauty while sharing the warmth of the season with good friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for  Terri or Chuck or the Meetup Sign...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>chuck</member_name><member_id>11483387</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292125138000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289424102000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Magic at The Newport Mansions!!!</name><id>15407499</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292076000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/15407499/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_19537468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
