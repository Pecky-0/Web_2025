<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 200 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 9:00 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 9:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;* Take 691 East &amp;amp; get off at exit 12.(Preston Ave)&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp turn left.&lt;br /&gt;* Go 2 miles to first stop sign &amp;amp; turn right onto Bee Street.&lt;br /&gt;** Go thru 1st stop sign &amp;amp; pass Fairways restaurant on your left.&lt;br /&gt;* Entrance to Giuffrida Park a short distance down on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 91 South get off at exit 19.&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp turn right.&lt;br /&gt;* Go to first stop sign &amp;amp; turn right onto Bee St.&lt;br /&gt;* Follow above directions rest of way (**).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
