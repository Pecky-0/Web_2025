Hopefully, the 3rd time will be a charm (flight issues and weather forced cancellations of the 2 previous attempts). If you know anyone else who may be interested, please feel free to bring them along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a book they'd care to recommend, or provide a review on for the group, please let me know via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, bringing questions regarding a favorite stock from your own watchlists (or perhaps even a trade from the past) for a group critique is very much encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room). If you should arrive after the doors have been locked, please knock loudly so we can hear you, and wait long enough for someone to get to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a ﻿﻿lively and engaging discussion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Green,&lt;/p&gt;
