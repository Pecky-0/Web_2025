Amy Graver, the founder and principal of Elements and a member of our group, will participate on a mini-panel about the business of design.  I am looking for two more volunteers who have experience running a design business to join her.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The panel will take about 30-45 minutes, leaving plenty of time for mingling before and after.  Light refreshments will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, October 4&lt;br /&gt;5.30pm - 7.30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elements LLC&lt;br /&gt;King's Block&lt;br /&gt;20 Grand Avenue&lt;br /&gt;New Haven, CT 06513&lt;br /&gt;(Corner of Grand and Front along Quinnipiac River)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is parking on-site accessible from Front Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be there and I hope that you can all make it too!
