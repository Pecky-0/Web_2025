<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Jonathan Stiebel leads a distance learning startup focusing on interactive teaching of children ages 7 to 12. In context of this startup he has been leading the development and integration of technologies such as Python, Javascript, and Flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night's discussion will be a journey through the integration of Java under Javascript control to enable recording of audio. At the beginning of the session, the discussion leader will present an overview of what he wishes the Java code to accomplish, and he will pose several specific questions to the fellow participants.  The participants will break out into groups of between 2 and 3 people (ideally) to review his handout with the challenges, and to discuss and propose solutions to each of the challenges.  Then the group will reconvene. Each small group will appoint a leader to report orally to the large group how they would address the challenges.  The discussion leader will summarize with the lessons he learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is currently an opening at the company for Chief Technology Officer.  A suitable candidate should be able to create a rich client-side user experience with a depth and breadth of tools.  A deep understanding of audio digital signal processesing and an ability to creatively solve complex math challenges would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>ask for the java meetup</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273098873000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Java Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-java</urlname><id>87071</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Java Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268739668000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Java April Meetup</name><id>ljcdnyngbzb</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272925800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-java/events/12889667/</event_url></item>
