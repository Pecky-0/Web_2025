Presented By Patricia Rainville....Patricia has been in the health and wellness business for 20 years. It began in 1990 with massage school where I found my true calling in the fields of alternative medicines and energies. While there I became interested in Reiki healing energy and became a reiki master. I also became interested in aromatherapy and herbs as a way to enhance healing and spent a season apprenticing with an herbalist. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

In this class we will learning about specific Archangels to work with, as well as developing/enhancing our spiritual and intuitive abilities known as the "clairs". We will also be learning to develop our skills of non-verbal or telepathic communication. &lt;br /&gt;
