This event will also be posted on the Random Hiking Group calendar, please RSVP on only one of the two calendars.  When purchasing your tickets, please note that there are two evenings of different films...Monday and Tuesday.  Wednesday evening is a repeat of Monday night's films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The films are scheduled to begin at 7 pm...so lets meet at 6:30 pm to be sure that we have seats.  I will try to reserve some but people tend to get a bit cranky about that when they see that the seats are not occupied.  I plan on getting there by about 6 or 6:15 pm.  I may wait near the entrance for a bit but will probably head inside to guard the seats.  Please let me know ASAP if you will not be joining us or if you will be late.  If you do not think you will be there between 6:30 and 6:45 pm, please let me know...I will not hold any seats after 6:45 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please purchase your tickets PRIOR to posting a &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; RSVP and update your RSVP if your plans change.  These films sell out every year so it is wise to buy your tickets in advance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.regenttheatre.com/events/banff09.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.regentthea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.regenttheatre.com/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.regentthea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainculture/tour/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.banffcentr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>naturegirl</member_name><member_id>3135826</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235780156000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231115902000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Banff Mountain Film Festival 2009!</name><id>9444369</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235520000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9444369/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/global_3834185.jpeg</photo_url></item>
