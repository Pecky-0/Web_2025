As far as I am aware, there will be many RPG, CCG, LAN, and other games running all weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be running a game as well, from 12-5 on Saturday- a dungeon crawl in Rappan Athuk. I'll have pre-generated characters available, one for each character class, or you can bring your own 6th-level core character. People can come and go as they want, so let's see how far into the Dungeon of Graves we can get!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172220020000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171567770000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TempleCon</name><id>5484303</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171630800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/5484303/</event_url></item>
