Do something for yourself and the glory of your meetup, and block off as much of your Sunday as you can for all-you-can-play trivia. You can come for as short or as long a time as you want, and we can all play together since there are no caps to team size. Basically as long as someone hands in answer sheets with the team name it counts, so you can take breaks whenever you need. This is a celebration of ten years of BQT, based in New York but with nearly monthly matches in Cambridge. From noon until 10PM or your brain and/or body gives out, whichever comes first. I'll be there at least 15-20 minutes before start time.&lt;/p&gt;
