Am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of you have requested a meetup where we discuss dream interpretation.  Bob and I have been studying dreams for years and would love to share some things we have learned about how to look for the deeper meaning of dreams.  We also invite you to share some of your techniques as well.  In addition, we'll lead a contemplative spiritual exercise to consciously access your dream worlds.  We did this last time and someone suggested we repeat this and give people more time with it. So we will!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd also like to invite everyone to ask their inner guides/angels/masters for a special dream that they can bring with them to this discussion. Be sure to write it down so that you remember it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're trying a new location this month...one that is easily accessible.  No stairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Isabelle&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The community room is to the right of the bank entrance.  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabelle Morton</member_name><member_id>10332926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272300424000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group</urlname><id>1551111</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Central Connecticut Spiritual Experiences Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270568560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dream Interpretation</name><id>13102900</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272126600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group/events/13102900/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/2/global_11631042.jpeg</photo_url></item>
