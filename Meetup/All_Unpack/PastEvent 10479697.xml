Last week we had a pretty good showing as we took 3rd place in the Trivia.  Who knows, we might have even won had we known the element number 13 in the Periodic Table and that Senator from Ohio!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there this week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for people in running gear just outside the bar</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243551787000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243125305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Training and Trivia</name><id>10479697</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243378800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10479697/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
