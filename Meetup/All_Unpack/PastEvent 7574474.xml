Bring some infromation about your wine and were you bought it.   There are usually 4 -5 full glasses of wine per bottle.  That would be 8 to 10 tasting glasses. Depending on how many people are coming  I may ask people to pair up to bring two of the same wine.  I've not done a home wine tasting before so any suggestions would be helpful.  It would be good to have three white and three red depending on the amount of people.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be preparing cheese and crackers and fruit.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy AKA Jeanine</member_name><member_id>5547282</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212274188000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><why>Because its the Memorial day week end.</why><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206070318000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Memorial Day  Wine Tasting</name><id>7574474</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211581800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/7574474/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/0/global_2943360.jpeg</photo_url></item>
