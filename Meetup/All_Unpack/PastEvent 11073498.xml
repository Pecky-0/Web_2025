However, we live on a very busy main street, so hold tight to your pug while coming into the yard. &lt;br /&gt;Parking is allowed on the street. &lt;br /&gt;If you need directions please contact me through email.  jwebster@mitre.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE:  This is a sun only event.  If it rains we will have to cancel.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fonzismom</member_name><member_id>4237883</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252758636000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-MA-Pugs</urlname><id>461198</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9599990845</group_lon><name>The Northshore MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249865748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FONZI'S BIRTHDAY BASH </name><id>11073498</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250967600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-MA-Pugs/events/11073498/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/0/global_10299648.jpeg</photo_url></item>
