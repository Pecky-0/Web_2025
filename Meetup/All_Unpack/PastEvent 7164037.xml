Fighting against the darkness, our heroes marched onward and upward, never faltering, never surrendering. Ultimate was to be had, no matter the conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illuminated discs flew threw the air, slicing rain droplets in half, making onlookers smile and gasp. The rain let up in fear of our might; this group of frisbee aficionados was obviously not to be sullied by mere Mother Nature. The promise (and premise) of frisbee-at-night draws nice people out of their basements and caves and into the bright, illustrious night. It gives hope to the depressed and strength to the weak and youth to the old. The ultimate panacea, frisbee cures what ails ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Albeit wet, the irresistible glow of the frisbee lives on this Tuesday. While the &lt;a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/fitness/wxdetail/02120?dayNum=1&amp;amp;from=36hr_fcst_fitness" target="_blank"&gt;weather forecast&lt;/a&gt; may call for snow and showers, our hearts still call for the disc. We will play Tuesday night, 7 PM, Cambridge Common, regardless of the conditions. Or we'll just go out to dinner. Either way, come on by, dress warm (and with light-colored clothing!), and bring a smile along with a change of socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris McClelland bids ye all farewell,&lt;br /&gt;call him if you want to chat: 781 301 1791.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim O'Neill</member_name><member_id>4585507</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201226169000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200937076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Illuminated Frisbee on Cambridge Common on a dark and stormy night.</name><id>7164037</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201046400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7164037/</event_url></item>
