Come and join us if you are interested in learning about these spiritual topics in ways that are strikingly bold and thought-provoking and can move you to a new level consciousness if that is what you seek. &lt;br /&gt;The first topic of the weekend is sure to generate some very interesting conversation: Men, Sex, and Honesty. The myth of male sexual 'needs' and prowess have caused endless heartaches for women and children. Using the body to indulge sensual pleasures is done at the expense of those being used for this purpose. The male drive for sex is really driven by unresolved feelings that need expression and undeveloped skills in relating through interpersonal communication. Come and learn the right relationship of men to their feelings, sexuality, communication, and commitment. This seminar is open to both men and women. &lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the presenter: &lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher. Currently, he serves as Co-Director of the Order of Christ/Sophia, teaching spiritual students, and guiding the operation of fifteen schools of meditation around the country. He travels between these Centers year-round, teaching and lecturing, as well as performing his music as a singer-songwriter of Mystical Christian folk rock. Many of the elements of the Mystical Christian teachings can be heard and experienced in Father Peter's music, encouraging the listener to seek and discover the Truth within. Listen to his music on Sophia Radio. When not traveling, Father Peter lives at the Center of Light in Chicago, IL.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
