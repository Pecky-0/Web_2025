If you haven't met Albert before he is easy to recognize.  He is a handsome fawn colored pug with a very buff build to him.  If you are still having difficulty recognizing our birthday boy then try to locate his mom who is a hip looking blonde who might be wearing big Chanel sunglasses and she will introduce you to Albert.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2407140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pug Devotee Extraordinaires</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-73</urlname><id>126274</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1115405304000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pug Meet Up</name><id>4690834</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1116079200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-73/events/4690834/</event_url></item>
