<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce the first Karaoke Sunday event for our meetup group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is Father's Day. Feel free to bring your Dad along! This is a &lt;strong&gt;non-exclusive&lt;/strong&gt; event which means that we will be mixing in with the venue's regular patrons. The good news: No fee for attending. The bad news: longer waits for your turn at the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can sit together as a group or we can mingle with everybody else. In fact, you don't need to sign up for this meetup; you can just show up. However, I am hoping that there will be enough interest eventually to arrange a regular exclusive Karaoke event similar to the monthly meetup at The Courtside. So, it will help a lot to get a rough head count if you do sign up for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see many of you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randall.&lt;/p&gt;
