This ride is about 14 miles in each direction, about 28 miles round trip. It is supposed to be very scenic and a nice ride from the reports of other members.  I've changed meetup location as members suggested that the Sanford Brown formerly Gibbs College location is better, so that's were will meet. summer's here,bike season is on It's nice to see  alot of members enjoying this nice summer weather, and meeting fun, active,enthusiastic, people like yourself! Hope to see alot of you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Parking lot at Sanford Brown formerly Gibbs College USA Flag On Car</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340342415000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333933481000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Ride Washington Secondary Bike Path,Cranston-Coventry, R.I.</name><id>59771182</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339941600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/59771182/</event_url></item>
