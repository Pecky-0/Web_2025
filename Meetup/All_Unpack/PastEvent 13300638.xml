Please make note that we're meeting a week early as the last Sunday of the month falls on Memorial Day Weekend.  Yesterday's discussion of &amp;quot;The Glass Castle&amp;quot; was fascinating as we explored the dynamics of a very disfunctional family. We had 15 participants so there was a real sense that you were surrounded by like-minded people all interested in good books and a great discussion.&lt;br /&gt;I haven't read the book yet (I'm starting tonight!) but one of our readers says she just finished it and it's fantastic.  Her whole hearted endorsement encouraged us all to get started.  So...curl up and get reading.  See you at the end of May.
