Unable to cope with a recent personal tragedy, LA's top celebrity shrink (Kevin Spacey) turns into a pothead with no concern for his appearance and a creeping sense of his inability to help his patients.

Shrink is directed by Jonas Pate a filmmaker from North Carolina of only The Grave and Deceiver previously as well as a handful of TV show episodes. The screenplay was written by newcomer Thomas Moffett of only Frost previously. This premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and was eventually bought by Roadside Attractions. Shrink arrives in limited theaters starting on July 24th.
