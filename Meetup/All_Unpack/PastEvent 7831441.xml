<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Christopher Wong, Sr. Software Engineer at &lt;a href="http://www.makanasolutions.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Makana Solutions&lt;/a&gt; will lead a discussion of Groovy at the next Boston Java Meetup. Owing to a scheduling conflict that I have, the date for the meetup has changed to Monday, June 2nd at 6.30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;My primary programming language at Makana is Groovy. Why? I will give an intro to Groovy, a tour of its major power features and discuss its place in the Java universe. We can talk about why you should (or should not) use Groovy in your Java projects.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetings are personal, engaging and everybody is sharing in the topic at hand. Come and share your experience with your peers. Presentations/discussions are held at MIT's EHS Office, 265 Massachusetts Ave, upstairs from the MIT Museum; drinks/food are at bar near by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Thank you to the many members that RSVP (one way or another). This helps your humble organizer to manage the crowd at the venue.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The entrance is a gray door to the right of the main Museum entrance.
