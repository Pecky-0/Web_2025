You are the star of the October Python Meetup, when we have the first Cambridge Python Lab -- workshop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lab and the problem in it were inspired by and excerpted from &amp;quot;Core Python &lt;br /&gt;Programming.  The Python challenges range in complexity (from easy to challenging) and each one has multiple potential solutions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenges can be solve with brute force computing, a complex AST, or even a database solution. So it is up to you and the skills of those on your team -- because our focus is on learning from each other.  We'll discuss sample solutions and discuss each solutions tradeoffs or 'issues.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug Napoleone and George Lambert proposed this to the present membership last month and everyone agreed -- just before we headed over to the Independent for beers. (Hmm.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bring a laptop and your thinking caps. We'll have teams of 4-5 working on one portable. We'll see if we can distribute the material before hand if possible.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, drinks and pizza will be served -- thanks for the donations they go to the cost of food and the use of Meetup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter Marquez</member_name><member_id>4000314</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192846151000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190246817000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Cambridge Python October Meetup</name><id>6391989</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192662000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/6391989/</event_url></item>
