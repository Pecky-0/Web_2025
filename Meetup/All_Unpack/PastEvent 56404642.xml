<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;For our March meeting, we're in a new spot!&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Rue La La&lt;/strong&gt; is providing the location, the food, and the drinks!&amp;nbsp; We have two great speakers, RSVP at &lt;a href="http://meetu.ps/81SQz"&gt;http://meetu.ps/81SQz&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Wiles: Django Developer's Survival Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank will take us through a quick tour of the must have tools for the modern Django developer: South, Django Debug Toolbar, Celery, Fabric, Haystack, Tastypie, IPython, and so on. &amp;nbsp;Frank runs Revolution Systems in Lawrence Kansas, and has built large Django projects for clients across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Tauber: You Used Python for What?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a break from his usual web development, James will give an overview of some of the more unusual things he's done with Python: from graded readers for Ancient Greek to analyzing piano performances; from emulating an Apple ][ to the beginnings of an operating system written in Python. James is the leader of the Pinax project, and runs Eldarion virtually from Burlington, MA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, a Boston perspective on last week's &lt;strong&gt;PyCon 2012&lt;/strong&gt; in Santa Clara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinks and socializing&lt;/strong&gt; included, in Rue La La's spacious headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting to Rue La La:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALKING&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;From South Station (8 - 10 minutes):&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Coming out of South Station, turn right onto Summer Street. Follow Summer Street over the bridge toward South Boston. Immediately following the bridge, you will see a building on your right with a sign for &amp;ldquo;Neighborhood Health Plan&amp;rdquo; and a convenience store. Take this right, down a stairwell that will take you parallel to the water. Follow this path all along the water. There will be a big parking lot on your left, and once you come to the far corner, take a left (you&amp;rsquo;ll be headed towards the brick buildings. This will take you to A Street, which runs right in front of the Channel Center. #20 is the building diagonally across the street to your right. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;DRIVING&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Follow I-93 North to exit 15 for Columbia Road, turn right at Columbia Road (signs for South Boston). At Kosciuszko Circle, take the 3rd exit onto Columbia Road/3A and follow it for 0.6 miles. At Columbia Road Rotary, take the 2nd exit onto Old Colony Avenue. Continue straight onto Dorchester Avenue then turn right onto A Street. You will then take a right onto Iron Street and a left at Channel Center Street. Arrive at 20 Channel Center Street. The entrance is about halfway down the building (you can enter on either side). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;From the West:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Follow I-90 East to exit 25 toward South Boston, keep left at the fork in the ramp. Turn left onto Congress Street, turn left onto A Street, then turn left on Iron Street. Arrive at Channel Center Street. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;Parking:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 There are four lots to choose from. One small lot is directly attached to the Channel Center, at a rate of $12/day. This is primarily used by employees with monthly passes, but you can pay with a credit card or cash when you park. Across the street from the entrance is a large lot ($11), which accepts cash or check when you exit. Next to that lot on the right is a parking garage, which is $11/day ($10 if you&amp;rsquo;re in before 9 and out before 6). They only accept credit cards, and you&amp;rsquo;ll pay on your way out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ned Batchelder</member_name><member_id>1824278</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349612835000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>30</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>118</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331774326000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Django Tools and Crazy Things (New Location!)</name><id>56404642</id><headcount>80</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332457200000</time><rsvp_limit>120</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/56404642/</event_url></item>
