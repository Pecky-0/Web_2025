&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's hard to believe that the Friends of Myles Standish are getting ready to celebrate the conclusion of six years since our founding.  Under our bylaws, some of our founding members including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Former President Sharl Heller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vice President Evelyn Strawn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jim Nelson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob Bentley  (of the Bentley Loop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thom Gifford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have to step down from the board this year. (Sharl has already stepped down.) &lt;span&gt;Two other directors, Helga Stottmeier and Laura Troll, are also leaving us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W&lt;span&gt;e want to hold our annual dinner to celebrate all the hard work these people have done for the Friends and to remember their and your accomplishments in the forest over the last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the election of new directors and officers, there are a number of proposed changes in our by-laws that have to be approved at a members meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will also have a talk by local author and birding expert &lt;strong&gt;John Galuzzo&lt;/strong&gt; on "Birding like it's 1839". John has been spending the year finding out what it was like to go birding in 1839. Join him to hear all about his plans to find Massachusetts’ mysterious "Ambiguous Sparrow" and the other birds known to bird enthusiasts of those early days. (&lt;span&gt;John Galluzo, has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/John-J-Galluzzo/e/B001JP7JUO" target="_blank"&gt;authored more than 30 books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, including many in the popular "Images of America" series.   A recent work, "Half an hour a day on foot: An obsessive exploration of the Nature and History of the South Shore of Boston", &lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/0/event_226203792.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sounds intriguing.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
