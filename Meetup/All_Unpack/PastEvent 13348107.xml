In German with subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1936, the Eiger peak in the Swiss Alps was still unattainable to mountain climbers, unable to scale the 5,900-foot near-vertical north side “murderwall.” Phillipp Stölzl’s thrilling true story opens as the Nazi government drafts Toni Kurz (Benno Fürmann) and Andi Hinterstoisser (Florian Lukas) in a suicidal effort to win glory for the Fatherland. As comfortable officials watch from a hotel, the two climbers meet with terror as they battle injuries, vicious blizzards, equipment failure, and the impossible height of their quest. While the story itself is nail-biting, the film’s real drama comes from the awesome images of Eiger shot on location by cinematographer Kolja Brandt. “A mountaineering adventure more tense, more edge-of-the-seat suspenseful, than Touching the Void - Almost incredibly, this German drama is that film.” Anthony Quinn, The Independent, UK &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;121 min.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be on the bench outside.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273621379000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272718039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Face</name><id>13348107</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273447800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/13348107/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
