<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Here's the deal: The concert is at 7 pm rain or shine at the DCR Hatch Shell in Boston. I would like to meet at the Park and Ride lot in Millbury, off Route 20, or off exit 10A of the Mass Pike and carpool to the Riverside MBTA station in Newton. We'll take the green line to the Arlington street station which is a close walk to the Hatch Shell. The concert starts at 7 pm, and is usually over by 10 pm. This is important: BRING A CHAIR. The kind that you can carry in a bag. Otherwise, you'll sit on the hard ground all night.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My car is a green Nissan Sentra with the lic number 9593 ZL</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorena Nozzolillo</member_name><member_id>4168426</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216076761000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>It will be fun</why><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211499855000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oldies Free Concert - Guess Who at the DCR Hatch Shell</name><id>7994649</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215903600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/7994649/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/7/global_4038951.jpeg</photo_url></item>
