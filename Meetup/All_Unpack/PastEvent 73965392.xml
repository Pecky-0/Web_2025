His experiences led to a "you can go home again" reflection on his family and country. "For the outsider, this memoir offers a poignant vision exotic in cultural particulars, familiar in intimate human feelings."  Margaret Atwood calls it "[b]rightly coloured, sweet and painful, bloody-minded and otherworldly ... [it] achieves the status of legend." The New Yorker calls it "[e]loquent, oblique, witty, full of light and feeling .… Ondaatje’s knowledge of the fragility and luck of life is very clear. So, too, is the grace and originality of his prose."&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be downstairs with a copy of the book on the table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>H H</member_name><member_id>6628358</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345049696000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1481208</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342663738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Running in the Family by Michael Ondaatje</name><id>73965392</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344897000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Book-Club-Meetup-Group/events/73965392/</event_url></item>
