&lt;p&gt;I'll take any 4in or 6in plastic pots you want to recycle. If you would like to swap plants, bring them in pots 4in &amp;amp; 6in size, my plants will be from $2-5 mostly. I have dug out lots in pots now and will have lots more, plant list on my web page below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have invited other garden clubs as well so come on over to my backyard and meet lots of other gardeners and people interested is seeing lovely gardens and get some gardening ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll also have Neptune's Harvest organic, local, fertilizer available to purchase. A lot of people swear by it to grow the best tomatoes and a farmer grew an 1800 lb pumpkin with it, world's record! All purchases are cash only to keep my expenses down and your costs per plant...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who likes to paint or take pictures, come on over, lots to see in the gardens!&lt;/p&gt;
