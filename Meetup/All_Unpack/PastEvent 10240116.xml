We'll head up along the edge of Pine Acres Lake to Governor's Island. You'll want hiking boots or at least sneakers, because it can be a bit muddy at points. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will probably take about two hours, so bring a bottle of water and a snack, if you like.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the trail is flat and not at all technical -- there is one patch which has a lot of boulders we'll need to clamber over, a couple of small streams to cross, but nothing steep.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the parking area opposite the museum before we begin the hike.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Northrop</member_name><member_id>8657197</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242340854000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240371422000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May Hike to Governor's Island </name><id>10240116</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241283600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/10240116/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_6487468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
