Please make sure to RSVP if you are planning on coming (or think you may be coming) so that I know to wait for you. See you tomorrow! And don't make me ANGRY! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/angry.gif' border='0' alt='angry' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808495230/info" target="_blank"&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/a&gt; deserves a second shot. Let's go see the Green Guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet outside the theater and then go in and buy our discounted tickets together. (Tix are $8.50 each to FMM members and their guests; instead of $10.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome. Just be sure to include them in your RSVP so I know how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go out after the movie to discuss it and chat, if people are game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell number is 508/308-4897 if you need to RSVP last minute (like w/in 2 hours of the show). The exact time of the show will be updated a few days before, as movie times don't come out this far ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My email is dana@framesbydana.com. Email me if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;?Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing my Meetup nametag and waiting outside by the parking lot.
