 &lt;br /&gt;

Come one, come all to one of our ever popular Sunday Brunches…Due to the huge number of graduates in the Boston area, I have moved this event to the Cheesecake Factory. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We we dine outside on the patio, weather permitting.  Bring some extra light clothes if it is slightly cool. Otherwise we will eat inside. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Choose your entree from a selection of delicious offerings and enjoy the conversations &amp;amp; laughter of your fellow diners. Mark and I have been hosting this brunch for over 9 months and everyone enjoys the group. We now have friends that attend frequently. This is a good opportunity to greet Meetup people. We usually get 44 members and guests. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Attendees are responsible for their own meal; please pay server. Paypal is not accepted at this event. Plenty of parking in the rear. &lt;br /&gt;
