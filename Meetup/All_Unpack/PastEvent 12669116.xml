But there were limericks written and shared last time, so who knows...anything is possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a little pre-St. Patty's celebration, we are heading to Christopher's in Porter, which has mucho beers on tap and really great burgers. That means I had to make a reservation, which means I had to cap RSVP's, which means everyone needs to RSVP and MEAN it! Oh and you all need to either get dinner or drinks so we'll be welcome back again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Kate party!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>3324571</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1269388387000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266809246000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Luck o' the Writing Exercises</name><id>12669116</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268780400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/12669116/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
