Fall foliage does not happen every day, so for this hike and picnic, come in a relaxed mode, without any day end deadlines to meet, as depending on the wishes of the group, this hike could go longer than planned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, estimate about 5 - 6 miles for distance and 4 - 5 hours for time (including a full hour relaxing over that huge picnic lunch that you will have earlier packed!) so that we can see the foliage over the river while we are eating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to follow closer to the time.  FYI, the sanctuary does not allow dogs due to birds and wildlife. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially given the time of year and that the number of RSVPs may be higher than usual, please be 100% sure of your plans before signing up for this one.   There will be another one, this time breakfast instead of picnic, this coming Saturday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing some of my regulars and to meeting many for the first time perhaps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a silver Subaru at the far end of the lot; we will be wearing Meetup stickers</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Randy</member_name><member_id>10613717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1287997017000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285155043000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall Outing at Ipswich River!</name><id>14856233</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287926100000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/14856233/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/a/global_18158666.jpeg</photo_url></item>
