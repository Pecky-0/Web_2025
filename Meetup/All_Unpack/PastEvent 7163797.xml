We will be learning, playing with and discussing High Key and Low Key lighting techniques. Both lighting styles make an intensive use of contrast, but in a very different way. When approaching this shoot of a dramatic fine art nude portrait, the decision of making it a High Key or Low Key image has great impact about the mood that these photographs will convey. While High Key images are considered bright and full of light ~ Low Key images are dramatic and convey a lot of contrast and tension. Let's explore those two dramatic lighting alternatives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also this workshop will teach lighting, posing, and communication. Photographers will learn how to find models, set expectations, and get answers to basic question on dealing with models. Learn the basic techniques about being comfortable with the models and having the models be comfortable with you.&lt;br /&gt;Learn about room composition and lighting to optimize your images. In the hands on shooting and lighting techniques section of the workshop you?ll learn lighting scenarios and achieve the effect you are looking for in a constructive and enjoyable way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our focus will be creating images.
