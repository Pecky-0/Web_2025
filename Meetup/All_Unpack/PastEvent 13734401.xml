We'll hike the Mount A area and then head for another hiking trail and picnic in a quiet wooded area a short distance away.  I'm estimating the combined hike and picnic will last about   &lt;br /&gt;3 - 3 1/2 hours or so with about 6 miles of total hiking.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the Mount Agamenticus Conservation Area: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.agamenticus.org/recreation.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.agamenticus.org/recreation.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.agamenticu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just click on the various tabs in the left column for more details. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the middle day of the 3-day holiday weekend, so traffic will be at its quietest both northbound and southbound&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;   For those unfamiliar with York, Mount A is nowhere near the beach with all its inherent holiday traffic and crowds - in fact, the area where we will be is at the opposite end of town.  For those who choose to do so, you can certainly head to the beach after the hike and continue to enjoy the rest of the day near the ocean.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll send along the directions later.  Pack along a big picnic lunch, beverages - and a can of bug spray!  I'll look forward to seeing you then!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy  &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>For the first few hikers, we will meet near my vehicle (silver Subaru Forester) across the street from the  parking lot.  After that, we will gather at the edge of the parking lot near the big rocks.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Randy</member_name><member_id>10613717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278411207000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275992059000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike and Picnic Lunch in York!</name><id>13734401</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278252000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/13734401/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/a/global_8053098.jpeg</photo_url></item>
