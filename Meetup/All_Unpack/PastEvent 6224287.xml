Often She was imagined to be meek and mild, meaning weak and without backbone. In fact, Mary was the greatest embodiment of the Divine Feminine ever to walk the earth. How was it that She came to be so maligned and how is it that She is now once again arising to Her full stature with such titles as Queen of Heaven and Mother of God? Come share with us a time of learning about Mother Mary and entering into the blessings of coming to know Her. Light lunch is included.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
