<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The first trailer for Richard Kelly’s new film The Box has appeared, and it appropriately tries to push a few buttons. The film stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as a couple with an increasingly desperate need for money. A box mysteriously appears on their doorstep, followed by Frank Langella, who presents an offer: push the button on the box and someone unknown to them will die, and they’ll be given a payment of one million dollars. The story is based off Richard Matheson’s short story Button, Button. See the trailer after the jump.

The film is a period piece, set in 1976, but the economic woes facing the characters make it fortuitously appropriate to now. Shot by Steven Poster, the trailer suggests that the film looks great, with some lush photography and art direction set against locations in and around Boston, MA.
