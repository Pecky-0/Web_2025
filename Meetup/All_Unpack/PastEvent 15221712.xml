<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the parking area at the Gale River Trail head in Bethlehem, on the Gale River Loop Road.  This is not a traverse, so no carpooling to another trailhead is necessary.  We'll ascend via the Gale River Trail to Galehead Hut and take the Frost trail to the summit (conditions permitting).  We will descend the same way.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for winter cold and potentially poor weather conditions. DO NOT WEAR COTTON OR DENIM. This can be dangerous in cold weather. If you have questions about how to prepare or how to dress, ask them in advance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answers to FAQs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some form of traction  and head lamps will be required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunrise is at 6:40.  Sunset will be at 4:40. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of this hike is below treeline and relatively unexposed.  The summit of Galehead is wooded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; I expect the hut to be closed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some very steep and rough sections on the Gale River Trail, so this is not a beginner or &amp;quot;getting back into it&amp;quot; hike.  If you do not have a number of recent 4,000 footer hikes under your belt, this is not a good one to jump into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not a speedy hiker, but I do keep a steady pace.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the conditions are prohibitive, I have no qualms about turning around.  The mountain will be there another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;My hikes area always dog friendly, but please know the limits and abilities of your dog in cold weather. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;I will watch the weather carefully and post weather updates during the week leading up to the hike.  I rely on NOAA and MWObs for my forecasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;RSVP Questions are not optional - If you do not provide me with a phone number to try and contact you on the morning of the hike (if necessary), I will NOT wait for you at the trailhead.&lt;/span&gt;  I will provide attendees with my cell phone number in advance of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book time is about 7 hrs, 30 minutes  10.2 miles. Plan on it taking this long, probably more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plagerized Trail Descriptions for your benefit &lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;Copyright Â© the Appalachian Mountain Club.

The trailhead is reached by leaving US 3 at its intersection with Trudeau Rd.  The trail enters the woods, soon descends a bank and crosses a tributary brook, then turns right on an old logging road that climbs easily along the west side of the north branch of the Gale River, some distance away from the stream.  At 1.4 miles it comes to the edge of teh stream, crosses it on a bridge at 1.7 miles and becomes somewhat rougher with several bypasses of muddy sections and washouts.  The trail passes trhough an old loggin-camp site, crosses a major tributary and recrosses to the west side of the North Branch at 2.5 miles on stepping stones (difficult only in high water).  After apassing the gravel outwash of an overgrown slide, the trail emerges at 3.1 miles on a gravel bank above the stream at the base of a slide, where there are fine views up teh valley and toward the twins.  The trail now becomes significantly steeper and rougher and ends with a fairly steep climb to the Garfield Ridge Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Garfield Ridge Trail (section&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;.6 miles &lt;br /&gt;20 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...the Garfield Ridge Trail now contours around the steep slope of Galehead Mtn, then turns right and climbs to a junction with the Twinway and teh Frost Trail 40 yards from Galehead Hut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frost Trail (from Galehead Hut to the Summit)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;4024'&lt;br /&gt;.5 miles&lt;br /&gt; 25 min&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This short trail leads from Galehead Hut to the summit of Galehead Mountain.  Leaving the hut clearing, it descends into a sag, then turns sharp right at a junction where the Twin Brook Trail eneters left.  After a short distance, the Frost Trail ascends a steep pitch, at the top of which a side path leads left 30 yards to an excellent outlook over the Twin Brook valley.  The main trail continues at a moderate grade to the rather flat summit, where there is a restricted view of Mt. Garfield and the Franconia Ridge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt; 10.2 miles (ROUND TRIP)&lt;br /&gt; 7hrs  30 minutes (ROUND TRIP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;DISCLAIMER (SHAMELESSLY PLAGERIZED FROM ANOTHER MEETUP HIKER): MY ROLE AS ORGANIZER IN THIS HIKE IS SOCIAL.
