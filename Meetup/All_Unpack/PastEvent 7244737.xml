A movie taking place in South-Africa. The story of a young man and his journey to redemption and forgiveness. (more details to follow.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month, the movie was on the life of &amp;quot;John of the Cross&amp;quot;. Many came to this inspiring movie.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the intriguing life story of one of the great poets of  Spain, Saint John of the Cross who became the leader with Teresa d?Avilla in the reform and renewal of the Carmelite order during the Golden age of Spain. This film has the depth and beauty of a 16th century masterpiece. Leonardo and Patt Defilippis play all the main characters, including John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila, and the film includes a cast of more than sixty extra. John?s mystical poem ?the Spiritual Canticle? runs as a connecting thread through the piece and the suspenseful story keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can come to enjoy this inspiring movie with us,&lt;br /&gt;Christine&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just come through the front door of the Center of Light.
