 Sorry this is last minute, but I just have to enjoy all of this beautiful snow we just got! So, hoping some of you will be able to join me snowshoeing on the trails at Mine Falls Park in Nashua. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. This park is just full of beautiful views, so come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will meet at 11:00 am in the lot at the end of Coliseum Ave, which is off of Rte 130 in Nashua. &lt;br /&gt;

 DIRECTIONS: Take exit 6 from Route 3 (Route 130) and go west towards Brookline, take the second entrance to the shopping center area (Colliseum Ave), go all the way to the end of the road for the parking lot. Look for the meetup sign. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails. &lt;br /&gt;

 If anyone cares to, we can then go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a hot chocolate, at a nearby restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;

 This event is at no cost. I hope to see you there. &lt;br /&gt;
