The purpose of this meeting is to give artists and models a chance to interact with each other and to have a fun afternoon of making art together. There will be multiple models that will rotate in and out of the session at will. We are having a meeting of models only prior to the drawing session to give new and aspiring models a chance to become comfortable and get training and tips from more experienced models. This will be an opportunity for them to get in front of a group of artist. I have participated as a model in other marathons like this and it has always been a lot of fun. I hope that you will come join us. There will be a $5 minimum donation requested to cover the cost of the venue and refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed</member_name><member_id>7904010</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327277702000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Art Models and Artists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NE-artists-models-group</urlname><id>408475</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>New England Artists/Models Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322863331000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Drawing Marathon</name><id>43193652</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326567600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NE-artists-models-group/events/43193652/</event_url></item>
