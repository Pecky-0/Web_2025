It is a nice, easy 2 hour walk with different types of terrain.  Single track trails as well as carriage trails.  There is a beautiful pond that we hike around.  The dogs really enjoy it there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luis - Sunday should be a great day. Let's enjoy a stroll in the woods. This is a lovely park, and our guide knows it like the back of her hands. Please let me know if the time is too early for folks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all for your input. I will be sure to turn more of these ideas into events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in a green Chevy pickup and Kate drives a blue Jeep Cherokee. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268143893000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267645691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Duxbury Forest, Duxbury, MA</name><id>12772245</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267970400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/12772245/</event_url></item>
