He is currently engaged in the design of a large urban project that includes high-rise office space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2006 he decided to bring his architectural training and experience to bear on what he believes is a key question for all building professionals to consider:  How did World Trade Center Building Seven and the Twin Towers fail symmetrically and completely, collapsing at near free-fall speed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Statements by more than 270 engineers and architects that are critical of the 9/11 Commission Report are now on record and can be viewed at PatriotsQuestion911.org. Alan Miller who collected these statements commented: ?Their collective voices give credibility to the claim that the 9/11 Commission Report is tragically flawed.  These individuals cannot be simply dismissed as irresponsible believers in some 9/11 conspiracy theory. Their sincere concern, backed by their professional responsibil-ities related to building design, construction, and other areas of engineering, demonstrates that criticism of the Commission Report is not inherently irresponsible or illogical, and that, in fact, it can be just the opposite.? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COME TO HEAR RICHARD GAGE ON FEB. 9TH AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHY A NEW INVESTIGATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information contact: Gerhard Bedding, 355-2202,  or Aaron Rothberg, 358-2590&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an article in the Keene Sentinel about the Monadnock group, see: &lt;a href="http://www.sentinelsource.com/main.asp?SectionID=31&amp;amp;SubSectionID=37&amp;amp;ArticleID=178322" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sentinelso...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;The event fee shown is a suggested carpooling &amp;quot;chip in.&amp;quot; I'm sure donations would be welcome to help cover Richard Gage's travel expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;For those who would like to get together before the official presentation, several folks will be meeting at the Thai restaurant across the street from the Colonial Theater (118 Main Street).
