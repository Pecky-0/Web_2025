&lt;p&gt;Sexuality is one of the most powerful forces in the world.  Nearly everything we experience as human beings is either initiated, sustained or destroyed through sexual artistry and power. The challenge for us, is that a great deal of our personal sexual potential has been untapped, unexplored - until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the framework of Tantra we are able to learn ways to access, cultivate and harness our sexual potential, thereby allowing it to operate in conscious ways in our lives.  Through conscious, dynamic relationship with our sexuality, we a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ctualize our specific gifts and contributions, we illuminate the true potential of humanity and the future of love. Love in a way and form that is revolutionary, yet something we all recognize and thirst for - down to the quarks and leptons in our very own bodies.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;You are invited to join Dawn Cartwright for an evening of dynamic conversation and experiential learning (insert date, time and location here).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Dawn Cartwright is a Tantric visionary, sacred writer, world traveler, and innovator in bio-energetic Tantra fusion. She discovered the path of Tantra by accident shortly after a period of life-changing mystical experiences in lovemaking. During her 20 years of teaching, she has integrated the Vigyan Bhairav roots of Tantra, Alexander Lowen’s teachings, the wisdom of Osho, and a microcosm-macrocosm approach to the body. Founder of the Chandra Bindu Tantra Institute in Santa Monica, California.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;We are very happy to announce Dawn will be teaching Ecstasy of the Heart, a weekend Tantra immersion in Plymouth, Massachusetts, November 16th - 18th.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
