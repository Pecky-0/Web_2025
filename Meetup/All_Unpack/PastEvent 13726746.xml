(at the former location of the Marius.)  There is of course the Irish wood work at the bar, a nice fireplace decor in the dinning room, and for those that want to get a table the patio.  (Sorry, I was unable to get us special consideration on the patio, though I'm sure they'll seat you on their half if you like.)  The menu features a mix of a few old Irish favorites (I hear the Fish and Chips has been Englishman approved at least) and more common american fare.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hour specials are served from 4-7 p.m. and include:  &lt;br /&gt;$3/4 Beers  &lt;br /&gt;$5 House Wine  &lt;br /&gt;$5 House Martinis  &lt;br /&gt;Free nibbles will be put out in the bar area.  &lt;br /&gt;(I'll see if I can convince them to extend the specials later, but no guarantees at this point.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (AJ) will host and can be reached at 315-345-9348.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about the Pub:  &lt;br /&gt;www.kellysnewhaven.com  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AJ</member_name><member_id>9920708</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>20</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279117583000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275936712000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour: Kelly's</name><id>13726746</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278972000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/13726746/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/5/global_15788853.jpeg</photo_url></item>
