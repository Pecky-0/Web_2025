Parking at the station is $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Minuteman Bikeway passes through the historic area where the American Revolution began in April 1775.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the Minuteman Bikeway is one of the most popular and successful rail-trails in the United States, enjoyed by thousands of people each day for both healthy recreation and transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikeway has become a new type of ?Main Street? where neighbors and strangers alike come together while riding, walking, or skating on the path.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on an inactive railroad, the Minuteman Bikeway has become a treasured regional resource, used by local residents and visitors from near and far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we will go to the Summer Shack for seafood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.summershackrestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.summershac...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;617-520-9500&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172502074000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170636705000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>minuteman bike trail walk</name><id>5453223</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172329200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5453223/</event_url></item>
