&lt;p&gt;The tasty life is what &amp;ldquo;La Vita Gustosa&amp;rdquo; means in Italian at this Ristorante Italiano. This restaurant is located a short walk from the East Haddam (42B) airport. After parking the plane and dropping a $5 landing fee in the honor box, a short walk up the road into the center of town of about &amp;frac14; mile will bring you to the classic Italian restaurant. The Goodspeed Opera House is across the street. Many of the patrons of the restaurant dine before going to the opera house. Dining can be formal or casual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food, there is plenty of food! All of the entrees were under $19.00 with many in the $9-15 dollar range. This restaurant serves the center of town and is supported only by a small percentage of pilots. Most of the business is from the townspeople and it has survived a long time attesting to the good food. And Like Matt says our flyouts seem to be all about food!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Goodspeed airport has a runway 14/32 and sports a 2120 x 50 foot runway. It is also a seaplane base Rick so if the river is not frozen????  &lt;br /&gt;There are no instrument approaches and fuel is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>show up at the terminal, Gary's hangar, or the active runway...You'll find us</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Bortle</member_name><member_id>6715847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306508770000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295181170000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ristorante Italiano !!!
