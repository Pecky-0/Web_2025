How about taking a day off on Friday or a half day and fly to Groton, CT for breakfast in Mystic. Here is the plan, we leave KFIT at 8:00 AM and fly south to Groton-New London. I have a van reserved at Landmar Aviation that Louise will drive us in safely to Mystic Seaport (by the way she is a very good driver). There is a tiny restaurant called &amp;quot;Little Kitchen&amp;quot; that is located right on the water, recommended by Rachael Ray. From there we can walk around explore the harbor then return to our planes around noon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystic was one of our best trips last year on a Friday night. This time we thought it would be fun to return back here during the day. Once a year we take a Friday off and its always very fun and relaxing. So please RSVP and come if you can. Invite your loved ones and bring your camera. This should be a lot of fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KGON" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary Archer</member_name><member_id>6716312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276888580000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275765067000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Groton CT.-Mystic Seaport (KGON) </name><id>13708509</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276862400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/13708509/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/7/global_15508903.jpeg</photo_url></item>
