We are very sorry for the mix-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi all, so we will be hosting outdoor games at the Common and hope for good weather this time! The Salem Commons offers shade and sun, plus plenty of room to spread out and play a variety of outdoor games. We only own a frisbee, so please bring whatever outdoor games you may have , such as croquet or horseshoes. After the event, if people are hungry, there are plenty of restaurants in walking distance. Remember to bring water or drinks as to stay hydrated and feel free to bring blankets, food or chairs to sit on. Hope to see you all then!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the Gazebo in the Common.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217283584000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216437220000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Outdoor Games on the Common!</name><id>8368566</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217102400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/8368566/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/0/global_3903920.jpeg</photo_url></item>
