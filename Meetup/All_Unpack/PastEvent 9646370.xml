For the winter we are going to sit by the fireplace and have the Bostons play outside (or inside if it is toooo cold).&lt;br /&gt;In February we had a great time! The bostons were so cute and Robyn took some great pictures really showing the reason why we love them so much.Their personalities are so so cute!!! Hope you can join in the fun!!!&lt;br /&gt;Bob and Linda&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>linda</member_name><member_id>4847348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238892608000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Boston Terriers and their Humans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-terrier-social</urlname><id>634864</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The Westport Boston Terrier Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233505001000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Westport Boston Terrier March Meetup</name><id>9646370</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235919600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-terrier-social/events/9646370/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/global_7116233.jpeg</photo_url></item>
