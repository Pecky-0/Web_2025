The Sky Lounge is a real classy, big &amp;quot;open air/concept&amp;quot; place at 522 Amherst Street, even though from the street, it looks like a small bar.  It's in the same plaza as Gold's Gym.&lt;br /&gt;The owners/managers let me use the entire upstairs lounge for the party :)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They have a good menu you can check it out at SkyLoungeNH.com, and of course there's a cash bar.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the schedule:&lt;br /&gt;46-58 years group starts at 6:00pm (filled for women...sorry gals) lots of new gals, guys :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; you must email me or call for confirmation, and pay at the door, at this point.  I'm pretty full right now.&lt;br /&gt;Please include in any correspondence the following information:&lt;br /&gt;Age/category you'd like to be included in, and your Name, Address, Phone and Email address.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested in a 55+ group please let me know, I will get a list together.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you again soon...you may even want to come back again :) or find yourself a good Realtor, in the mean time :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;truly, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan J.
