Then join me for an easy paddle up the Merrimack river in Hooksett NH. Edgewater has one and 2 seater's from 10' to 14'. Paddles and pfd's are included.  Bring a lunch and water and we will go upstream to the park for a rest and to eat then either paddle more or float back down river. I will help those who have never been in a kayak. The boats are very stable so don't fret about tipping over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost is a low $5/hour. Plan on a few. If you already have a boat and want to come, it's only a $5 parking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come out and bring your mom and enjoy the warm weather and fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
