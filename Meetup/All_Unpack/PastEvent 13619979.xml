We will be doing this at St. Casimir's Society 28 West Street, Windsor, CT 06095 on Thursday, June 3rd at 6:45. Doors open at 6:15. Popcorn will be supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a description of what it is about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the 2007-08 presidential campaign cycle offered up the usual slate of Washington insiders, Ron Paul, an obscure Congressman from Texas brought an alternative voice that challenged the political establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advocating a philosophy of sound money, a non-interventionist foreign policy, strict Constitutionalism, and individual liberty, Dr. Paul inspired a unique grassroots movement unmatched in American history - the repercussions of which continue to reverberate today and into the future of the American psyche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty follows this historic campaign from the perspective of grassroots activists, and showcases the unique, often bizarre, yet groundbreaking projects they undertook as they brushed aside traditional campaign methodology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here is a link to a trailer for the movie.    &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emaeln--tzo" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Stienberg and I found this movie very inspiring. With the challenges that lie ahead with the coming primary's and elections, we hope this movie will inspire you as well. We have also asked Jim Azzola to come and say a few words. Jim was on the leading edge of this movement and continues on today with Campaign for Liberty and is also working on Peter Schiff's campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a friend and enjoy the show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;United We Stand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl Sargent&lt;br /&gt;CT Patriot Alliance&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275662612000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275012855000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Showing of "For Liberty" - Ron Paul Grassroots Inspired Campaign Movie</name><id>13619979</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275603300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/13619979/</event_url></item>
