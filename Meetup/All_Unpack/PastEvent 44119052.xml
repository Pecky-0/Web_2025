The more the merrier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread warmth and merriment during one of the coldest times of the year. Join us as we joyfully carol through historic streets surrounded by beautiful Victorian architecture in Providence's Armory District. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Annually, the Sunday before Christmas! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Meet up at Loie Fuller's &lt;span&gt;restaurant (1455 Westminster St) from 5-6pm before heading out at 6pm to bring holiday cheer to the neighborhood through festive holiday songs. We have planned stops with neighbors along the way for warm drinks and bathroom breaks, before ending at 8pm for milk &amp;amp; cookies at Leadership Rhode Island headquarters (1570 Westminster St) -- one block from Loie Fuller's, our original starting point. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 EVERYONE'S WELCOME regardless of any religious or non-religious beliefs. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Spread some end-of-the-year joy through song. &lt;br /&gt;

 INVITE YOUR FRIENDS &amp;amp; FAMILY! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
