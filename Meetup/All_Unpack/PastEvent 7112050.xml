<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our first meeting will be an informal coffeehouse discussion about the digital arts. This will be an opportunity to find out what topics interest everyone. We can talk about digital photography, video, great examples of art you have seen, production techniques, or anything else you want to share. The location will be the Trident Cafe on Newbury St. and I will ask them to reserve a table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the meetup, we'll have a short planning session to brainstorm ideas for future meetups and for reaching out to the digital art community in Boston. Anyone who would like to stay and participate is welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will close our first poll on Monday. Thank you everyone who voted. If you know of any other digital arts related events, please send them to me and I will add them to the group calendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you February 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll get a table and I will bring a digital media arts sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202431287000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><why>There's been a lot of interest in this group...
