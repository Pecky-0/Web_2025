 &lt;br /&gt;

 People of all ages are likely to be there...from 8 to 80.&amp;nbsp; I've been to their music/Contra dance events, the vibe is generally a bit country/hippie.&amp;nbsp; I don't expect drunken insanity, and if you're bringing alcohol, what seems to be most common at their events is wine. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 I don't know how they'll work the drumming, but if you want to join in, bring a drum or improvised percussion.&amp;nbsp; I've seen a few extra drums at the farm, but not that many. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If you're a "Maybe" please say so in your RSVP &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 HOST: Jason, cell # in my RSVP.&amp;nbsp; Texting is fine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARKING: See their website for parking info.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are driveways to dirt lots just before and just after the house, but they're not big so you may have to park along the main road.&amp;nbsp; Or park on the nearby side-street (Hatfield Hill Rd)&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332455715000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332120077000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tue. 3/20 - Free Spring Equinox bonfire, potluck dinner, drumming, singing</name><id>56891752</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332279000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/56891752/</event_url></item>
