Sometimes participants bring print-outs of articles, research, or books to share on the topic, and sometimes people just come with a story or opinion to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loosely moderate the topical discussion to give everyone a chance to participate. Then the conversation often flows onto other related subjects, sometimes in smaller conversation groups around the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas for meeting topics, please let any of the co-organizers know. We can also add announcements or "mini-topics" on the agenda if there's anything you'd like to share with the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the large group at a back table; some might be wearing atheistic shirts.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul S</member_name><member_id>4811434</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie </member_name><member_id>7248057</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303122337000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>This issue of dealing with death was discussed last month, and will be revisited briefly for those who missed it.
