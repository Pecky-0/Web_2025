&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Borderland State Park is located at 259 Massapoag Ave., North Easton, MA 02356 and is roughly a half hour ride north from the RI border just north of Route 495. It is the former estate of Oakes and Blanche Ames, and has many miles of hiking trails. For this adventure we'll be hiking about 6 1/2 miles of these trails.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pond and Quarry Hike is a roughly 6 1/2 mile hike in Borderland State Park that will have us visiting a 3 story 20 room mansion, a long abandoned quarry and many things in between. This scenic hike will bring us past a pond or two and have us crossing the streams that feed them. At the furthest end of the hike we'll stop high above Moyles Quarry and enjoy the views (maybe even have and cheese and butter sandwich!). There is a visitor center with restrooms and trail maps if you want to come back and explore the rest of the park. WIth approximately 200 feet of elevation gain, this trail is classified as moderately difficult so a good pair of hiking boots are a must. As always please bring enough water and snacks to sustain you for a 3 to 3 1/2 hour hike and please dress appropriately for the weather.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a $2 parking fee that Borderland State Park charges. The parking fee will be inserted into an automated machine so bring some $1's. This is the Park's fee, not RI Walks and Rambles' fee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
