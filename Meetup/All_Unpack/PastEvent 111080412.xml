Douglas Peary is one of the founding members of the Humanist Association of Connecticut, was its vice-president for many years and took a turn at president in 2000. Raised a conservative Baptist fundamentalist Christian on a Maine potato farm, Doug's spiritual journey led him to become an ordained UU Minister in 1979. In 2004 he published his first book, "Humanist Heroes," a compilation of his very popular presentations and hasÂ  since been working on a second volume. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 More recently, Doug has become an active advocate for Compassion &amp;amp; Choices, a group that provides education, counseling and advocacy concerning end of life choices. On Saturday, April 6, Doug will discuss details of HB 6645 - legislation currently under consideration in Connecticut that would allow terminally ill, mentally competent patients get a doctor's prescription for medication to end their suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365292267000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364268797000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conversations: HB 6645: Compassionate Aid in Dying</name><id>111080412</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365273000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/111080412/</event_url></item>
