Meet in Striker's Pub (inside the bowling alley) area at 8:15. &lt;br /&gt;This is run just like the trivia night at Bayside in Fairhaven. Trivia Buff includes 4 &amp;quot;semesters,&amp;quot; each with 4 questions that you allocate a number of points to. There is also a 'name-that-tune' portion as well as additional bonus questions. Categories range from movies to sports to science. &lt;br /&gt;There can be up to 6 people on a team. Depending on how many people show up we will make multiple teams. &lt;br /&gt;Striker's Pub has a full bar and reasonable drink prices. I am not sure if there will be food; I think that the kitchen is closed by that hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send out my cell phone number the day of the event, just in case. Hope to see you there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for the group in Striker's Pub</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293146521000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291390660000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia at Wonderbowl (in Striker's Pub)</name><id>15631206</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292807700000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/15631206/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
