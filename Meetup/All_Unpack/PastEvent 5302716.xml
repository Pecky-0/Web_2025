In total, an estimated $375 in cash, gift cards and merchandise was donated.  For those of you who did not donate, you can still do so up until December 17 at the DoggieDay Play Center.  I will keep you posted on the outcome of the contest as it comes to a close. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please remember to RSVP accordingly for meet-ups.  It is a free, indoor venue and we need to plan ahead with staff to accommodate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, have a safe and happy Holiday season and we'll see you on January 6, 2007! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS..Please, check out the meet-up organizer of the week.  You can also post comments if you wish.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2407140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168437161000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Pug Devotee Extraordinaires</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-73</urlname><id>126274</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>47</yes_rsvp_count><created>1165075742000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Pug January Meetup</name><id>5302716</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168095600000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-73/events/5302716/</event_url></item>
