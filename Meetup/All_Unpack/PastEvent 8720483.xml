Over the past two decades we have gained a much deeper understanding of the true nature of the heart, which is the first organ to form in the body.  The heart contains extensive brain-like neural matter and sends electromagnetic and chemical information to balance and regulate the rest of the body.  This &amp;quot;heartpower&amp;quot; can be harnessed for healing at emotional, physical and spiritual levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of each meeting, we have a chance to get to know one another and our professional specialties. We share a potluck lunch, and then have a featured presenter share about his/her work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know what you will bring for the potluck lunch when you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will welcome you when you arrive!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226679789000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220959201000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies October Meetup</name><id>8720483</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223652600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/8720483/</event_url></item>
