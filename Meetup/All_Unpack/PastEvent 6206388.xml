You wont win any prizes, but you might get your 15 seconds of fame and the respect of your peers.  It's just a fun, friendly group of folks who get together every Friday night and get to know each other and show off their caboodle of useless information.  The fun starts at 9:00, so head on over to the bar and look for Ray.  He'll be there by 8:00 ready for a challenge.  This isn't an official meetup, so you can either email Ray and let him know you're coming or else just show up.  You can check out this &lt;a href="http://the99.know-where.com/the99/cgi/site?site=081&amp;amp;address=%3a%3aSomerville%3a%3aMA%3a%3a&amp;amp;design=default&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;option=&amp;amp;mapid=US" target="_blank"&gt;99 website&lt;/a&gt; for directions, but it's very easy to get to and parking is free and easy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;debbie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188778118000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187527725000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia night at the 99 Restaurant</name><id>6206388</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188604800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6206388/</event_url></item>
