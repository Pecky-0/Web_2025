We will just be taking a leisure walk around the pond on the walking path.  Please come a few minutes early to meet and greet if you would like, and we will get started on the walk at 7:00.  Look for us in the parking area nearest the pond.  There is a &amp;quot;house&amp;quot; used in the winter for warming up during ice skating.  You probably won't be able to miss us!  If you are a few minutes late, we will be going counter clockwise on the path around the pond. Don't be shy to catch up.  Look for cancellations on the website, but barring unsafe weather, we'll be there!  Please email with any questions!  Hope to see you there&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Me and Izzy (rottie) will be waiting by the boathouse</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>melissa </member_name><member_id>7279035</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217721901000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217440819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dorrs Pond, Manchester</name><id>8442181</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217548800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/8442181/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/4/global_4216148.jpeg</photo_url></item>
