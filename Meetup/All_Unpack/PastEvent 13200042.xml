Lets meet up at 6:30 and head in at 6:45 to get seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the movie is showing upstairs I will try to snag a table near the windows at the top of the escalator.   If it is downstairs I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.   I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before going into the theater and don't see us inside, we will gather outside in the hallway for a bit and to discuss the movie and get a head count of everyone who would like to go out for drinks and munchies after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailer for this looked like quite a hoot.  Bad one liners and explosions....sounds like my kind of fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the movie is &amp;quot;The Losers&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: April 23, 2010 &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Warner Bros.
