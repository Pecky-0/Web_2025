I want to setup a meetup after the show at a restaurant or bar in the area. I don't know too much about the Northeastern or MFA area so if anyone has any recommendations - that would be great. The show starts at 7:30 and will probably be over around 10.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the show is sold out, so hopefully you already have your tickets.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren't familiar with the Moutain Goats, visit their myspace page and listen to a few songs - perhaps you can convince someone on craigslist to sell their ticket.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/11734232" target="_blank"&gt;Moutain Goats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to meetup before or after the show - RSVP and give me a call - (701) 331-0920 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you at the MFA on the 15th.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://livemusic.meetup.com/81/pages/About_this_Meetup_Group/"&gt;About this Meetup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Give me a call and I'll give you our location</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Moeri</member_name><member_id>4913745</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205710594000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Get to know other Moutain Goat fans in Boston - How often does that happen?</why><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202962400000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Moutain Goats - MFA - March 14th</name><id>7328753</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205537400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/7328753/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/5/global_3222901.jpeg</photo_url></item>
