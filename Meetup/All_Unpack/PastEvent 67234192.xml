&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and events in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The American at the The Locomotive Works! This is the new place where Everyman "used" to be for those that remember.... and, yeah, that makes you an official Rhode Islander ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we were at Everyman a few Super Bowls ago and it was good. For those that thought "This is an awesome space, but it could use some sprucing up", this is for you! The folks from the Abbey opened The American a few months ago, and the reviews are in. I have it from several good (and food-snob) authorities that the drinks and food are both fabulous, so let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels the Monday Night Meetup. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
