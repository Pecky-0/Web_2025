<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This worked last time so we're going for it again.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EACH OF US IS GOING TO BRING THREE $20 BILLS. At the beginning of the night you will pass it off to a wingman. For every set you open, you get $20 back. YOU WILL OPEN 3 SETS BY THE END OF THE NIGHT! We will all mostly likely get a number close by the third set. If not, your AA should be gone by the last one to continue on and get a # close by the end of the night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've done this before with wings and it works awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure we'll meet up at Margaritas in East Hartford. We'll figure out what bar to hit up first and jump right on the highway to head up there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you havent gone to a meeting yet: we're gonna pick out a corner of the bar area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in the Bar area</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282027955000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>You don't learn getting better with woman from a book.
