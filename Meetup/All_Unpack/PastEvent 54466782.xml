Guess What??? St. Patricks Day is on a Sat. this year, do you beleive that?? Well, if you want to have what will surely begora a rocking good time, than let's meet up at the Point St. Piano Bar in beutiful Prov. R.I.! The time is set for 730pm,somemembers of this group went there around a month ago, and I think most people had a good time, so me thinkin' is St. Pats Day should be a gas!!&amp;nbsp; So if you haven't made plans to passout somewhere else that night,plan on meeting up at this piano bar&amp;nbsp;with this group . I need to know closer to the 17th&amp;nbsp; if you're going to make reservations, so keep me posted, hope to meet alot of you there!
