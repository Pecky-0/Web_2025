However, since none of the people recommending were there, we were unable to vote on the one that would best follow. The inchoate sequence of book selections varies from light read to a more thought provoking selection. The selection for the month of July would have to be thought provoking. Note having the recommenders there to elucidate on the theme of the recommendations, we had to make another selection from a new member who joined in at the last moment of the last meeting. THEREFORE, &amp;#61514; The selection of the month is: Thomas Hardy&amp;#146;s &amp;#147;Far from the Madding Crowd&amp;#148;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Claudia Max</member_name><member_id>3454059</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1311172997000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Open Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>redbookclub-1005</urlname><id>594346</id><group_lat>41.7999992371</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309216333000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>July "Classic" </name><id>23735511</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1311116400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/redbookclub-1005/events/23735511/</event_url></item>
