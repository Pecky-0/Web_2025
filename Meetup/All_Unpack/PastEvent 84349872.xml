The fun continues Mondays at Battery Park! Every Monday at 7:00pm join us and Geeks Who Drink &lt;a href="http://geekswhodrink.com/518/"&gt;http://geekswhodrink.com/518/&lt;/a&gt; for an exciting game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiz consists of 8 rounds of 8 questions and includes a picture round, music round, and chances for FREE BEER!  Last week, Team "The Replacement Refs" took the win after holding a 2nd place score throughout the game! YAY! We beat the Toby Flendersons! I should be there by 6:30pm and will try to reserve us a couple of tables. FREE APPETIZERS while they last! Come early to get a good seat and a good team. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park is conveniently located in the Financial District near State Street (Orange and Blue Line), Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red Lines), and a short walk to Park Street (Red and Green Lines).  Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink.  PLEASE PAY AS YOU GO OR MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB.  You can view Battery Park's menu here: &lt;a href="http://www.batteryparkboston.com/"&gt;http://www.batteryparkboston.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
