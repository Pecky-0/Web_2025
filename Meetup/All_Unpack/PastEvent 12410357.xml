We will walk the mall and then, if anyone is interested, settle in at the Food Court for a little while to plan future meetups, chat more, and possibly indulging in a beverage or food.  If we walk the nooks and crannies of the mall, it is one mile.  However, we have generally been walking more of the general area of the mall, which is closer to 3/4 of a mile.  The walk will last about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how long we decide we want to walk.  Plan to join us for an hour if you only plan to walk, or about 1&amp;amp;1/2 hours if you plan to join us in the Food Court after our walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For our first Mall Walk of the New Year, this will be our &amp;quot;game plan.&amp;quot;  We will walk the first floor first and then go upstairs to walk the second floor which is carpeted.  We will plan to walk together the first lap and then we can break up into smaller groups depending on our paces.  The first floor we will walk a casual leisurely pace.  When we head upstairs we will pick-up the pace.  The final lap should be at a casual leisurely pace.  We will lead the way so you can learn the walking route.  Shortly after we begin our walk we may stop to do some stretching exercises in a less-populated area of the mall (so as not to draw too much attention to ourselves) so we keep injuries to a minimum.  Before we head upstairs we can gather our coats and leave them on a bench upstairs (probably near Macy's) if the Group so desires.  Otherwise, we can leave them on a bench/couch/chair near the Customer Service Desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday Evening Walk at the Mall&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, February 3rd, 2010 @ 5pm&lt;br /&gt;South Shore Plaza&lt;br /&gt;250 Granite Street&lt;br /&gt;(Route 37)&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184&lt;br /&gt;781-843-8200&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Place: Meet near the near the seating area near the Customer Service Booth and Elevator on the first floor near Victoria's Secret and Cache.  We will wait 5-10 minutes for latecomers.  We will also pass by the area twice before we head upstairs so if you see a pile of jackets hang our near them and we'll meet you then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re-Group: After walking, if anyone desires, we will re-group in the Food Court on the 2nd floor (above the Main Entrance) where we can grab a bite to eat or something to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer(s): Angela &amp;amp; Alison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fees: Organizer Team Members and Annual Group Members: Free, Group Members and Guests: $2pp ~ Cost to become a 2010 Annual Member at this event is $11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max/Min:  There is no minimum as the Event Organizers are planning to walk either way.  No maximum!  The more the merrier! Guests welcome.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: 2pm on Wednesday, February 2nd.  Please see the SSFMG's No-Show policy on the About page for more info about why it is important to update your RSVP by this Deadline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: This will be updated the weekend before the event.  Please plan to attend unless you hear from us otherwise.  Please see the SSFMG Weather Policy on the About page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Note About Jackets: While there is no formal coat area, we will be walking before the Mall opens and as many walkers do, we can leave our coats on one of the benches.  Since there will mostly be Mall Walkers chances are pretty good that our coats will be fine.  I've never heard of a stolen coat while someone was Mall Walking.  (We will pass by the bench once or twice on the first level and then we will be able to see it from the 2nd level 2 or 3 times.)  I would suggest leaving the mink at home.  **This Walk will be during normal Mall Hours.  The coats should still be safe.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Located at 250 Granite Street/Route 37 in Braintree.  &lt;br /&gt;Exit 6 off Route 93.  &lt;br /&gt;Take a right off the Exit.  &lt;br /&gt;There are entrances to the Mall at 3 lights.  &lt;br /&gt;Enter the Mall through one of the Main Entrances.
