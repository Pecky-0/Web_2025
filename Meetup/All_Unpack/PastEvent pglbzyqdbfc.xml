&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month's topic is "What's in your Camera Bag?" Pick one of your bags and load it up with all your cool stuff and bring it along to the meeting. We will share our bags and show off what our favorite things are. Roy is going to chit chat for a few mins about lenses and how they are built and used and just why they are so darn cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also going to have a special dust bunny eliminator with us this evening. That's right folks Shawn will be back and doing sensor cleanings. If you have a camera with any icky little friends clinging to your sensor- its time to eradicate them. Shawn is a pro a this and only charges 35.00 per camera. First come first served. And we need a min of 5 cameras to get him to come out. At the last meeting we had 4-5 commitments- so we are good...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know the Details....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting Begins at 7:30PM the Last Thursday of every month. So from 7:30 to 8:00 will be open and social! Hanging out chit chatting will be encouraged! The from 8:00 to 9:00 we will have a more organized agenda. A topic, a presentation, a group sharing of images, something related to Photography! Then from 9 to 9:30 We will hang out again catching up with folks from that evenings topic. We'll clean up and head out by 9:45.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward we will be asking for a donation at the meetups of $5.00 to cover costs. However it's not mandatory to attend - just please donate if you can...&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/1723755200050492932723/img/smileys/biggrin.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
