The &lt;i&gt;simpatica&lt;/i&gt; owner's Italian grandmother was &amp;quot;Jessie&amp;quot;.  Inside, you'll find comfortable seating area and a casual-elegant atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have desserts, gelato, coffee, tea and martinis (!).  They do not, however, have sandwiches or other &amp;quot;lunch type&amp;quot; food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we suggest having a big breakfast or an early lunch before or a late lunch after at one of Federal Hill's fine dining establishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is never an obligation to purchase anything when you attend one of our events.  We do want to make a &lt;i&gt;bella figura&lt;/i&gt;, though, so please order at least a beverage!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Listen for Italian speakers and look for Italian dictionaries!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dawn Alba</member_name><member_id>170502</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248997551000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Italian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>italian-420</urlname><id>447590</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Italian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246909078000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Italian Conversation on The Hill</name><id>10814766</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247932800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-420/events/10814766/</event_url></item>
