From the &lt;a href="http://www.newportevents.com/Blackships/main.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Black Ships Festival commemorates the historic achievements of Commodore Matthew C. Perry, USN, of Newport, Rhode Island. The “Black Ships,” or “Kurofune,” refers to the Japanese term for foreign ships which, with one exception, were excluded from Japan for two hundred years until 1854. Commodore Perry negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, the first treaty between the United States and Japan, thus ending two centuries of Japanese isolationism. The Black Ships Festival celebrates the signing of the treaty, which brought the two countries together as trading partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Black Ships Festivals in Newport and in its Japanese Sister City Shimoda, commemorate this historic event with a celebration of friendship. This year also celebrates the 52nd anniversary of the Sister City relationship between Newport and Shimoda, Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one of the many things going on as part of the festival, but of the most interest to me.  After the performance, get lunch and Ice Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taiko Drum Festival&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11:00AM • CARDINE'S FIELD&lt;br /&gt;Taiko Drum Festival with Odaiko New England, one of the premier Taiko groups of New England, will dazzle you with their electrifying drums. The taiko is said to be the voice and spirit of the Japanese. The sound of the taiko has an irresistible draw that summons people to seek out its source! They'll mesmerize listeners with their speed, power, dramatic choreography and sound. Don't miss this amazing group! Tickets $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are attending, you are responsible for purchasing your own ticket.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be near the entrance with a Newcomers Meetup sign at 10:30.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279467776000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278258892000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Newport Black Ship Festival - Taiko Drum Festival</name><id>13998915</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279463400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/13998915/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
