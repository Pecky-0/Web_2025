Genevieve will be sharing a discussion centered on her youthful experience of sailing 18' Micro-mini-yacht "Pere Peinard" from Miami to Australia, with her fellow dreamer, Claude Desjardins, two tuxedo cats, and lots of heart. This voyage spun out over the years 1983-1986, at a time when there was only one satellite in the sky. Genevieve will have us speculating on the spiritual/psychological meaning of solitude, now that none of us can escape the impact of GPS and electronic connectivity. By virtue of the shortness of waterline, speeds and distances covered, Historian William Longyard includes mention of "Pere Peinard" in his book "Speck on the Sea: Epic Voyages of Improbable Vessels". However, Genevieve feels that "On the ocean, all boats are small! Their trip followed the wake of the great ship, the QE2, traversing the Panama Canal, and Neptune smiled equally upon everyone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genevieve Jacobs is a lifelong cruising sailor, currently living ashore in Burlington, Vermont, where she teaches college, practices psychotherapy, and enjoys freshwater sailing on Lake Champlain.&lt;/p&gt;
