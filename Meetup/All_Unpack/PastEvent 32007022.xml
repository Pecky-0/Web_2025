<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Situated on 24 acres of woods and meadows in central Massachusetts, Cornerstone Ranch allows riders to savor the colors and smells of New England with a two-hour guided trail ride led by farm owner Sue Connell. From the commanding view afforded by long-legged steeds, riders journey along the meandering trails traversing the ranch, taking in sweeping pastures and dense foliage while receiving instruction on mare-maneuvering basics from the guide and the guide's talking horse. Cornerstone Ranch houses an assortment of safe, tranquil horses fit for riders of any age, experience level, or cowboy-hat fluid capacity. Please note that the weight limit for their trail rides is 260 lbs and is limited to one rider per horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trail ride is approximately two hours long and costs $70 per person (unless you have a Groupon that will cut that price in half to $35.)&amp;nbsp; Typical trail ride gratuity is 15%. For the Groupon, go to:

&lt;p&gt;Also since we will be finishing around lunch time maybe we can stop in a local restaurant on the way back. Please let me know if you are interested in lunch also and I'll search for a nice restaurant we can go to.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at ranch.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam</member_name><member_id>8861556</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>11</waitlist_count><updated>1320191063000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1314977584000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Horseback Riding</name><id>32007022</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319898600000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/32007022/</event_url></item>
