As the author of Known and Unknown, Mr. Rumsfeld not only chronicles his life as a public servant, but provides insight into previously undisclosed details of the United States government that few Americans can offer. At the end of the event, attendees will have the chance to participate in a question and answer session with Mr. Rumsfeld.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317260653000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1312397283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Evening with Rumsfeld hosted by WRKO talking about 9/11-tix $50</name><id>28131711</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317078000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/28131711/</event_url></item>
