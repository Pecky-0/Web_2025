&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/"&gt;IMBD Description&lt;/a&gt;: A paranoid mathematician searches for a key number that will unlock the universal patterns found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directed and Written by: Darren Aronofsky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staring: Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Ben Shenkman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Ebert gave this film 3.5 Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;WARNING!!!! :&lt;/span&gt; If you do not like to think about films on deeper levels and or have problems with Black and White, then DO NOT attend this film.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;AJ's Comments:&amp;nbsp; This was Darren Aronofsky's first full length film that received many nominations at several Independent Film Festivals, including a special recognition in Directing at "Sundance".&amp;nbsp; People in general&amp;nbsp;absolutely hate it or absolutely LOVE it, most often&amp;nbsp;correlating with&amp;nbsp;thier views on Independent Film in general. &amp;nbsp;The budget (I kid you not) &lt;strong&gt;was $60,000 for this entire film, which grossed over $3,200,000 in the US in 1998.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;That was not a typo&lt;/em&gt;, I only wish I could get that kind of return on my investments.&amp;nbsp; While I'd like to think it was partially a stylistic choice, the film was shot almost entirely in Black and White to aid in Budget, and it is the first appearance of some of Aronofsky's innovative stylistic camera and sound techniques.&amp;nbsp; The film deals with themes related to Obsession, especially when it comes to finding Religious Beliefs and meaning in patterns and the natural world around us.&amp;nbsp; The main character obsesively works to design computer programs to attempt to derive a patern in the natural order of things in the world, and is thought close enough that he is sought after by Wall street firms and a group of Jewish Scholars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1b29"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event start time is 7:00 for the social portion, so you can start showing up then &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;but please no earlier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We will not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;start the film until 7:30 or shortly there after&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but don't plan to be any later.&amp;nbsp; (There are now restrictions on room time.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #3f57a4"&gt;Feel free to use the waiting list. If someone else backs out you can be automatically added, just provide your full&amp;nbsp;name for the concierge as a contingency.&amp;nbsp; (I recommend RSVPing individually rather than using +1's if wait-listing.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Snacks:&lt;/span&gt; Bring your own Snacks and Beverages. (Just Please be careful and responsible.) Sharing is encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Getting in:&lt;/span&gt; Enter the building through the State Street Entrance (Between the intersections of State with Court and Chapel) and talk to the Concierge, there are &lt;span&gt;instructions with a phone number on the door and&lt;/span&gt; a call box with bell button. If you really have trouble, pre-movie-start time you can call/text AJ at 315-345-9348&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Parking:&lt;/span&gt; There is metered street parking available near by on Orange Street and Court Street (some with Credit Card slot available.), obey the posted limits on the meter.&amp;nbsp; If you don't mind the longer walk, some of the Yale Lots are free in the evening/weekends. (I.E. Yale lot 51 on Temple Street.) 360's Parking Garage is open to visitors for Credit Card Customers only, the entrance is on State Street just to the Right of the buildings main entrance. Other local near by businesses may have open parking, however you're on your own there. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't think I really need to say this, but: This is basically an extension of my home I'm inviting you into, there for I expect everyone will treat it with respect and not risk future events (or my lease).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ring the Bell Button or Call the concierge on the cell phone number on the door, they will Direct you.
