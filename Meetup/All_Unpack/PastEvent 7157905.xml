This is the start up meetup for the Brunch Bunch group!  I am starting this group because several people in my Friday night dinner group expressed an interest in brunch.  In order to avoid confusion, I decided to start this group up and have a single focus for each group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Cafe Paragon as our first location as it is fairly centrally located in Providence and they have a really nice buffet that seemed reasonably priced.  The brunch runs from 10-2 on Sundays and is $13.99 without alcohol or $17.99 with a bloody mary or mimosa.  See their website &lt;a href="http://Paragon Cafe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paragonandviva.com/#brunch" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.paragonand...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   for the brunch menu and pictures of their location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am making a reservation for 12 people, so that will be the maximum number of people to RSVP.  In addition, I am eliminating maybe responses in order to allow those who really want to attend to get a spot.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to help defray the cost of hosting a group on meetup, I would like to ask all members who attend meetups to contribute a dollar at alternating events.  There will be no real tracking of this, but it would just be a good will donation to help me out.  Thanks all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is going to be fun and I look forward to meeting everyone.  Yay brunch!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am, plus sized, 5'2', with shoulder length red hair and glasses with dark rims.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202829579000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>You will get good food and great conversation with people who have similar interests(well at least in brunch anyway)...</why><group><who>Friends who brunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Brunch-Bunch</urlname><id>964634</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch !</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200854677000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch!
