Anyone who's been there before knows you need to get there early. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can meet at the field closest to the conference center parking lot. You can bring coolers, snacks, chairs and bug spray. They also have food trucks nearby. For all of those with children the carnival is also going on at St John's. It's a great event and a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve C</member_name><member_id>6197158</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247009638000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
