I am looking forward to meeting all of you and I want to invite you to get together the last sunday in September at 2 pm.   The ongoing class on sundays at 11:30 still exists so if you interested please email me. But as far as this group is concerned, I would like to meet the last Sunday of every month at 2pm. Please let me know if another time works better.  We will start with a guided meditation and then each month there will be a different topic to discuss, explore and Experience. Topics will include: Light, Love, Blessings, Prayer, Lives of the Saints, devotion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Light, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540480000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156556840000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Christian Mystic Meet up!</name><id>5097518</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1159120800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/5097518/</event_url></item>
