Event will be held in Underbones from 5pm to 7pm. 15 different draft brews from Bear, plus one cask. This is an incredible lineup. And, yes, free apps as well. Meet the brewer! Beers available throughout the night in both up and down bars, while they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hungry after?&lt;br /&gt;Redbones recently won the Phoenix Best of 2009 Readers' Pick Award for Barbecue. So, yeah. Chow down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: This is a FYI event. Meaning, it's not your typical Craft Beer Crew meet-up; though because it's so cool, I couldn't resist putting it on the calendar for you all to know about. So, feel free to attend with friends, look for other members going AND - most of all - have fun! (And if you have an event to add to the FYI calendar, please let me know!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alicia</member_name><member_id>8353321</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249155037000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>beer buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CraftBeerCrew</urlname><id>1469154</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Craft Beer Crew</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246386339000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FYI: Bear Republic Keg Party</name><id>10770973</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248901200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CraftBeerCrew/events/10770973/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/d/global_9049101.jpeg</photo_url></item>
