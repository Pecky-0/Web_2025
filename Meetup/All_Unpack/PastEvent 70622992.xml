Old skool hip hop and R&amp;amp;B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped in here this past Sunday and the music was awesome! The patio is a good size space and almost empty!! Plenty o' room to party and socialize, etc.  We had a great time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park is located in the Financial District in Boston.  It's near State St (Orange and Blue Lines), Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red) and a short walk to Park Street or Gov't Ctr (Green Line).  Street parking is available and FREE on Sundays in Boston.  There are also a couple of pay garages nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. SO PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take over this patio! Good eats, good music, and good friends! COME ON DOWN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=========================================&lt;/p&gt;
