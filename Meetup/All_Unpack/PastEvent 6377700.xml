This is easy walking distance to the PNI club where the dinner will be held. ?--- Dinner starts at 7:00 at the PNI Club at 290 Millbury Street in Worcester.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The fundraiser will feature a GREAT catered dinner from Zimmy's kitchen, live entertainment, a few guest speakers, door prizes and a more! All this for only $25, of which 100% will go to Ron Paul's campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are expecting to fill the place which holds 300 people and tickets are for sale now. We are notifying the media and finalizing all the last minute details. I will update as we have more information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great opportunity to &amp;quot;rally the troops&amp;quot; in a fun, and entertaining environment that is sure to attract alot of publicity and motivate others to join the campaign.
