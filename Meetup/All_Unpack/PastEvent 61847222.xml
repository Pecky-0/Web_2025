&lt;p&gt;The talk of this year’s Sundance comes to Boston as the festival’s closing-night offering. Lauren Greenfield’s acridly observed documentary follows the ups and downs of David and Jackie Siegel as they try to build the largest residential home in America before the recession comes along to bite them on the tuchis. When the film opens, the Siegels are living a life of pornographic opulence, with seven children, countless lapdogs, and a life of excess that would turn Glenn Beck communist. Then the crunch comes; the scene where Jackie rents a car at the airport and asks where the driver is makes for uproarious parvenu comedy. But she’s also an unexpectedly moving stand-in for the American consumer at his or her most psychologically desperate. It’s a troubling, eye-opening movie that, unfortunately, ends before the story does. (May 2, 8 p.m., Coolidge Corner).&lt;/p&gt;
