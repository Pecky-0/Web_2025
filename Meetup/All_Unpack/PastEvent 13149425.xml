The funds raised will go toward the&lt;br /&gt;Home Base Program, a philanthropic partnership that is dedicated to&lt;br /&gt;improving the lives of New England servicemen and women returning home&lt;br /&gt;with combat stress disorders through clinical care, innovative research,&lt;br /&gt;education, family support, and community outreach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cause means a lot to me; a friend from college served two one-year&lt;br /&gt;tours of Iraq. Through him, I've had the honor to have met several Army&lt;br /&gt;men and women that willingly signed up to fight overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can learn more about the race on the website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.runtohomebase.org/" target="_blank"&gt;OFFICIAL WEBSITE HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've donated $25 to this worthy cause, and I'm asking for your help in&lt;br /&gt;raising funds.
