This movie is such a classic, I thought people in both groups might want to see it, as we did with &amp;quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinema City is doing a series of classic movies on Saturdays and Sundays at 11:00am. &lt;span style="color: green"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALL TICKETS ARE ONLY $5 ($4 if you are a Criterion Club member).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  I am going to schedule meetups for all of them even if I cannot attend, to let people know about them.  But I definitely plan to make this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who has not heard of this film? &amp;quot;George Bailey is a small-town man whose life seems so desperate he contemplates suicide. He had always wanted to leave Bedford Falls to see the world, but circumstances and his own good heart have led him to stay. He sacrificed his education for his brother's, kept the family-run savings and loan afloat, protected the town from the avarice of the greedy banker Mr. Potter, and married his childhood sweetheart. As he prepares to jump from a bridge, his guardian angel intercedes; showing him what life would have become for the residents of Bedford Falls is he had never lived.&amp;quot; With classic performances by Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers.  130 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm a short brunette who will be wearing a sweatshirt with a surfing snowman on it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292840643000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292176750000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"It's a Wonderful Life" - Cine Classics at Cinema City at the Palace </name><id>15712501</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292773500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/15712501/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/8/global_5165560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
