&lt;p&gt;We won't be reserving a specific picnic table area but there is so much room.  There were table areas available today and it was quite busy.  Worst case scenario, we can set up anywhere in the open park!  We'll have to have some colorful balloons to help people find us when we arrive and figure out where to set up.  I will also update the meetup page and provide my cell #.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you RSVP, please post what you will be bringing!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be great to have a portable grill or two if possible. Any foods and beverages to share will be great.  They have a no alcohol policy, so do what you want to do, but I did my job by posting it.  Ha ha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking is $15 but well worth it, I think, for this beautiful location!  You can also carpool!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melody Joy Gaeta, Realtor</member_name><member_id>3036353</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343648881000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342996312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oceanside picnic/cookout/beach day at beautiful Stage Fort Park in Gloucester!</name><id>74455822</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1343581200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/74455822/</event_url></item>
