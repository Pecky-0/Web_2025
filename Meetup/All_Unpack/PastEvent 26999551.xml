&lt;p&gt;We will meet at&amp;nbsp;9:30 am at the Newton Boat house, do the paper work for rentals and be on the water by 10.00. This is also a scenic stretch of flat water with lots of wildlife along the river, you may bring your camera, but keep it safe from water.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;There is rental charge for the kayaks/canoes. We will plan to do about 2 hours, so if renting solo, it would be around $30.00pp, dual/shared ones would be 18.00pp.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Do bring your license/ID, bottle(s) of water, suntan lotion / hat. After the trip, we&amp;nbsp;may stop at newton for sandwich/lunch.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;There is a parking lot little further from the boathouse, it is little tricky to find out, you may stop at the boathouse to get directions or call me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain cancels.&amp;#65279;&lt;/p&gt;
