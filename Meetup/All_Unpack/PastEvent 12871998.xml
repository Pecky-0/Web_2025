What do you say we join in on this event,  Sounds like a  good cause and with a bonus of flying and food who could go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;... The state of VT has been working diligently to close a Montpelier airport favorite, Sambel's restaurant. It is conveniently located right on the field within the terminal building and is operated by the friendliest restaurateurs you will ever meet. Brenda and Bob Sambel are VERY pilot-friendly, willing to open the restaurant for us outside of their normal business hours when they know pilots are coming. Apparently, the state has alternative plans for this building and they are pressuring Sambel's with political and governmental tactics, despite the fact that Sambel's has a lease and are abiding by every word of it....&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;   NEPG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the informative write up done by the  NE Pilots group info here:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NEPilotsGroup/calendar/12827313/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plan for a wheel up out of Kfit at 11AM,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lets meet at Charlie's hanger for a short pilot brief before departure.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Bortle</member_name><member_id>6715847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270522343000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268571638000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Airport Restaurant Rally!!!
