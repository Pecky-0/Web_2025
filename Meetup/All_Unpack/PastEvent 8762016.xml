October lends itself to some of the best hiking, with blue skies, crispy clean weather, and hopefully some autumn color! Let's partake in a fun, invigorating, Saturday morning hike to christen the fall.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This first Meetup will be at Sleeping Giant, which is a Connecticut State Park located in Hamden.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN: Sleeping Giant is a great park for any level of hiking, but we'd like to try a modest trail for the first Meetup. The &amp;quot;castle trail&amp;quot; is relatively short, has a mild incline, and requires little maneuvering over rocky places - the trail consists of a wide gravel road.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the entrance, which is located on Mt. Carmel Avenue, between 7:45 and 8, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by 8:15. This particular hike shouldn't take more than 2.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: water! (And a snack if you like.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please see link below. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is no fee for parking in the lot after Labor Day.  However, if the lot is full (probably not, at 8 a.m.), please take advantage of the street parking on Mt. Carmel Avenue adjacent to park, ACROSS FROM (not inside) Quinnipiac University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to park website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/Dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325264" target="_blank"&gt;Sleeping Giant State Park Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer (Sarah) will be wearing a blue and red rugby shirt and green cap.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>22</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225590871000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>13</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221500214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Early-bird Hiking October Meetup</name><id>8762016</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223726400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/8762016/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/5/global_5551989.jpeg</photo_url></item>
