Spring is officially rocking and rolling! Let's get out and enjoy the show while we burn off some winter calories in the company of friends.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at Sleeping Giant, which is a Connecticut State Park located in Hamden.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN: Sleeping Giant is a great park for any level of hiking.  We'd like to walk the tower trail, which is relatively short, has a mild incline, and requires very little maneuvering over rocky places.  We will have a break at the tower for snacks and chit chat, and we can split up into two groups after our break -- some members walking back down the tower road, and other members heading down the blue trail, if they desire a greater challenge. The two groups can converge at the parking lot after the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the entrance, which is located on Mt. Carmel Avenue, between 11:45 and noon, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by five minutes after 12. This particular hike shouldn't take more than 2 hours, with the break, and will be energizing without exhausting us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: water and a snack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads;  layers of clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website. Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please see link below. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: The DEP sometimes charges a fee to park in the lot.  Please take advantage of the street parking on Mt. Carmel Avenue, adjacent to park, ACROSS FROM (not inside) Quinnipiac University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to park website (with map):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/Dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325264" target="_blank"&gt;Sleeping Giant State Park Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail maps are usually available at the entrance, if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer (Sarah) will be wearing red</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239559705000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238689772000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Early-bird Hiking Last-Minute Make-up Meetup</name><id>10098204</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238860800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/10098204/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/2/global_7947170.jpeg</photo_url></item>
