Breanna Perry will be coming up from Philly to delight us with her DJing, and she&amp;#146;ll be joined by Boston&amp;#146;s own Micki Balder. Whether you prefer the Count, or the Duke, if you like the music of the swing era, you will like what Breanna plays. Old favorites such as Louis Armstrong and Jimmie Lunceford fit right into her sets, next to more contemporary artists like Tuba Skinny or the Boilermaker Jazz Band. Big bands, small groups, New Orleans jazz, even some of the stuff from the late 40&amp;amp;prime;s and 50&amp;amp;prime;s with that bop tint to it&amp;#150;if it will get dancer feet moving, there&amp;#146;s a chance you will hear her play it. All Breanna wants is to help you enjoy dancing as much as possible, and at least as much as she does! Performance by Breanna Perry! Sweet treats by Tina Desorcy!
