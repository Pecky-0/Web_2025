It's been a couple years since we've last played here, we're usually at their sister venue across the street...we decided to try something different, do a little more intimate show in a restaurant type setting.  The Stonebridge is well known for their great food, serving a nice mix of classic American seafood and steak dishes in an upscale atmosphere...later in the evening the vibe does get quite a bit more lively...great place for a night out, nice dinner and some dancing to some good 'ol school grooves!!!  Showtime kicks off at 9:30...reservations recommended if you hope to get a table, in the past we've really packed them in here!
