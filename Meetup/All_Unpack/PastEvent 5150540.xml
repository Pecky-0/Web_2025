Should be a great venue to meet new faces and chill out.  And we'll follow that up with dancing at Gypsy Bar, which has one of the best international clubbing scenes in the city.  Hope to see everybody this Sat. night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plan: Meet at 8pm at Excelsior (272 Boylston St, next to the Four Seasons hotel).  We will meet inside the bar before heading over to Gypsy Bar around 9pm. Please try to meet us at Excelsior as Gypsy Bar WILL BE CROWDED and finding new faces becomes difficult.  There is NO COVER at Gypsy until 10pm ($10), but a long line will start forming shortly after 9:15pm, so even more reason to meet with the group early.  Give me a call if you need help with directions or finding the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picture is on this site, when you see the group, just introduce yourself and say you are a friend of Charlie. If your picture is up on the site, do RVSP and I'll look for you as well. My phone is 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excelsior and Gypsy are upscale scenes, so please dress appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
