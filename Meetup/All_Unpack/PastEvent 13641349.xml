I hope most of you can make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather is getting warmer.  Let’s go and see some water falling.  Chapman Falls drops 60 feet over rocks with strange pot holes.  Could this be the work of the Prince of Darkness?  Come and find out.  We can also enjoy the coolness of the Eight Mile River as it flows through the valley.  Our walk will be to the vista overlooking the farming lands in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 2 miles with some hills to climb.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  I have not visited this place in a few years, and I will be following the trail map.  Afterwards we will have a picnic lunch at the base of the falls.  The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  (approximate address of main entrance, no mailbox there) 318 Hopyard Rd, East Haddam, CT.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>34</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281188836000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>38</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275255264000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Devil’s Hopyard State Park Walk, East Haddam, CT</name><id>13641349</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280584800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/13641349/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
