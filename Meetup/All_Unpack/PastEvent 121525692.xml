&lt;p&gt;Wickaboxet Wildlife Management Area was used years ago for picnics and outdoor recreation.  That was before a devastating fire in the '50's turned the place into brush fields and brambles. Now it is a lightly used WMA, which is becoming a forest again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/6/4/event_240857252.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wickaboxet Management Area was the first state forest. At 679 acres in West Greenwich just south of the Coventry line, it was later over shadowed by the much larger Arcadia Management Area. This is a short 2 1/2 mile hike, but it is a scenic walk in an interesting area with a nice vantage point atop the Rattlesnake Ledge. This hike should take about 1 1/4 hours. It is mostly flat with some small hills, except for the short climb to the top of Rattlesnake Ledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that while we are doing the Wickaboxet hike, we are parking at Tillinghast Pond. Parking at Wickaboxet is very limited, so we will do a very short (&amp;lt;5 minute) carpool from Tillinghast to Wickaboxet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions to Parking:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/em&gt; From I-95, take Exit 5B - Route 102 North. Follow Route 102 for 3 miles, then turn left onto Plain Meetinghouse Road. Turn right at the intersection with Plain Road. Follow Plain Road for 1/2 mile to the parking lot on the right &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
