<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Since Sunday looks like rain again I thought I'd setup a meet for Saturday instead...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's go to the &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; location on Hickory Hill Road.  Park at the end of the street and meet under the power lines right before you enter the woods.  Let's keep the dogs away from the street so others enjoying the trails aren't overwhelmed when trying to park. :)  Please make sure to have poop bags on hand in case any doggies go on the trails and you may want to put something orange on the pooches since it's hunting season (although it's just bow now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One meetup we did last spring was quite an adventure as it didn't loop around and the group decided to try to go &amp;quot;off-trail&amp;quot; in an attempt to create our own loop. Well, thanks to a volunteer group for Musquash there is now a wonderful, newly cut, looping trail extension there.  It should take from 1.25 to 1.5 hours and if anyone wants to continue on another trail after we can do that too.  As this trail has some hilly parts, we can rest anytime anyone needs to.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet under the power lines before trail head entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292763780000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292191709000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Musquash - Hickory Hill Entrance</name><id>15714588</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292686200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/15714588/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/3/global_13504099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
