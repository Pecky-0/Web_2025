 &lt;br /&gt;This Sunday will be a chance to be together and explore the
unique and wonderful setting of the Peace Abbey, visit the animals,
enjoy a great 
&lt;span&gt;vegan&lt;/span&gt;
potluck meal, and hear scholar/professor/author Paul Waldau's
presentation!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;** And remember! **&amp;nbsp; Like No Udder, the vegan ice
cream truck, will be with us selling their smooth and creamy softie
ice cream cones and milk shakes.&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Rain or shine, it will be a beautiful day.&amp;nbsp; Please bring
friends, family, and non-vegetarians -- there is plenty of room and
we welcome non-vegetarians to experience a fabulous vegan meal and
hear this speaker!&amp;nbsp; But never hesitate to come alone; many do,
and we're a friendly group.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;We will be trying a new strategy to facilitate traffic flow
around the potluck tables!
 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;We want to collect a very big donation to give to the Peace
Abbey, not just to cover the cost of our being there, but to help
them continue their steadfast and imaginative work for peace,
nonviolence, and
 &lt;br /&gt;compassionate living.&amp;nbsp; The Peace Abbey has made a
tremendous contribution to promoting vegetarianism.&amp;nbsp; It is
public knowledge that the Peace Abbey needs to raise funds to
continue their great work. A swell of community support keeps the
Peace Abbey in action.&amp;nbsp; Please come with generous hearts, open
checkbooks, and ready cash.&amp;nbsp; We'll pass a free-will donation
box.

 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;6)&amp;nbsp; DIRECTIONS
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The Peace Abbey
 &lt;br /&gt;2 
&lt;span&gt;North Main
Street&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Where Route 27 and Route 16 overlap
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Sherborn,
MA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; (next to Natick, 35-40 min. west of 
&lt;span&gt;Boston&lt;/span&gt;)
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/" target="_blank"&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;http://maps.google.com/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;From Boston:
 &lt;br /&gt;Take Route 9 West and exit at Route 16 in Wellesley.&amp;nbsp;
Turn left at end of ramp onto Rt. 16 West.
 &lt;br /&gt;Follow directions below.
 &lt;br /&gt;~ OR ~
 &lt;br /&gt;Take Mass Pike West to Exit 16 (Wellesley) Take Route 16
West, winding scenically through Wellesley, 
&lt;span&gt;Natick&lt;/span&gt;,
and into Sherborn.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Watch signs carefully; Rt. 16
takes some sharp left turns.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;*You are almost at the Peace Abbey* when you see the 
&lt;span&gt;Sherborn Inn&lt;/span&gt;
on your right, then the Sherborn Fire House (white) on your
left.&amp;nbsp; When you ride over a small railroad track, and go up a
small hill, the Peace Abbey is just ahead on your left, just after
an area of trees.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are signs and a large
statue of Gandhi out front.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;From the West:
 &lt;br /&gt;Take Route 9 East, then take Route 27 South through Natick
and into Sherborn.&amp;nbsp; Rt. 27 will overlap with Rt. 16 in
Sherborn, so see directions above for landmarks on Rt. 16/27.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;7)&amp;nbsp; FREE PARKING
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of free parking in three convenient parking
areas:
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;a)&amp;nbsp; The small paved lot at the Abbey will be for special
needs/handicap, speaker, and BVS staff ONLY.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;b)&amp;nbsp; Street parking:&amp;nbsp; Approaching from the north
(that is, if you are on Rt. 16W or Rt. 27S, which overlap), pass
the Peace Abbey driveway on your left and take the next
left.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Park along this road "Village
Way" ON
 &lt;br /&gt;ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD ONLY.&amp;nbsp; Two sided parking is *not
allowed*.&amp;nbsp; This road leads to a housing
complex.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Park ONLY along the entrance
road.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DO NOT PARK in the visitor or resident
spaces for the housing park!&amp;nbsp; NOTE: They will TOW cars parked
where I've said not to park.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;c)&amp;nbsp; Church lot:&amp;nbsp; We can park in the 
&lt;span&gt;Unitarian
Universalist Church lot&lt;/span&gt; just a 2-3 minute walk from the
Peace Abbey.&amp;nbsp; This is where the speaker presentation will
be.&amp;nbsp; If you like, you can drop off your 
&lt;span&gt;potluck dish&lt;/span&gt;
at the Peace Abbey gate, then go park.&amp;nbsp; We'll put your dish on
the stone fence till you return.&amp;nbsp; Approaching from the north,
pass the Peace Abbey on your left, and you will face a fork in the
road.&amp;nbsp; Go to *right* of
 &lt;br /&gt;fork (Rt. 16).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Continue 500 ft. and you'll
see the U.U. Church (white wooden historic church) on your
left.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Park in the lots on both sides of the
church.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;d)&amp;nbsp; Church lot #2:&amp;nbsp; If somehow you don't park at
the above, the Pilgrim Church lot is nearby on Rt. 27.&amp;nbsp; So at
the fork, bear left onto Rt. 27.&amp;nbsp; Pilgrim church is just ahead
on the left.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;8)&amp;nbsp; OVERNIGHT ACCOMMODATIONS
