Cristi (Dragos Bucur) is a young undercover cop pressured to arrest a teenager who offers pot to two of his schoolmates. Not wanting to ruin the life of a young man he considers merely irresponsible, Cristi must either allow the arrest to be a burden on his conscience, or face censure by his superior (Vlad Ivanov of 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days) for whom the word “conscience” has an entirely different meaning. Porumboiu wields his camera like a well-aimed weapon, revealing his story with little dialogue and gradually increasing tension, until the unexpected conclusion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Police, Adjective tells a small story well. At the level of plot, it is consistently engaging, and the psychology of the ambivalent detective, a staple of film noir, is given a new twist in the character of Cristi. But the more closely you look, the more you see: a movie about a marriage, about a career in crisis, about a society riven by unstated class antagonisms and hobbled by ancient authoritarian habits. So much in this meticulous and moving film is between the lines, and almost nothing is by the book.&amp;quot;  -- The New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The usual emphasis in a detective film is upended so that procedure, thrillingly, is more important than action. In its own way, this is one of the most intense cop movies you’ll see.&amp;quot; -- 4 stars, Boston Globe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event may be a bit last-minute, but I still hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the film I'll be near the front of the theater holding a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264522186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Police, Adjective</name><id>12427887</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264886100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12427887/</event_url></item>
