<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;My two boys are three and oneÂ  and we would like to host Weekly playdates on Mondays. We have a fenced in backyard and a finished basement that the kids can play in. On some nice days we can visit the nearby park &amp;amp; pond with nice sandy beach. So come over and have some fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: the playdate has been changed to 1pm instead of 10am. My older son has morning preschool this Fall so we need to do it after he gets out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>ren</member_name><member_id>14637040</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347912607000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346617178000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Backyard Fun Monday Playdates</name><id>qhpccdyqmbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347901200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/80533872/</event_url></item>
