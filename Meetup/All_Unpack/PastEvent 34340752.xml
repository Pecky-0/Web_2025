Hang out, eat festival food and listen to music in the park. &amp;nbsp;For a small donation, it is possible to participate in the people's choice judging. &amp;nbsp;The artists start at 10, so by 1, many designs are quite easy to make out, as well as see the masters of chalk at work. Last years designs varied from fantastical to realistic and also had quite a variety of chalk techniques on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance is free.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a meetup sign, meet at the concession stands at the Kennedy plaza end.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317667783000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316562549000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence Street "Painting" Festival</name><id>34340752</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317576600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/34340752/</event_url></item>
