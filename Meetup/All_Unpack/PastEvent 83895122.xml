It's housed in the space that had been Sel de la Terre-Waterfront. It's located across the street from the Long Wharf Marriott at the corner of State St. and Atlantic Avenue. I've had brunch there the last 2 Sundays and found the food to be very creative. The Huevos Rancheros was terrific and I will order it again on the 30th. Yesterday, I had the Poached Lobster- also excellent. The brunch menu changes regularly, so we're not limited to what's posted on their website. Brunch entrees run $12-19 and you can also order from their lunch menu if you'd like. The portions are good sized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We'll mingle over bellinis and bloody Marys at the bar from 12:00-1:00, then sit down to order brunch at about 1:00. Please bring cash, as we won't get separate checks. Hope you can join us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
