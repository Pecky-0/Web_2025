<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's decide how best to form and to promote this group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, my Chorus, Sounds of Concord, will sponsor it and provide space, but we might consider moving to another date/time if that is more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose should be to promote Barbershop Singing and to share tips, techniques, and stuff going on, and to have fun with other members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Chorus typically goes out to dinner after rehearsals, (about 10 P.M.) so for those who are late nighters, that is an option too.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Lee Daum or Dan Costello or Jim Kenealy from Sounds of Concord.  We rehearse in this location at 7:30.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lee</member_name><member_id>6728437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327885626000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>If you are a singer or love to hear good singing you'll love it; we sing four part a cappella harmony.  We also do some choreographed moves (nothing too hard), too.
