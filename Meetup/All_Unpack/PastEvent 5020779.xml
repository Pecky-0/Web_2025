<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a 4.4 mile hike in Nehantic State Forest. The land is mostly covered with a second growth of hardwoods. There are a number of good trout streams in the forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the park at 2 PM at the parking area by northern end of Uncas Pond (see the map). Then we'll follow the blue blazed trail that starts out from the parking area. After hiking .67 mile we will reach a loop in the blue trail that we willl follow in a clockwise direction. When we get back to the junction we'll head back to the parking area. The hike should last about 2.25 hrs. at a leasurly pace and be over by about 4:15 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swimming is allowed so bring a bathing suit! We can hit the water after a hot hike. The group has the option of stopping someplace in the hiking area (TBD) for dinner after the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this one is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;) so please direct questions on this event to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayaking is possible at Uncas Pond or Norwich pond for those so inclined for an after hike activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pets on a leash are permitted on hiking trails.
