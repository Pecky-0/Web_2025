We'll start our day at &lt;a href="http://www.essexheritage.org/sites/fort_sewall.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;Fort Sewall &lt;/a&gt;.  From this great location you can also shoot &lt;a href="http://www.lighthouse.cc/marblehead/" target="_blank"&gt;Marblehead Light&lt;/a&gt;.  Then we'll stroll the streets of historic downtown Marblehead and discover photo ops as we go along (or maybe even pick up a holiday gift or two if you haven't finished your shopping yet!)  On the way to lunch (Location TBD) we'll stop at Winter Island to shoot the &lt;a href="http://www.lighthouse.cc/fortpickering/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fort Pickering Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At lunch we'll discuss our favorite events from this past year (and why) and then put our collective heads together to discuss where and what we'd like to shoot in the year ahead.  Afterwards those who haven't had their fill of shooting may be interested in checking out &lt;a href="http://www.lighthouse.cc/derbywharf/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; Derby Wharf Light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see everyone at our last meeting of 2008!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231100124000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201475930000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion Group December Meetup </name><id>7208908</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229270400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/7208908/</event_url></item>
