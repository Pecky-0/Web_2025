We have done this topic several times and it is always fun to see where we go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a dish that can serve at least 4 people and be ready for good food, good conversation and a great time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you there!  It is important to RSVP this time as this is usually a very well attended meetup and there others besides meetup members who participate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271727416000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269955857000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Who Were You in the Past?</name><id>khcdnyngbwb</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271541600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/13035763/</event_url></item>
