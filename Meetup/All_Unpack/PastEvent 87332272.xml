We have all speeds of walkers but no one (unlike kayaking) gets too far ahead and goes in the wrong direction, and (like kayaking) no one will be left behind (4 2 long). We’re here for good times, and exercise. Everyone Talks &amp;amp; Walks at their own pace and that’s what makes this event great for all. So if you haven’t come before, please join us this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week will be a bit different from the past weeks. For those that can make it, we will start the walk earlier at 5:15pm. Everyone else can meet us at the same place at 5:30-5:45pm when we come by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after the walk, at ~ 6:30 we’ll head down to the BBC in Westford for a light dinner and beer! Anyone new joining us for the walk – great, we want to meet you and hear YOUR interesting stories!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please, when you RSVP also make the comment “BBC” if you’ll be joining us at the BBC (British Beer Company) after our walk. This is important because we need a headcount in advance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll meet between 5:00 - 5:15pm at the concert park benches just across the street from Heritage Ice Cream &amp;amp; Restaurant. For those that don’t know me, you will. I’ll have a MEETUP pin on the back of my cap. My cell #; (603) 204-1657 and the volume is now turned UP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a DOG FRIENDLY WALK, so bring them along if you wish, but if you’re going to the BBC after, please make appropriate plans in advance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Ordway</member_name><member_id>4903547</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351011431000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350448811000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Walk &amp; Talk Along the River!</name><id>87332272</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350939600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/87332272/</event_url></item>
