I LOVED seeing my dog, Kay, watching from the top of the hill for each of her friends to appear at the entrance below us. She would quiver with joy! In this year we both have established relationships with pups and peeps that we treasure. I know Bedford is having issues regarding leash laws...but as long as we are respectful of others and clean up after ourselves as we always do there should not be a problem. Your dog also should have some basic good manners toward other people, children and other dogs. Summer seems to be trying to get going so let's enjoy it with friends during the week. What better way to shed the stress of a day at work??? Please join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carolyn Abbott</member_name><member_id>8030141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249139415000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247925908000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Romp at the Park</name><id>10903197</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248300900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10903197/</event_url></item>
