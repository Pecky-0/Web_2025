I'm happy to oblige as this is one of my faves, and a great place to know about. So this week we're going to  enjoy the waterfront on the OTHER side of town - the Seekonk River. Where's THAT, you say? Its that river that we drive over on 195 to go to Seekonk, MA or the Cape! The Waterman Grille is at the end of Waterman Ave. in Richmond Square  - all the way at the end of Waterman Ave. So at the end, you may have never seen it, but its a gem. If you've ever driven over the Henderson Bridge to East Providence, aka The Red Bridge, you've probably seen it on the right (at least you can' t miss the pink building).  So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll find us, we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
