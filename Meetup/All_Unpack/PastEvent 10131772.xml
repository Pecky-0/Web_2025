<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>An-Ra is a beautiful, gentle and loving system of healing that was brought to the directors of Pathways through their&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;own personal experiences as well as the information channeled from their guides. The healers learn to draw upon the unconditional love of mother earth with the Divine Compassion, Understanding, Wisdom and Forgiveness of Source,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and to direct this energy from their hearts into the person receiving the healing. During this evening of healing the participants will&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;learn how they can co create their own healing, there will be an energy circle, powerful guided meditation and individual An-Ra Energy work by the certified An-Ra Healers. Donations accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is the 19th year that Dr. Bezmen has been doing these monthly healings for the public.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>William and Judith will be there to greet you.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>William Bezmen</member_name><member_id>8774813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240531866000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Holistic health &amp; Spiritualist</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Pathways-to-Health</urlname><id>1369837</id><group_lat>40.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-73.0100021362</group_lon><name>Pathways To Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239067448000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An-Ra Energy Healing Night &amp; Meditation</name><id>10131772</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239406200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Pathways-to-Health/events/10131772/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/0/global_7118880.jpeg</photo_url></item>
