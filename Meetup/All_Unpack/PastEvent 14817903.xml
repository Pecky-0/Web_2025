We will hike through some beautiful pine woods, by several cranberry bogs, &lt;br /&gt;and near a pond and campground. There will be a few small rolling hills, but much of the hike will be relatively flat. &lt;br /&gt;Since parking is limited at the starting point, we will meet at Park Headquarters at 12:45 and car pool to the starting point which is on Bare Hill Road near the Fire Tower. &lt;br /&gt;Hike distance is 4+ miles. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Vickstrom</member_name><member_id>11406046</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286580988000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284859655000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October First Sunday Hike of the Month</name><id>14817903</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286124300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/14817903/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/6/global_18045126.jpeg</photo_url></item>
