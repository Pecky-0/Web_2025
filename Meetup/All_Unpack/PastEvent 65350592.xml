It is a mixed comp and we need at least 2 girls in the team, so if you know anyone who is interested in playing please let me know.  Previous rugby experience is not required... &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 A team costs $200 to register, so the more people we get, the cheaper it is per person. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If you are keen to play or want more info please contact Jon on &lt;a target="_blank"&gt;(617) 686 5404&lt;/a&gt; or mangist@gmail.com &lt;br /&gt;
