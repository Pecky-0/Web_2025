This used to be the BPC.   If you knew it, or knew of it.  Then you know it was AWESOME late night poker all the time.  We were serious about our poker, even if it wasn't always serious poker.

It's against the law to run a poker house, so this is my super-pumped-up home poker game.
Most of the tournaments are between $30-$100.
There are 3-4 games each week, and they'll be posted on the calender.
There's always a cash game after the tournaments - we are poker players after all!

THIS IS A CASINO GAME WITH HOME RULES!!!
Confused?  Oh well.  LOL!!!
