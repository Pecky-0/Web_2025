Thanks, Margarita for noticing the change.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A family’s peaceful existence is threatened when a busy highway opens next their house in the middle of nowhere. Refusing to move, Marthe (Isabelle Huppert), Michel, and their three children find innovative ways to adapt to their new environment, but suspicions about the highway’s potential danger cause family tension. In French with English subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it. Afterwards, we'll go out to eat and discuss. Probably the Vietnamese restaurant on Huntington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will check more carefully this time.  I hope none of you actually showed up on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fay&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be standing in the aisle with a homemade sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fay </member_name><member_id>3089505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271005336000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trying to go "Home" again</name><id>13149859</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271455200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/13149859/</event_url></item>
