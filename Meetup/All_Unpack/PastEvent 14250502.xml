He spent one year at the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University before coming to Berklee, where he has reaped the benefits of the performance and music production and engineering programs, which feature a foundation in practical experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since arriving on the Boston scene, Kain has built a performance schedule as a session keyboardist/producer (Rachel Borovik, Chloe Bean and the Spills, Brianne Crawford) and jazz innovator and sideman (Mark Hadley Quintet, James Peipon Quartet, the Brothers Kain Collective). His drive and dependability shine in a wide range of settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to create your route by public transit.
