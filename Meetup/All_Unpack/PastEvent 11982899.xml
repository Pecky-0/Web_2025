(the fire keeps you super warm, but if it's extremely cold or damp, we'll drum inside).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of the stresses of the busy holiday season, now is a good time to take part in group drumming. Experience the many benefits, such as stress release, creativity, heightened awareness,, self expression, connection, and JOY! This is a great way to experience the Peace and Love that  are meant to be the true meaning of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All levels of experience are welcome, especially those who have never drummed. Nobody is put on the spot to perform. This is a  very laid back circle where participants are encouraged to follow their own authentic rhythm. Bring your own drum or percussion,or use one of our extras!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sally Fiore</member_name><member_id>8203589</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261354288000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259611405000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Drum for Joy" at The Larches</name><id>11982899</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261180800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/11982899/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/6/7/global_10366711.jpeg</photo_url></item>
