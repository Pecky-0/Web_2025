It is a privilege we do not want to abuse, so please be sensitive to the issues, such as soil/trail preservation, park hours, and the tranquility and safety of fellow users and park regulations.&lt;br /&gt;Best practices include:&lt;br /&gt;· Ride through the center of a mud patch or puddle, NOT around it.&lt;br /&gt;· Ride over an obstacle, NOT around it.&lt;br /&gt;· If you can't ride over an obstacle, get off and walk it - stay on the trail.&lt;br /&gt;· Do not make new routes or trails.&lt;br /&gt;· Do not build stunts.&lt;br /&gt;· Do not skid, spin out, or fishtail - uphill nor downhill.&lt;br /&gt;· Slow down when you see other riders, hikers, or animals.&lt;br /&gt;· Always offer to yield the right of way.&lt;br /&gt;· Be friendly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and  more information is available on the  DCR site at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/fells.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for  keeping it cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought you all would want to know about this GREAT Event!! &lt;br /&gt;~ Enjoy Tara&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>DIRECTIONS TO FLYNN RINK
