Hopefully create new contacts to maybe spawn the creation of new game groups and expand your circle of friends. A great opportunity for new members of our group to make some contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some light refreshment and food will probably be provided depending on the RSVP count.&lt;br /&gt;We might also have some small prices, primarily duplicate gaming books or miniatures I want to give away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us know what you'd like to add to the agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Items had been:&lt;br /&gt;- Play a GMless game that doesn't require preparation such as Universalis&lt;br /&gt;- Watch a gaming related move (e.g. the Gamers, Monty Python, ...)&lt;br /&gt;- Card/Board Games&lt;br /&gt;- Tarot Card - Raffle / Tombola&lt;br /&gt;- Beer Tasting&lt;br /&gt;- ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian&lt;br /&gt;Your Friendly Organzier&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christian Loidl</member_name><member_id>1035154</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242597799000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240202171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring Fellowship Gathering</name><id>10223311</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242424800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/10223311/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/global_3081279.jpeg</photo_url></item>
