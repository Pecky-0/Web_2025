A film that could be seen over and over again. ” - Ruth, International Arthouse Movie Group&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francois and his fellow teachers prepare for a new year at a high school in a tough neighborhood. Armed with the best intentions, they brace themselves to not let discouragement stop them from trying to give the best education to their students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cultures and attitudes often clash in the classroom, a microcosm of contemporary France. As amusing and inspiring as the teenaged students can be, their difficult behavior can still jeopardize and teacher's enthusiasm for the low-paying job. Francois insists on an atmosphere of respect and diligence. Neither stuffy nor severe, his extravagant frankness often takes the students by surprise. But his classroom ethics are put to the test when his students begin to challenge his methods...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.
