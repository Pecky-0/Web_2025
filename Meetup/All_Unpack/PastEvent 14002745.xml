It is classic Tarintino, bloody violent yet strangely humorous.  However, there are many scenes that are founded on  intricate and intense dialogue between charters. And, in my opinion, some outstanding acting, especially from &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910607/" target="_blank"&gt;Christoph Waltz&lt;/a&gt;, who won an Oscar for his portrait as an SS Officer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the motive we can head upstairs to Café Algiers for some food, drink, what ever, and talk about the film or life or what ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waitng out side by the ticket both starting at 6:30. I'll be wearing a crimson colored Harvard baseball cap. At 6:45 I'll be going in the theater. If you arrive after 6:45, go inside the theather and look for my baseball hat.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>ShaneO</member_name><member_id>8134848</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293825871000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278296189000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Inglourious Bastards</name><id>14002745</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278714600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/14002745/</event_url></item>
