&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave it to bestselling author Antoinette Stockenberg to deliver a modern tale that moves effortlessly between this world and the next as a man, a woman, and a hundred-year-old ghost cross paths on the way to their destinies.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;EMILY'S GHOST&lt;/em&gt; is a RITA award-winning novel filled with humor, passion, and profound emotion; a classic of the genre. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;A showdown between a U.S. Senator who believes in ghosts and a reporter who doesn't. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Emily Bowditch, investigative journalist, is a typical New Englander: proud, stubborn, tightfisted and skeptical. So she's determined to expose aristocratic Senator Lee Alden's fascination with psychic phenomena and his willingness to waste good taxpayer dollars to fund research in it. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Her plan is first to gain his confidence by convincing him that she has psychic powers. That plan flops. The tables are turned and somehow Emily finds herself at a seance as guest of the sexy, recently widowed young senator. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

As seances go, not much happens, despite the disturbing, electrifying tension in the room. It's not until Emily is back in her tiny Boston condo that she realizes ... she hasn't come home alone. Fergus O'Malley, a handsome 19th century scoundrel hanged for a murder he swears he didn't commit, needs someone to clear him of the crime. Emily, apparently, is it. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

And so begins a hair-raising odyssey full of twists and turns and danger on both sides of the veil as Emily tries to navigate between senator and ghost and her growing feelings for both.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barbara </member_name><member_id>7313867</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nichole Graff</member_name><member_id>10861587</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354493393000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
