During this session we will discuss the “Action Steps” that we have taken since November. We will also make plans to set up committees in several regions across the state, and find volunteers to lead them. The promoters of Agenda 21 are very well organized. The only way to combat them and defeat them is to be very well organized as well. If you hope to defeat this great threat to our freedom and private property rights, please make sure to attend this event. Hal Shurtleff the Regional Field Director of The John Birch Society &amp;amp; John Beidler of Connecticut Oath Keepers will serve as the moderators. We will have literature tables with books, DVD’s and handouts on Agenda 21. Education is the key to victory. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Admission: $5:00 &lt;br /&gt;

Sponsored by Connecticut Oath Keepers &amp;amp; The John Birch Society &lt;br /&gt;
