&lt;p&gt;9 am to 5 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nichrien Buddhist Sangha of Greater New England is proud to offer a fun and engaging full day workshop for anyone interested in learning basic Buddhists concepts and experiencing the rich traditions of this Japanese school of Buddhism. Nichiren Shu Buddhism is a Mahayana Buddhist practice based on the Lotus Sutra and the teachings of the 12th century Japanese monk, Nichiren Shonin. Nichiren Buddhism is the second largest school of Buddhism in Japan and has been in the United Staes for over one hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is designed for those who want to lean about basic Buddhism and experience the practice of Nichiren Shu Buddhism at the New England temple in Haverhill, MA. Through lecture, discussion, and experiential activities, we’ll explore the supportive theories and practices behind this 2500 year old religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facilitator Reverend Ryuoh Faulconer has been a Nichiren Shu minister since 2001. Prior to leading the New England temple, he was the resident minister at the Portland, OR Nichiren Shu Temple for four and a half years. He has specialized training in Buddhist iconography, Reidan, Shomyo and Reiki and is deeply passionate about teaching the Dharma.&lt;/p&gt;

You do not have to prepay for the class. (The meetup page does not always show the number of people registered as we use several media’s for our calendar and events.)&lt;/p&gt;
