We ate in the front dining room and had a great time! The service, food, and company all contributed to a wonderful evening. So let's go back again, sit out on the patio, and enjoy the riverfront views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Back Porch is located in a marina, with an expansive view of the CT river. The patio is large, with firepits, a bar, and lots of tables we can put relatively close together. They don't take reservations on the patio, but they are very accommodating. Come relax with us as we get ready for the weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band on the 14th is the Smoke Bubbles Band, and they start around 8:00. Dress is casual, and remember it may be buggy outside.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Give my name to the hostess, and she will bring you to our tables.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253491688000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249513291000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunset on the Back Porch.... hopefully!</name><id>11045251</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250289000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/11045251/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/8/a/global_9713258.jpeg</photo_url></item>
