Then we'll head over using the free Harpoon shuttle. What nice people those brewers are.  If you miss us at South Station or just want to meet us at the brewery anyways, that's fine - I will email my cell number the morning of the event to yes and maybe RSVPs so you can find us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, even though there is no deadline, please try and RSVP by 3pm on June 5th so I know who to look for at Clarke's. Maybe's will be considered a &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; at that point. Thanks! :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273081007000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243365011000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harpoon Summer Session </name><id>10496727</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244237400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/10496727/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/5/global_8821461.jpeg</photo_url></item>
