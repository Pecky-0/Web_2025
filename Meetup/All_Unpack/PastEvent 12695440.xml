There is a 7-11 nearby if you need food or drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;What to expect:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People sitting around playing games and having a good time. No video games. Expect people to be playing games such as Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, Magic: The Gathering, Agricola, Race for the Galaxy, Pandemic, Chaos in the Old World, and Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition. (This doesn't mean that all of these games will be there, just that they serve as good examples.) Also, &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; games such as Risk, Monopoly, Clue, Stratego and Battleship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hoping to make this a weekly event, but that hinges on how well our first few weeks go. So, show up and bring friends! Tell people you think would be interested! Let's make this a great night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to paying $3.00 at the door, we will ask you to sign a sign-in sheet, and ask for comments and suggestions. We are looking to hold raffles in the future, as well as other special events, and as always, donations are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=250003843756" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff M</member_name><member_id>4602649</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267999301000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Gamers</urlname><id>393834</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Greater Nashua Gamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267030115000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community Game Night</name><id>12695440</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267826400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Gamers/events/12695440/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/f/global_13305711.jpeg</photo_url></item>
