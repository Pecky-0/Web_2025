The band &amp;quot;The Complaints&amp;quot; will be playing the night I am scheduling this meet-up.  Not sure what they are like, but hopefully they're decent:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing many new faces, and many returning members too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and hope to see you gals soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lisa</member_name><member_id>2136226</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261413072000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fabulous Females</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore</urlname><id>1511961</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>South Shores' Fabulous Females Unite!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260233456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's get into the holiday spirit at the British Beer Company in Walpole!!!</name><id>12039889</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261186200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore/events/12039889/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/2/global_10481810.jpeg</photo_url></item>
