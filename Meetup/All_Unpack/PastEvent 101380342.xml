You may have felt violated in some horrid incident and can never imagine going through forgiveness. The truth is, forgiveness is for your own healing, it is not for the one who hurt you. It also is to assist you in letting go of the negative feelings that hold you back and replacing them with positive feelings. Life is sweeter when we have love and appreciation for EVERYTHING. Join us and take your first step of letting go of the past and living fully in your present. Cost is $15 per person&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362013981000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359145959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Healing The Heart With Forgiveness w/ Barb Tremlett</name><id>101380342</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>5400000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362007800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/101380342/</event_url></item>
