Or All We Have to Gain?&lt;br /&gt;Friday, October 31 â€¢ 7:30 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is your greatest hesitation about getting on board with a real spiritual path? Is it the transformation you might go through or that you might become unrecognizable to yourself or so dynamic beyond your imagination? Nelson Mandela said it beautifully in his inaugural speech in 1994, &amp;quot;Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God.&amp;quot; Let seminar presenter Mother Clare Watts fill the gap between your hesitation and the reality of you living out the path you were meant to live out as a soul. &lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;about Mother Clare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare is a mystic; ordained priest; Master Teacher of Christian mysticism; and co-director of a mystical Christian Order, a school with 15 Centers of Light in cities across the country.
