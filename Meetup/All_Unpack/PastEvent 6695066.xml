I will of course volunteer my car which holds 6 others.  We will hit the streets of Boston and capture some of the city lights at night.  Fanuel Hall, The Waterfront, Statehouse, Newbury Street, I was thinking of some shots of the bridge from the Garden T-stop which has a great shots of traffic heading north(for anyone interested in the ever so popular car contrails shot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any other places of interest please let me know.  I will map out a route in the next few weeks.  Also if anyone knows of a good place to get together after for some drinks/food please let us know..&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197645090000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194451466000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>City Streets - Boston at Night</name><id>6695066</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196467200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/6695066/</event_url></item>
