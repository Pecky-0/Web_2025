A short instruction/refresher will be given to the beginner players.   The format will be based on the traditional 13 tiles format. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the $2 Meetup fees, there will be a buy-in fees to enter the tournament.  Each player in the beginner group will pay a $2 buy-in fee to enter the tournament.  The Intermediate/Advanced group will have a $10 buy-in (or higher if players agree).  Please indicate your MJ skill so I can pair up people in similar level.  As a rule of thumb, you should rate yourself a beginner if you don't know how to count score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will take place from 3:30 to 6:30pm so please make sure you can COMMIT FOR 3 HOURS before you register.  The game is in 4 some format so you cannot come late or leave early as you will affect three other players.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Warren</member_name><member_id>5756338</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1227980400000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225779404000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mahjong Championship</name><id>9090570</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227385800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/9090570/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/f/global_6194895.jpeg</photo_url></item>
