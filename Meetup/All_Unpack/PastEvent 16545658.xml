&lt;p&gt;Wow, February Karaoke Meetup was rocking! &amp;nbsp;We had so much fun. &amp;nbsp;If you did not make it, we missed you. &amp;nbsp;With the current seasons of American Idol and Glee on television, there are more people interested in singing than ever! &amp;nbsp;If you are one of those, please join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please sign up early. &amp;nbsp;I know many of you wait until the last minute to sign up because your plans are not firm yet. &amp;nbsp;If you think you might come, just RSVP "yes", you can always update your RSVP later if your plans change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce another Boston Karaoke Meetup on March 12th 2011! It's at the Courtside Restaurant and Pub in Cambridge MA again. Courtside has an excellent selection of over 20,000 songs and many large screens for viewing lyrics. Whatever kind of music you enjoy, there will be something for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the Karaoke Lounge reserved just for us from 7-9PM so please try to get there by 7PM to get the most out of this Meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is free for anyone who does not sing, so feel free to come and just listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,   &lt;br /&gt;-Phil&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in the back with the Karaoke machine or call me at 617-429-6571</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Philip L</member_name><member_id>1522860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1302388648000</updated><rating><average>4.38000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><why>It's really fun... you get to perform in front of a live audience.
