Sorry for any confusion. Yesterday, both Patriots and NFL websites said it was a 5:00pm start.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;========================= &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invited Groups are Social Fun, and Boston Happy Hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for a 2012 Red Sox Natives exclusive event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us at Battery Park for a Patriots Giants Viewing Party to watch the New England Patriots take on the St. Louis Rams on Sunday, October 28 from Wembly Stadium in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive at 12:30pm to get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAME TIME IS NOW 1:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives have organized weekly viewing parties over the last year with guests from several other invited groups attending at various locations in Boston, Woburn and Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park is conveniently located in the Financial District in Boston.  Greg, the most excellent manager, will reserve space/tables just for our group. They have plenty of TVs and will have sound on for the game. The Natives have attended many events at Battery Park.The Patriots and Ram are playing at Wembley Stadium in the UK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park has a great selection of beer and the food is great! (the Shepard's Pie!)  Batter Park is a short walk from Downtown Crossing (Red and Orange Lines), Gov't Center (Green and Blue Lines), and Aquarium (Blue Line).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
