Paul is hosting this Meetup to help his friend and anyone else who wants to drop in, have some coffee, and learn/practice some signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are more advanced and want to help beginners, you are also welcome to join Paul! Just be sure to sign very slowly and be very patient. This is for beginners, who need to develop their receptive skills in a friendly, beginner-oriented environment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your ASL dictionary if you like!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>10642770</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287923415000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ASL Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonasl</urlname><id>1298565</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston ASL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287503561000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beginners Meetup! </name><id>15159091</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287860400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonasl/events/15159091/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/1/global_16399809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
