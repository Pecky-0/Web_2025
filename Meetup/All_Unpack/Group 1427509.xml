YOU MISSED A GREAT EVENT ON 1/21/10!
The Rainmakers Group held an open house on 1/21/10 and an informative seminar/workshop was given by photographer, videographer and search engine optimization guru Val Nanovsky of Valdorama.com. Val gave an eloquent talk and invited comments and discussion about the "Social Media Revolution" going on today through Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn as the major players. Thanks to all of the "Rainmakers" for helping to make our first open house and presentation a success!</description><rating>4.72</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1239022520000</created><lat>41.8400001526</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>10117</id><urlkey>businessnetwork</urlkey><name>Business Strategy and Networking</name></topics_item></topics><name>Rainmakers Business Strategy / Networking Meetup Group 06066</name><id>1427509</id><members>42</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>3309360</member_id><name>Thomas Psillas</name></organizer><urlname>Rainmakers-Business-Strategy-Networking-Meetup-Group-06066</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/a/5/600_11630597.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/a/5/highres_11630597.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>11630597</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/a/5/thumb_11630597.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Vernon Rockville</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Rainmakers-Business-Strategy-Networking-Meetup-Group-06066/</link><lon>-72.4599990845</lon></item>
