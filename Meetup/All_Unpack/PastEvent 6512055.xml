You will have one day to complete this task.  You will be given a list of address and instructions on what to do upon arriving at the meeting place.  Your participate could make or break the future of this great nation of ours....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in the Parking lot in the area near the intersection of Spit brook rd and DW Highway.  We'll do a brief sign wave until everyone gets there. Then we'll hand out packets, do a brief tutorial, and then head out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need both drivers and canvassers. Typically we like to have two canvassers and one driver per team.  It takes about 2-3 hours for a team to complete one packet depending on how close the houses are.  When you RSVP, please indicate whether you would like to be a canvasser or driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: THIS CANVASSING EVENT STARTS AT 10AM.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193666632000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191867483000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canvassing in Nashua</name><id>6512055</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193493600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6512055/</event_url></item>
