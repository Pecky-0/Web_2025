We're not going to have a centralized meeting place. I'm posting this as more of an FYI. Read on for more info...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a hot air balloon festival in Hudson, MA this weekend. After our kamikaze weekend of shooting we didn't think that we'd be up for such an early morning already. We had such a great time, and the photo ops were extraordinary, that we've decided to do it again! I'm not planning a formal event around this, but feel free to join us for an informal shoot. The details are below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; 91 Park St&lt;br /&gt;           Hudson, MA 01749&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; 4:30a.m.-5a.m. (the balloons lift off at 6, but we plan to stake out a place to shoot and setup early)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rain Date:&lt;/b&gt; August 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Website:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.hudsonelks.com/Balloon%20Festival%202010/Hot%20Air%20Balloon%20Agenda%20-%207-20-10.JPG" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hudson Elks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to attend RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and I'll send you my cellphone number. Feel free to call when you arrive to see where we're shooting/setting up if you'd like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes only the slightest bit of wind to cancel lift off, if that happens we may end up attending the Sunday morning lift off instead. (scheduled for the same time) I'll try to post an update if that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all this weekend!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282089368000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281461249000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hudson Balloon Festival - Morning Lift Off</name><id>14379805</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281774600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/14379805/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_3584529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
