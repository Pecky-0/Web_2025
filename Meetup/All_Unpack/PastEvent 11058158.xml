They also happen to be identical twins, in early twenties, hoping to leave the squalor behind and move into a life of prosperity and dignity. But the similarity ends here. Guddu works as a trainee in a small NGO firm in the city. He hopes to climb up to the top of the corporate ladder. He wants to be a bonafide member of the burgeoning Indian middle class. His career has only just begun though and the road to bourgeoisie is both long and arduous. Yet Guddu is at it. He is honest, diligent and careful. Especially careful. Charlie makes a living hedging bets at the race course. He moves around the plush hordes of the rich and famous at the races. For him this is just a way to make quick money and he dreams of becoming a legitimate bookie one day. Charlie is street smart, wily and brave. And only for himself. The brothers don't like each other. They believe they have nothing in common, not even their speech defect. While Guddu stammers, especially when he is nervous, Charlie has a lisp. The brothers have built their lives so that their paths don't ever cross. They believe it's only a question of time before they are out of each other's sight forever. All that is about to change. In one day. A day of reckoning. An unusual day; just right for the unusual events that unfold in its course. Charlie is having a bad day at the office. He has practically bet everything he possesses on a coveted derby race. But at the last minute,he is double crossed as the race is fixed in their opponent's favour. He hunts down the jockey and plans to get even when the rival goons burst in. In the ensuing melee, Charlie and friends take off with a getaway car. Not knowing that the car belongs to a ruthless pair of cops, LOBO and LELE, who run drugs for the beach lord, TASHI. Soon enough, Charlie discovers a stash of cocaine in the boot of the car. All hell breaks loose now, as the cops and the drug mafia get after his case. Charlie has to survive. And by his wits alone. Guddu is performing a street theatre act when his newfound girlfriend, Sweety BHOPE appears on the scene, distraught and announces that she is pregnant. Guddu is shocked at first but realizes quickly that there is no real problem. They can get married right away! They can't. There is a real problem. Sweety reveals her secret; her brother is Sunil 'chopper' Bhope. A Gangster with political ambitions. A ridiculously dangerous man. And he already knows. Sweety informs Guddu that as they speak, her brother's men are out for his blood. The story unfolds as the day progresses. Intercut between the parallel stories of the brothers as they run to protect themselves, their dreams and their love. Until a point where it converges and the brothers meet to realize that they only have each other. It is only through trust in each other that they can get out of the mess that they haven't created. They uncover a deadly political-police-underworld nexus. They discover virtues within themselves they thought didn't exist. And most important of all, they find each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shahid Kapoor &lt;br /&gt;Priyanka Chopra &lt;br /&gt;Amol Gupte &lt;br /&gt;Deb Mukherjee &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crew:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTOR : Vishal Bharadwaj &lt;br /&gt;PRODUCER : Ronnie Screwvala &lt;br /&gt;MUSIC : Vishal Bharadwaj &lt;br /&gt;GENRE : Action, Thriller &lt;br /&gt;For Kaminey Boston MA &amp;amp; Hartford CT showtime visit www.imoviecafe.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the lobby 20 minutes before the movie.
