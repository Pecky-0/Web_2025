<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a continuation of the meetup group previously hosted by James Ryan-Henry, and will meet in the same place at the same time (room 1128 at CCRI, on Tuesdays at noon). For all new players, we are in an original campaign world called &amp;quot;The World of Vale.&amp;quot; The party is curtrently at 8th lvl. If you would like to join, please create an 8th lvl character. You may use anything from any of the d20 system books, as long as your power level is equal to that of the other characters, and you do not use anything that would not be found in the time period that the game is set in , which is the Middle Ages (so no guns, lasers, bombs, cars, etc). If you use a nonstandard book, please convert it to Dnd v3.5 rules, which will save everyone a big hassle.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540457000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1155856960000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CCRI Roleplayer's Guild DnD meetup (new)</name><id>5083335</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156262400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/5083335/</event_url></item>
