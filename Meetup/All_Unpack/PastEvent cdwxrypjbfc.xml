&lt;p&gt;You dont have to commit for every week - 2+ weeks makes it worth your while... come 1 week and have a chat/drink even!&amp;nbsp; Bring a mate if you like too (don't have to be Aussie!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts June 2nd (yeah short notice - I've been v-busy!!) It will cost us $20ea if we can get at least 10 (and you get a T-shirt @ that price too...)&amp;nbsp; If we get a bunch we can put 2 teams in or just hook up with other teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is mixed and very very informal (you can even come late since there are at least 2 short games each every week) so if you understand rugby league and like to have some fun - come on along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is T accessible from the JFK - UMASS T stop (&amp;lt; 1/2 km)... so you can drink &amp;amp; ride...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP if you are interested, even on a casual basis - we even have a few Kiwi's that come along &amp;amp; don't mind being associated with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best - summer is coming, in spite of the current weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any questions, give me a buzz 617-842-8076&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best, Brian&lt;/p&gt;
