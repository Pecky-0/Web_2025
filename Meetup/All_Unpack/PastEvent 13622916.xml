My wife and I Steve &amp;amp; Melissa Rosen are hosting a Texas Holdem Tournament on Saturday June 5th at 7 P.M. at our home in Hingham.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately our space is limited so we can only accept the first 8 signups.  However if we do get overwhelming response we will look to find a bigger space to plan future Texas Holdem events.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its going to be a good time and can't wait to see everybody there!  Once I get the list I will reach out to you to get your personal email address to get you directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve rosen</member_name><member_id>3640517</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275832989000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275053047000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Texas Holdem Tournament</name><id>13622916</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275778800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/13622916/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/3/7/global_15340663.jpeg</photo_url></item>
