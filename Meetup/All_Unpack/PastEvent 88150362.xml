This group is about socializing and making new and old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a buffet. $23.00 per person. The food will be good. Includes a DJ, flowers on table. tax &amp;amp; gratuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will need to have a check from you by November 9th to insure we get the reservation. Anyone that rsvp's will get my address to send a check in advance. West Valley Inn will not accept individual credit cards. We need to make a group RSVP. And I will need to give a deposit in advance which is why I need to have your check in advance. I will be sending the rsvp's my address at the close of the rsvp date but feel free to send in advance. &lt;br /&gt;

 this will be run alongside another social group, so more people will be involved... over 25 so far.  let us add ours on and double the size.. really show how great it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have had meals at the place for many years, and have never had a poor meal, or less than a top notch outing.  i am sure this will equal or exceed the others.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick Clark</member_name><member_id>17851281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356815117000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350955409000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Party,   WEST VLY INN, W.
