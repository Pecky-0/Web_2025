Last year the fake blood was very scary - in a rock climbing setting.  After climbing we will go discover the haunted lands around Davis Sq. and beyond.  I'll let you know more exactly as we get closer to the day.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Metro Rock you will need a belay test (or class) so call them for the details...  (or you can just boulder.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be near the water fountains at 7PM.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geoff (617) 501-6217 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Me and Steph are also working on a mad scientist house for the next day (Saturday) so keep your ears to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing money and worthless stocks</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226364855000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224721762000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spooky Rock Climbing at Metro Rock.  </name><id>9014466</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225494000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/9014466/</event_url></item>
