On 6/22/06, due to heavy rain in the forcast, the event has been moved from Wadsworth Falls State Park in Middlefield to Steve's house in South Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original plans had called for 3-legged races, wheelbarrow races, volleyball, bocce, etc. If the weather is good enough, we might still be outside at Sharon's. We can bring various games for indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon (&lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/178/members/2252701/"&gt;http://newintown.meet...&lt;/a&gt;) and Chris will be heading up the event so please post questions to them. We are looking for volunteers to help plan the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great if each person brought something to share for food or drink for the party. Please post in your reply what you will be bringing so excessive duplicates can be minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is a cross listing and combined event with the:&lt;br /&gt;* New In Town meetup (&lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/178/events/4918741/"&gt;http://newintown.meet...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;* Southeastern Connecticut Social Club (&lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/219/events/4927738/"&gt;http://socialnetwork....&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1151341598000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1150131395000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BBQ @ Steve's (was Wadsworth Falls SP and then Sharon's)</name><id>4975885</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1151168400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4975885/</event_url></item>
