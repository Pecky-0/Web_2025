Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.  This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.   I thought that we would bike the length of the whole trail which is approximately 5 miles one way in the direction or Westford MA.  Please pack a snack, as we will stop on our way back on the shore of Hart Pond to enjoy an extended break and re-energize ourselves.  This trail is paved, therefore any type of bike can be used. &lt;br /&gt;If anyone cares to, we can also go in the other direction for another 1 Â½ miles of riding, but I will leave that up to you to decide. &lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 12:00 pm at the rear of the Brickhouse Central Pizza, located at 1 Central Sq, in Chelmsford MA.  This lot has very easy access to the trail, and is right in the center of town.  Central Square is right off of Route 4, which can be accessed from Route 27, 110 or 129.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For information about the trail, you can go on this link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brucefreemanrailtrail.org/trail_plans/rail_trail_links.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.brucefreem...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285578667000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285109787000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy Biking on the Bruce Freeman rail trail</name><id>14850864</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285516800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/14850864/</event_url></item>
