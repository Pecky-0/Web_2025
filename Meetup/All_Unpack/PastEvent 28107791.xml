There will be the Los Three Latin Trio, an open bar. and food for sale. The food and drinks are not very good, and they are pricey. But, if you enjoy museums? You will find it even better with a drink, as you view the works of art around you. The event opens at 5:30 pm.. But, Steve O. can not make there much before 7 pm. So, if you can get there before us and hold a table and some seats? That would help give us some place to meet. If we can't do that. We will be on the left side of the gallery by the band, with signs on our table. They may have it out side in the court yard. So again, we will be by the band.
 &lt;br /&gt; Can't make at 7:00? Then join us anytime until 9:30. The event starts at 5:30 pm.. But, Steve O can not make it any sooner than 7.&amp;nbsp; Call for more info. on carpooling of finding us.
