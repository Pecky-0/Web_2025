Damata's has been eager to have a game event hosted there and they are very accomodating.   The food is great and reasonable.  (We do request at Meetups held at service venues that each person attending at least order one item: food or beverage.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also plenty of free parking.  Should you be coming from outside of Salem, just remember that Damata's is on Bridge St., not the Bridge St. Bypass.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary asks that you please bring your favorite board game to play.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Mary Valentine</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228696090000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224128985000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night at Damata's</name><id>8971732</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226359800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/8971732/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/7/d/global_5891501.jpeg</photo_url></item>
