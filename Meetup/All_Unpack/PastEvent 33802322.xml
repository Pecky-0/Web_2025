<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's been far too long since we've had a meetup, so let's get back in gear by talking about some cool Ruby projects. For starters we have a cool MacRuby project to showcase, but that's just the appetizer. Bring your projects and get ready to show off what you've been up to. This will be a great opportunity to showcase your own work, as well as share knowledge of the ins and outs of Rails. Pizzas, sodas, and beers will be served!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Barron</member_name><member_id>13016442</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317253065000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Rubyists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>route9rubygroup</urlname><id>389347</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Route 9 Ruby Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316187313000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Long Awaited "Next Boston Ruby on Rails Meetup"</name><id>33802322</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317249000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/route9rubygroup/events/33802322/</event_url></item>
