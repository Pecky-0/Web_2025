This program requires you to have 2 things prepared for the meeting: &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; lots of business cards &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a really good elevator speech &lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

In addition, December brings us to our annual gift swap.&amp;nbsp; We will have a Yankee Swap, and we would like you to find something fun and new around your house that is really lovely, but that you are not in love with.&amp;nbsp; Wrap it up prettily, bring it to the Yankee Pedlar, and during our swap, it will find its way into someone else's home.&amp;nbsp; Please do not go out and buy something; the spirit of the swap is to pass on to a sister, something that just isn't "you".&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Allison Biggs</member_name><member_id>10438666</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326977706000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Womens-Business-Owners-Alliance</urlname><id>1525453</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>Women Business Owners Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321927924000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December Breakfast Meeting- Speed Networking</name><id>42000922</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323953100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Womens-Business-Owners-Alliance/events/42000922/</event_url></item>
