&lt;p&gt;This meetup group is not a networking group nor should it be used as a means to seek business contacts or market your products or services.  There are other means to network by joining Chambers of Commerce or similar business associations designed for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group is a self-help group.  Confidentiality of shared information is expected from members of the group in order to allow for open communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot abide by the above for personal or business reasons, please respect these requirements and withdraw your membership from the group.  Otherwise, you will be removed from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to a new beginning in 2013 and we hope to meet once a month as long as active members find our meetings constructive and helpful to the success of their enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your interest and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
