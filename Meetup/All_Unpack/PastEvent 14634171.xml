Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/rpga/downloads/LFR_CharGenGd.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wizards.co...&lt;/a&gt;.  We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINI2-3 &amp;quot;Raven Knights&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;An ancient threat has returned, and the fate of Ravens Bluff hangs in the balance. Only a handful of heroes know the truth. They alone have the opportunity to save the city. But are they up to the challenge? A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Ravens Bluff for characters levels 1-4. This adventure is the third and final part of the three-part Return to Ravens Bluff mini-campaign. It is recommended that you play the mini-campaign adventures in sequential order with the same character, but this is not required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BALD1-1 &amp;quot;Flames of Initiation&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;You have come to the city of Baldur’s Gate in search of adventure and quickly discover the Flaming Fist, one of the largest and most powerful mercenary companies in all Faerûn. To survive in this teeming metropolis, you must prove both your physical and political prowess, and the challenges you will face might turn out to be far more complicated than you imagined. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Baldur’s Gate for characters levels 1-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.  Please have a character pre-made as pre-generated characters will not be available.  Due to issues arising from previous sessions, if you do not come with a pre-made character you will be seated last at a table, as it's unfair to others who RSVP and are ready on time to have to wait and potentially have the adventure not finish in time before the store closes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>11344282</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285973245000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283449290000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms - "Raven Knights" &amp; "Crafts"</name><id>14634171</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285801200000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/14634171/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
