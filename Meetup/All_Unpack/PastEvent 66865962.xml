The clothing is beautiful and the models are in the selection phase. Our concept is ironed out with the photographer and fashion stylists on board. We could use a helping hand, but you must be committed. Makeup, hair, wardrobe assistant, prop/set, and photo assistant needed. Our meeting will begin promptly at 6pm to review details and assign tasks. Here is your chance to build your book. Our location is accessible by T - just get off at Back Bay, Copley or Prudential. You can choose to drive.
