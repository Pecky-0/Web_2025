The hall is absolutely beautiful, and the acoustics are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight's guest conductor, Carlos Kalmar will conduct Mozart's 40th symphony and works by two other composers you've probably never heard of.   For more details about him and the concert, go to &lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-philharmonia-kalmar" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-philharmonia-kalmar" target="_blank"&gt;http://necmusic.edu/n...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm, but let's meet up at 7:30, so the group has a chance to get good seats and socialize before the concert.  We usually end up sitting in the left side of center section just past the overhang, but if the balcony is open, I will always try to sit in the left-middle balcony section, since it affords a good view of the orchestra, and any pianist's hands should there be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Jordan Hall:&lt;br /&gt;The hall is located at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=jordan+Hall,+Boston+MA&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=59.467068,135.263672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.342781,-71.085577&amp;amp;spn=0.006883,0.020599&amp;amp;z=17" target="_blank"&gt;the corner of Huntington and Gainsborough streets&lt;/a&gt;, about a block south of the Symphony T stop on the Green Line.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt; There is currently black canvas covering the entire side of the building and the sidewalk, as I believe the facade is under repair.  The main entrance is reached from Gainsborough Street, under the scaffolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's program will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Osvaldo Golijov's Last Round&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lutoslawski's Concerto for Orchestra             (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItEkj-LsBf4" target="_blank"&gt;listen to 3rd movement here&lt;/a&gt;)  FAIR WARNING: this piece is difficult to listen to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mozart's symphony No. 40                             (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hJf4ZffkoI" target="_blank"&gt;listen to the 1st movement here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will stand in the lobby until 7:45, after which I will join the group, either in the center-left section just past the ovehang or upstairs to the left-middle balcony section (if it's open.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Will</member_name><member_id>7339843</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258763687000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257998663000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Classical Concert Series:  Carlos Kalmar conducts the NEC Philharmonia</name><id>11856522</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258590600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11856522/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/5/global_10915013.jpeg</photo_url></item>
