<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is to be the first in - hopefully - a series of Graphic Design presentation meetups where members teach each other graphic and visual design concepts, and bring to the table their expertise in a variety of programs and topics including, but not limited to Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, InDesign, Flash, Quark XPress, css, typography, general design and color theory, addressing such issues as line weight, tension, rhythm, use of negative space, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever had a question as a designer that you thought was too simple to ask, and spent hours more than you intended on solving something basic (yep, that was a rhetorical question)? This will be a forum where we welcome all your questions on any and all aspects of design, from which we can generate topics for future presentation meetups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic format:&lt;br /&gt;6:30 - 7:00PM Schmooze time&lt;br /&gt;7:00 - 8:30PM&lt;br /&gt;Three half hour presentations including a 10 minute Q&amp;amp;A for each of the following topics (not necessarily in this order):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Sparks&lt;br /&gt;1. Logo Design: how to convert a bitmap image to a vector graphic and other relevant issues related to logos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Hoag&lt;br /&gt;2. Best techniques for optimizing photos for the web in Photoshop, adjusting for differences in color profiles from original photos to monitor profiles, while maintaining best color and preservation of detail in photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruth West&lt;br /&gt;3. How to create seamless backgrounds in Photoshop, animated GIFs, and the differences between JPG, GIF, and PNG files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:30 - 8:50PM Brief 20 minute Q&amp;amp;A session to field general Graphic Design questions and requests for future topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A $5 donation is requested to cover the costs of the projector and food.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Hoag</member_name><member_id>7353473</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244388402000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nohowebdev</urlname><id>540457</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>Northampton Web Developers/ Web Designers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237935779000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Graphic Design - Everything you ever wanted to know (but maybe not all at once)</name><id>10027710</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239229800000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nohowebdev/events/10027710/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/7/global_1616503.jpeg</photo_url></item>
