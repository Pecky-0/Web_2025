They no longer got any radio air-play and ritualistic Dixie Chicks CD burnings became Bible-Belt happenings. Along with some death threats. The group stuck together and while raising kids and making music, this documentary was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, I'll be near the front row holding a Meet-Up sign and after we gather together, we will go to a local pub, which also has sandwiches and burgers on their menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the 1:50 showtime over the 4:40 showtime so that people who have plans for Saturday night might be able to attend as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obligatory review: &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15460889/site/newsweek/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1164048538000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163552996000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing</name><id>5267849</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163875500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5267849/</event_url></item>
