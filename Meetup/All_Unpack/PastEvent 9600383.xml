Three generations of artists bring Andalusian traditions alive with the Orchestra of Tangier, led by the legendary master Ahmed Zaitouni, Said Belcadi, the most promising emerging vocalist of Morocco, and Lotfi Bouchnak, the leading Andalusian musician of Tunisia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MENA Music (which produces this performance) was established in 2006 in New York City by Kazko Kawai in an effort to enhance mutual understanding between the USA and the Arab world through music in the post 9/11 world. The organization is committed to bringing the best musicians from the Middle East (ME) and North Africa (NA) to North America to develop audiences for music from these regions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;NEW!!
