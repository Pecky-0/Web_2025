Introducing meetup at Boston Rock Gym in Woburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goals (besides enjoying climbing) for this series of meetups are:&lt;br /&gt; -Enable those climbers that don't have a partner to find someone to climb with on regular basis&lt;br /&gt; -Allow those who already have partners to climb with different people&lt;br /&gt; -Build a group of people who'd be interested in signing up for climbing classes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To facilitate this, please comment about your climbing level and interests (bouldering, top rope, leading, etc) when RSVPing. Feel free to get in touch with climbers of similar levels and interest prior to the meetup to arrange climbing if you'd like to show up earlier or stay later. If you want to just show up and find a partner that's fine too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes:&lt;br /&gt; -I will typically be at BRG by 7:30p and I will post what I'm wearing the night before so you can find me.&lt;br /&gt; -You'll need to pass a belay test if you've never top roped at BRG before. Call the gym for more info.&lt;br /&gt; -I will generally pick various days of the week and weekends to schedule meetups (preference goes to rainy days) while avoiding Wednesdays (it's ladies night and gets crowded).&lt;br /&gt; -New ideas or suggestions are always welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eugene</member_name><member_id>4701959</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274989206000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274383461000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BRG Tuesday</name><id>13545126</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274830200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/13545126/</event_url></item>
