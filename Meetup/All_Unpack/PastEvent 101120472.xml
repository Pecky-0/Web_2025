&lt;p&gt;Join Primary Source and filmmaker Alex Shear for a special screening of Kokoyakyu: High School Baseball, the first English-language documentary about Japan's national obsession with the sport. The film follows the fortunes of two high school teams as they compete in regional games and then head for the annual "Koshien" tournament. "In Kokoyakyu: High School Baseball, we wanted to capture the unique aspects of Japanese-style baseball and the way Koshien marks a rite of passage for the nation's youth,” says writer/producer Shear. "It's really unlike anything in the United States, and the way Japanese kids approach this rite is also quite a contrast to youth culture—especially sports culture—in America." Q&amp;amp;A with Mr. Shear will follow the screening.&lt;/p&gt;
