These are some of the skills we can share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What techniques do you use in your dreamwork? What techniques would you like to learn? What are your dream goals? Come network with your fellow dreamers, share your dream skills, and learn from others. We can all learn a great deal from each other. Boston Dreamers is a very dynamic and knowledgeable group of dreamers with a much experience navigating the dream realms. The depth and breadth of our knowledge is huge, as are the dream realms themselves. It always amazes me what expertise we have among our members and what wisdom we share with each other at our meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.&amp;quot; - William Blake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payment is $10 and can be made online or in person.
