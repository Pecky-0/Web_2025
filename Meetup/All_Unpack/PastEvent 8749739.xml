If you arrive early-please go to the smaller dog section as our group tends to separate in the larger dog play area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It'll be at 10:00 am since that seems to be working for most people.  See you there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember-I'll have goodie bags for the dogs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Terri &amp;amp; Simon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancellation procedure: If it is raining, too hot, too cold, etc. a cancellation notice will be sent via email and posted on the meetup website 2 hours prior to the meetup time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Meetup.com charges each group a $15 a month meetup fee. This is a GROUP fee and if not paid, our Boston French Bulldog meetups, would not exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is in charge of paying this fee every month. It would be greatly appreciated if at each meetup, each member can submit a donation that goes towards the monthly $15 fee. Give $1, give $10. If at the end of the meetup, the organizer has not collected enough to meet the $15, she will pay the difference. If she receives more than $15, the extra would go towards the next meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the smaller fenced in area..see my pic in my profile</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223990722000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221318848000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston French Bulldog October Meetup</name><id>8749739</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223733600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/8749739/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/1/global_381217.jpeg</photo_url></item>
