I will e talking about the importance of inner peace and how cleaning up your internal atmosphere helps to clean up our external world.  How can we think the world can be peaceful if we as individuals are fighting inside with ourselves and each other?  Lets get real now, being peaceful can be challenging but well worth the effort.  I would love to share what I have learned through meditation about living in peace and giving out peace on a daily and moment to moment basis.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184542607000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184193224000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar : Peace starts with you. $5 for meetup members</name><id>6009623</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184369400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/6009623/</event_url></item>
