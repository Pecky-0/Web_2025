This is the perfect weekend for your first time whitewater experience.  We will run the NH section of the Saco River.   Guide/Instructors will be Wedeln members with kayak instruction experience.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day will start with some basic paddling and safety instruction, progress to some kayak games to work on skills, then we head down some Class I and Class II rapids.  There will be long stretches of flat water between rapids - this will create an easy pace to work on your technique in slow water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a whitewater trip designed to teach basic whitewater skills - not a party trip or a float trip.  Trip leader may limit participation or require portages around some obstacles based on water level and ability.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Bring:  lunch, water, dry bag with warm clothes.   No cotton - dress to get wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to sign up:  email Tom Lane (tom_lane@harvard.edu) AND add your name to the meetup event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the costs?  No cost for the actual instruction! Guests pay $40 for weekend accommodation.  If you do not have a boat Tom has arranged $20 deal through a local outfitter - If you would like to rent a boat please check this meetup later for details.  Bring your own lunch and snacks.  We may pitch in for dinner but this will be optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have your own kayak (any type) bring it.  If you can get a whitewater boat that is the best BUT this trip will be OK for recreational, sea and sit-on-top kayaks.
