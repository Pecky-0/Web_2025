There's parking on Forsyth, Parker, and Hemenway or (if you are lucky) along Huntington Ave.  We'll meet up right in the Marino Center, its a can't miss building with a glass facade and an Au Bon Pain and Bolocco downstairs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a ton of seating in an open area once you walk in.  We'll be there.  If you are going to be late though please give a ring to the number listed as we'll probably move to a nicer local on campus depending how many people we get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry though, there's a UNOs right down the block for our usual after improv dinner and dessert and there are some other options too if we feel adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions? Let me know.  I hope you are all doing great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason J.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a wacky face on as the norm!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227920706000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226954946000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Improv Northeastern Stylin Part II</name><id>9180293</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227227400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/9180293/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
