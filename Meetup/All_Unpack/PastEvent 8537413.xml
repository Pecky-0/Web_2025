Are you feeling uncommonly horizontal?  Well, we can help!  Join us this Friday for a Weekend Warmup, Friday night blast at Metro Rock!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be hanging at the table around 7pm to orient any new folks.  Come up and introduce yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't climbed at Metro Rock before, you'll need to pass their easy belay test.  Well, it's easy if you know how to belay.  If you don't know how to belay, they also offer a class, but be sure to call ahead to make sure they can offer the class on Friday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym is T accessible: go to Wellington station on the orange line, and call them for a shuttle ride.  Details on that (and driving directions) at their website:  &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Matthew&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the tall, skinny caucasian fellow with short brown hair and rock shoes</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219014294000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218656036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Flights</name><id>8537413</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218841200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8537413/</event_url></item>
