Here it is.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Saturday,  June 18th at 10AM, we'll meet outside Cupcake Charlie's on the Plymouth  waterfront (6 Town Wharf, Plymouth).  There is paid and free parking in  the area, a playground, many wonderful historical spots, and of course,  the waterfront, for us to photograph.  Like our foray into Chinatown,  it will be what we make&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As  was the case on our last photowalk, models will have to come dressed  with hair and make-up the way they want to be photographed.  Unlike Mike  &amp;amp; Pat's Great Model Shoots, we won't have those resources available  to us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is no charge for this photowalk.  However, we will  more than likely find someplace to sit and have a meal together like we  did last time, so there is the cost of lunch.  And of course, there is  Cupcake Charlie's (which is open from 11AM-6PM) with their fine cupcake  and frosting shot offerings! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am also working on organizing another photowalk in July, more details to come! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If  you have any questions, feel free to post them here, or send me a  message.  Also, please feel free to pass along this information to  anyone you think might enjoy a fun day of photography &amp;amp; friendship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308511067000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306872125000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Photowalk of the Plymouth Waterfront</name><id>20402161</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308405600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/20402161/</event_url></item>
