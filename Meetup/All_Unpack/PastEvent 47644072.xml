<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Time for another fast-paced hike. &amp;nbsp;Instead of heading to the gym, this fast-paced walk is aimed to get our heart rate going. &amp;nbsp;You should be able to walk just short of jogging pace for 3hours to join this meet up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is offered to both "Hike the Medford Fells" and the "Random Group of Hikers" with 4 spots for sign up for each group (for a total of 9 hikers). &amp;nbsp;Please only sign up for this event once, even if you are a member of both meet up groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to walk the Skyline trail (approx 7.5mi) in under 2hours. &amp;nbsp;Bring 2.5hours of your time with you in case we are slower due to the weather and ground conditions. &amp;nbsp;Also, as we may be dealing with frozen ground and ice, you MUST bring microspikes or sth. similar. &amp;nbsp;The trail has plenty of rocks that may be slippery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring something to drink (and possibly eat). To clarify: this is a workout, not a conversational meetup. Please do NOT sign up for this hike if you are unable to walk just short of jogging pace for 3hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be leaving the parking lot at 10:05am and plan to return to the parking lot by 12:05pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do NOT join this meet up if you do not jog/run regularly and are confident that you can walk at a fast pace for a few hours. &amp;nbsp;This is a fast-paced hike. &amp;nbsp;No break scheduled during this loop hike. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to our hike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
