&lt;p&gt;It sure has been while since we ALL got together. Let's meet on August 2nd but let's gather at the Parker House (60 School St, Boston), inside Parker's Bar -- a couple of weeks before our big book launch celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll bring a copy of one of the final proof copies of the book so you'll get to see a copy before the big event. Just to let you all know... thus far... the book or sections of the book have been reviewed/scrutinized by a professional publishing consultant in Cambridge, and a developmental editor in LA with a total of more than 40 years of experience in the publishing business, by one of Time magazine's Most Influential People and Thinkers in the world, by one of the most sought after Senior Executive Administrative Assistants, a Harvard scientist, a Rhode Scholar to Oxford and member of the American Philosophical Society, and by a celebrated young Professor of Creative Writing from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, MA with a distinguished background from UC Berkeley and Harvard. And, to our delight and well beyond our wildest imagination, the book has received rave reviews from all of the above!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I hope to see you ALL at the Parker's Bar -- located upstairs -- inside the Parker House (60 School St. Boston) for a small and private celebration of the book finally becoming a reality. I am aim/hoping that we'll be able to secure the "King Arthur-esque" round table that overlooks the lobby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you plan to make it or not, Please RSVP. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
