It's directed by Noah Baumbach, who has done interesting complex work with characters in the past (The Squid and The Whale comes to mind).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm wondering how Baumbach handles Ben Stiller, who is the challenged main character of the movie.  See the description below.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it's the last minute,  but if we can get 4 people to commit to attendance, that will be terrific.  After we'll probably go to Tommy Doyle's, where we all know the menu and it's not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Currently the movie is scheduled to begin at 4:20.  I will check Saturday morning and update with the time.  The Kendall has been known to make changes at the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the blurb at the Kendall website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greenberg brings actor Ben Stiller together with Academy Award-nominated writer/director Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) to tell the funny and moving tale of Roger Greenberg (Stiller). Single, fortyish and at a crossroads in his life, he finds himself in Los Angeles, house-sitting for six weeks for his more successful/married-with-children brother. In search of a place to restart his life, Greenberg tries to reconnect with old friends including his former bandmate Ivan (Rhys Ifans). But old friends aren’t necessarily still best friends, and Greenberg soon finds himself spending more and more time with his brother’s personal assistant Florence (Greta Gerwig), an aspiring singer and also something of a lost soul. Despite his best attempts not to be drawn in, Greenberg and Florence manage to forge a connection, and Greenberg realizes he may at last have found a reason to be happy. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Before the movie, I'll be in the lobby starting about 4:00 - behind the food stand, next to the mustard and ketchup.  After the movie, I'll be in the front right of the auditorium.  Looking forward to seeing you there.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271271722000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greenberg</name><id>13183065</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271535300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/13183065/</event_url></item>
