For directions or if you have questions, call Stephen (me) at 508-410-3172 or Marie at 508-269-6551. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's another pond side bbq!!! Hopefully we'll have the weather on our side this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's event will be at a beautiful pond right over the Leicester line in Spencer (only about 15/20 minutes from Worcester) It's a private home with a deck, grill and small dock that goes right into the water. There's possibility of a party boat and kayaks.. but the guarantee of a good time! :) You can bring bbq-able items like fruit, vegetables, kabobs, veggie burgers/veg dogs etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to bring a bathing suit! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling will be available as always, just contact me in advance so it can be coordinated. Also try to RSVP as early as possible for this one so we can prepare for enough people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186506301000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183313338000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp August Meetup</name><id>5960739</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186333200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/5960739/</event_url></item>
