&lt;p&gt;Melrose is home to one of the most distinctive performance centers on the North Shore. The gray granite building, located at 590 Main Street, is adjacent to the Central Fire Station and City Hall. Its construction was watched with much interest, and favorable comments were made on the simple yet dignified interior and exterior of the building. The building was dedicated on Dec. 14, 1912 in patriotic remembrance of the brave soldiers and sailors of the Civil War. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Memorial Hall offers a splendid setting for social, artistic, cultural, and political events. With a seating capacity of 800, the main auditorium houses a stage measuring 30' x 40', dressing rooms, and a public address system. A grand organ, dedicated in 1919 as a memorial to the World War I veterans, and similar in construction and musical expression to an organ in the Municipal Building in Portland, Maine, is located at the rear of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commuter rail station Melrose Cedar Park is about a 1/2 mile away.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a meetup button/will give out Cell Phone # the night before and will email again Friday afternoon</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kirk, "Rear Admiral"</member_name><member_id>4863083</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366075276000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365607557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beatlejuice band in Melrose Friday 4/12</name><id>113653372</id><headcount>4</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365807600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/113653372/</event_url></item>
