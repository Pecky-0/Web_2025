At this size, it is a significant open space, and &amp;quot;perhaps the largest municipally-owned park inside the loop of Route 128.&amp;quot; The park covers a ridge which features two significant peaks. At 485 feet above sea level, the higher of the two is the second highest point in the vicinity of Boston, only the Great Blue Hill stands taller. This peak has been called Great Prospect, but is more often referred to as Big Prospect, while its smaller associate, which stands at 435 feet, is known as Little Prospect. Both peaks provide excellent views of the Boston basin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the park's parking lot at 10:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch afterwards at&lt;br /&gt;Elephant Walk (Cambodian and French cooking)&lt;br /&gt;663 Main Street&lt;br /&gt;Waltham, MA 02451&lt;br /&gt;781.899.2244&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218465308000</updated><rating><average>4.55999994278</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215440484000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Prospect Hill park, Waltham</name><id>8291215</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218292200000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/8291215/</event_url></item>
