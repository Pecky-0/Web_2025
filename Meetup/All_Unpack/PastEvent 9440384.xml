Those attending will have an opportunity to hear the Officiator share stories of spiritual growth and insight from practicing the exercises of Eckankar.   All participants will have an opportunity to learn to sing HU, a love song to God.     It can help relieve the worries and concerns of your day.  A spiritually-charged word, it is gift of love from God.   Participants will also have a chance to share their stories and insights if they would like.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Worship Service people are invited to join in fellowship along with light snacks and beverages.  There is the opportunity to join others to discuss the topics in greater detail as well as to sign up for advanced spiritual study.
