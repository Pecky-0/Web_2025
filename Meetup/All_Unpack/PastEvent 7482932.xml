Judging by the comments of our members and what the Organizers have been able to learn from other sources, that status is well deserved. Atmosphere, service and most importantly, food, all rate high marks here, with dishes such as cranberry mango chicken, herb-crusted haddock and filet mignon served in several dining rooms on two floors; the rooms featuring fireplaces, book-lined shelves and the warm tones of real wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for an evening that promises to &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; a memorable one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price Range:&lt;/b&gt; Dinner entrees range from $12.95 (pasta primavera, harvest ravioli) to $32.95 (bone-in &amp;quot;Captain's cut&amp;quot; of prime rib), with a slight majority of entrees priced under $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wheelchair Access&lt;/b&gt;: Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, March 18 @ 7:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benjamin's Restaurant &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;508-824-6313&lt;br /&gt;698 Bay St., Taunton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions from points North (Boston, Braintree):&lt;/b&gt; Take Route 24 South to Route 495 North.
