<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the regular, monthly meetup for the New Hampshire Ruby Users Group.  This month, we have New Hampshire's newest resident rubyist, Peter Jackson, presenting &amp;quot;Introduction to (Geo)Spatial Programming&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location-based applications are everywhere, yet most modern Rubyists haven't ventured far beyond superimposing a few locations on a Google Map. In this talk, the Rubyist will learn about the many spatial programming possibilities within the Ruby landscape, including non-location-based applications, geographic applications using custom imagery, answering difficult questions using spatial queries, Moving Beyond the Dot-On-The-Map, and how to get started with Geospatial Programming today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Peter Jackson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Jackson is Managing Director at Intridea. He has been building and delivering web and mobile-based solutions since 1995. His technical passions include geospatial programming, the VoteFu Rails plug-in, anything to do with jQuery, and the fanatical removal of cruft. Find him on twitter at @peteonrails or read his blog: &lt;a href="http://blog.peteonrails.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://blog.peteonrai...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About NHRuby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're a group of people who are enthusiasts of the Ruby programming language and the Ruby on Rails web development framework. We range from casual hobbyists to professional software developers. We are also affiliated with the Greater New Hampshire Linux User Group (GNHLUG), which supports the spread of UN*X and Open Source Software throughout New Hampshire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to NH-ICC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find detailed directions to the NH-ICC at &lt;a href="http://www.nh-icc.org/about-nh-icc/directions/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nh-icc.org...&lt;/a&gt; or use Google Maps &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=75+Rochester+Avenue+Portsmouth+NH" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Main conference room to the left of reception.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>nap</member_name><member_id>6144459</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Turnbull</member_name><member_id>13167741</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289940698000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ruby programmers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhruby</urlname><id>885450</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The NH Ruby and Rails Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286826154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHRuby Meeting: (Geo)Spatial Programming</name><id>lvkqpynpbtb</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289865600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhruby/events/15074630/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/f/global_4005199.jpeg</photo_url></item>
