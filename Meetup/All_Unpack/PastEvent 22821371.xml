&lt;p&gt;starting at Mount Osceola Trailhead Back to here hike 3.20 mi/2 hr 41 min/+2016 ft on the Mount Osceola Trail The trail leaves Tripoli Rd. and climbs moderately with somewhat rocky footing, going east across the south slope of Breadtray Ridge. It begins to climb by switchbacks toward the ridge top, and the footing improves. A ledge on the left offers a view of Sandwich Mountain, and it crosses a small brook (unreliable). The trail resumes its switchbacks, gains the summit ridge and turns right, and soon reaches the summit ledge, with excellent views. A good outlook to the north can be obtained from a small ledge on a short side path, which begins at the older fire tower site that is located in the woods just to the west of the open ledge. to Mt Osceola Totals Distance 3.20 mi Time 2 hr 41 min Elev Gain +2180 ft Elev Loss -164 ft Elev Change +2016 ft Driving Directions Show in Google Earth Download to GPS Back to here hike 1.00 mi/40 min/-150 ft on the Mount Osceola Trail The trail then turns left and descends from the summit, alternating flat stretches with steep, rocky descents.
