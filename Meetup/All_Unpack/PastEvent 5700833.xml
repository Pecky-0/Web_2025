Meet at the flag pole on the Green at 5:30 for a slow-paced bicycle ride through New Haven streets. The ride ranges from 30 minutes to over an hour depending on weather and usually ends at a house party or a New Haven spot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ride starts promptly at 6pm, so don't be late!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYOB and a dish or snack for the potluck party afterwards, all are invited. If you bring jello, perhaps it's not a good idea to put it in your backpack without a lid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critical Mass is not an organization, it's an unorganized coincidence. It's a movement ... of bicycles, &lt;a href="http://www.elmcitycycling.org/safety/criticalmasssafety" target="_blank"&gt;in the streets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for me on my bright red Schwinn 3-speed with the chrome fenders...and I have a matching red helmet :)&lt;br /&gt;Your contact is Eric, and is reachable at: 860-214.936 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm setting this up on MONDAY so you'll have plenty of time to check your tires and find some bright clothing/blinky lights!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.elmcitycycling.org/photos/pastevents/miscfun/elm_city_cycling_small.jpg,6" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541328000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177356656000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Critical Mass Bicycle Ride, 5:30pm at the flagpole on the Green!</name><id>5700833</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177709400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5700833/</event_url></item>
