I have a bunch of the vouchers and plan to use this Sunday.  We will meet at the BEAR PEAK SIDE at 9:30pm - please do not gone to the main Attitash side, it is too difficult to find meetup people there.  I have enough vouchers for at least 12 people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will hit the main Bear Peak quad for runs down wide open cruisers and break for lunch at 12:30pm.  The Superbowl kickoff is 6:30pm so I will try to get off the mountain before 3pm so I can get back to Boston with time to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attitash is famous for its great trail system, top notch grooming and amazing snowmaking.  It is also famous for large Saturday crowds which is why you will see me there on Sundays :)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be able to car pool - I have a full car and will spend the weekend up north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>go to the Bear Peak Entrance,  call my cell 617-596-5579</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265726384000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265156695000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Attitash 2 for 1 Sunday!</name><id>12501496</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265553000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak/events/12501496/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/b/global_12925963.jpeg</photo_url></item>
