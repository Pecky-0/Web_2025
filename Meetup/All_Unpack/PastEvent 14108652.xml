Washington 2 weeks later.  We are doing about 1/2 the elevation gain of Washington and there are many hills to climb.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Moderate/Advanced hikers ONLY, this hike will be similar to previous hikes: Cannon, Jackson/Pierce and Moosilauke in elevation gain.  If you are unsure about your being ready for Mt. Washington, you should be able to complete this hike without difficulty while feeling like you have energy to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See elevation graphic by &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~pbakwin/fkt/BHSky.gif" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;CLICKING HERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/blueHills.gif" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a large photo of the trail (we are taking the blue trail starting at the Trailside Museum on route 138 to Shea Rink on the right side of the map).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at Shea Rink (which will be the end of the hike) and shuttle some cars to the Trailside Museum where this hike will begin. We can figure out the specifics later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure this hike taking 4-5 hours, maybe a little less based on how quick we are moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have already RSVP'd on the Blue Hills Hiking Group then you do not need to RSVP here.
