<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the weekly activities being offered in the Fitchburg area as part of the Friends In Motion meetup. 7 people from that group have signed up for this activity so far.  Anyone can join us to have fun while being outdoors and burning calories. We play on a sand court and all levels of experience are welcome. Totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We will be following the rules and keeping score, but having fun and learning will be more important than winning. We work on trying to keeping the volley going, rather than trying to end the volley. So, bring your friends and teens, your drinks to keep cool and hydrated and insect repellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you park in the upper parking lot the court is located behind a structure in the middle of the field. If you park in the lower parking lot by the playground, walk past the playground along the track and look to your left until you see the court .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Todd M.
