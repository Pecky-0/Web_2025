Through the power of a single intention, healing, the group will learn energy healing modalities for relief, healing &amp;amp; improvement in various areas of their life. We will channel the power of many hearts and many minds into one laser beam of focused thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will do group energy work in a free-form round robbin. Everyone will do work, receive work, and learn work from everyone present. It will be a cornucopia of energy work. LET THE VIBES FLOW!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have a moment of meditation and do some very basic work with the breath. Proper breathing is vital to one's capacity to connect with the Source of healing and consciously direct and work with energy. (Note: &lt;b&gt;No shoes in the meeting space&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimum # of participants needed: &lt;b&gt;Unlimited&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Rear entrance - up the stairs.
