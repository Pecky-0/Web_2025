I have never been, but I've checked out their website. Feel free to share if you have been. I'm going to say we'll meet at noon at the main entrance, but I have not been. So I have posted my cell phone number as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winetasting is $9 and gets you a souvenir glass. I'm thinking it'd be fun to take a bottle of wine on the hayride if they'll allow you to do that. They also have donuts for sale, coffee, apples, all nice fall things. So let's hope it's a nice fall day :) Check out their website if you want to know more. &lt;a href="http://www.rosedale1920.com/"&gt;http://www.rosedale1920.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jocelyn</member_name><member_id>8761972</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352250225000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Smiling Happy Faces</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford</urlname><id>1498492</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>Eat, Laugh, and Be Merry in West Hartford</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350229794000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fall Afternoon at Rosedale Farm and Vineyards - Winetasting, Corn Maze, Hayride</name><id>86921852</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350748800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Eat-Laugh-and-Be-Merry-in-West-Hartford/events/86921852/</event_url></item>
