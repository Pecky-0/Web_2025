We will start off on water first, followed by a walk to Emma’s Pizza for lunch.  After lunch, anyone interested can walk along the beautiful Charles River and over to the Esplanade.  We will meet at the Cambridge location of  Charles River Canoe and Kayak.  See the Boston skyline and the Esplanade, as well as other nearby landmarks like the Zakim Bridge, M.I.T., the Museum of Science, and Boston University from the water. We will paddle leisurely for 1.5-2 hours, and then go to lunch afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your RSVP, please indicate whether you are interested in Kayaking or Canoeing, and whether you would like to share a boat or paddle solo.  This will help me coordinate the rentals.  This location is very close to the Kendall Square T-Station on the Red Line.  Reduced rate parking is available at the Kendall Square South Garage. Please bring cash to make it easier to coordinate payment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rental Price is per boat and includes life jackets -&lt;br /&gt;Single Kayak - $15/hr&lt;br /&gt;Double Kayak - $18/hr&lt;br /&gt;Electric Single Kayak - $20/hr&lt;br /&gt;Quad Kayak - $22/hr&lt;br /&gt;Canoe seating 2-3 adults - $16/hr&lt;br /&gt;Large Canoe seating 4-5 adults - $24/hr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Validated Parking at the reduced rate of $1 per hour for the first three hours and $7 for longer than three hours is available at the Kendall Square South Garage. &lt;a href="http://www.pilgrimparking.com/facilities/kendall_sq/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pilgrimpar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed directions to the Charles River Canoe and Kayak are available on the website at &lt;a href="http://www.paddleboston.com/kendall/directions.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.paddlebost...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date:  Saturday 8/28 at 11am&lt;br /&gt;Location:  Cambridge Location of Charles River Canoe and Kayak&lt;br /&gt;500 Broad Canal Street*, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142&lt;br /&gt;* Broad Canal Street is a private way that does not appear on most maps.&lt;br /&gt;Address of Rental Center for GPS: 370 3rd Street, Cambridge, and turn right.&lt;br /&gt;Address of Parking Garage for GPS: 350 Kendall Street, Cambridge.&lt;br /&gt;Latitude N 42° 21.762'; Longitude W 71° 04.951'&lt;br /&gt;(617) 492-0941&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma’s Pizza at 40 Hampshire Street, Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA, 617-864-8534&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing an Alaska baseball cap</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Catherine</member_name><member_id>9203184</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283113902000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281387062000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>One if by Land, Two if by Sea</name><id>14370039</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283007600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/14370039/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/b/c/global_17079772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
