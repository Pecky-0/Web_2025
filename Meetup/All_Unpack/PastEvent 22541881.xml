It's on the borderline between Holyoke and Springfield, MA. You and your family are welcome to attend! This will be an open, bring a dish to pass and have some grilled stuff MeetUp. We will probably take a small amount of time to check in with one another and introduce ourselves, but this is a wide open evening for relaxation and connection in community, right down by the Connecticut River. We will meet at the Jones Ferry Boathouse directly off Rte 5 by the Sisters of Mercy Hospital in Holyoke, MA (plenty of parking) and then walk in to the conservation property.
