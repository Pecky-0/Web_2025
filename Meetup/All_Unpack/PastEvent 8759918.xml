<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi, please join us for a theatrical evening as we watch a live performance of &amp;quot;I Never Sang for My Father&amp;quot;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This highly praised drama, written by the American author of “Tea and Sympathy” and “Silent Night, Lonely Night,” was an immediate critical success when first produced in 1968. Present action and memory are juxtaposed in a tense battle of wills as young middle-aged teacher Gene Garrison struggles with the newly imposed burden of caring for his aged parents Margaret and Tom. Family members who have long been virtual strangers to one another are suddenly thrust together, conflicts are magnified – and Gene’s longtime combative relationship with his cantankerous, judgmental father takes center stage.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet outside the theater at 6:30 pm, please don't be late because if you show up after 7 they will not let you in until intermission. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at:603-509-2907 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be joined by the &amp;quot;Trailblazers&amp;quot; meetup group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223827569000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
