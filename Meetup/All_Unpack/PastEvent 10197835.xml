<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Looks like Saturday morning's weather could be decent enough to meet for some tennis.  It was a long winter (and not so good spring so far) but it will be nice to finally get outside and play. This will my first time out (and possibly yours also) so it may not be unreasonable to think of this as a warmup / get loose event as we start the season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be great to see members from last year's group but new members are encouraged to join us, too.  This is an informal group with players of all ability levels.  Yes, it's about tennis but it's also about meeting up with other people so don't hesitate to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the event that we find the courts being used by some other group (ie. Conard tennis team), plan to detour over to Wolcott Park courts.  The park is only a few blocks away off New Britain Ave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully we'll have a nice turnout of new and old friends.  Bring water and new balls, if you have some.&lt;br /&gt;I can be reached at 860-559-7983 if you have questions or comments.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jim&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue Nike Hat - Meet near the center bleachers</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240240103000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239888991000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis in West Hartford </name><id>10197835</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240059600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/10197835/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_2940738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
