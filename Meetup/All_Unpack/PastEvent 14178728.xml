From this perspective, we experience the &amp;quot;Dreaming&lt;br /&gt;Process&amp;quot; in a myriad of ways; through our nighttime dreams as well as the&lt;br /&gt;organic flow of waking experience.  Please join Matt Stella in learning some&lt;br /&gt;beginning tools to following &amp;quot;the Dreaming&amp;quot;. When we approach all of our&lt;br /&gt;experiences as dreams, then problems and conflicts transform, and life&lt;br /&gt;becomes creative and meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIO:&lt;br /&gt;Matt Stella, LICSW, Dipl.PW is a psychotherapist, group facilitator, and&lt;br /&gt;Process Work Diplomate, holding a Masters in Process Work from the Process&lt;br /&gt;Work Institute in Portland, OR.
