Join us in exploration of new science of healing and new consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who have experienced trauma are often scared of what is going on with them and are afraid that they have been changed permanently. That is definitely not so.  We will continue this time with specific applications that can be used by anyone who want to experience a palpable change in how they are feeling right now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every meetup we witness first hand demonstration of just how dramatically effective energetic re-integration techniques are can be in cases of profound emotional distress, depression and anxiety  I want to stress to all of you that no matter what the source or the intensity of your distress, these same methods will work just as successfully for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;Are your ready to discover how to love and embrace all who you are beyond time and form, beyond what has happened or is happening?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you been longing to re-connect with your unique self and love yourself just as you are?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this event&lt;br /&gt;You will be learning how to transform with ease even the most pronounced traumas in a way that you never imagined possible by re-building your soul’s home – the energetic membrane around your energy field.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will continue exploring how anxiety and depression are manifestation of energy loss and displacement, as we practice techniques to realign and recover your energy and restoring your energetic container – your soul’s home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the energetic membrane of your energy field is activated, then just as in cellular communications, nature and the universe take over, your mind gets a break, and being and healing become virtually effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Unfortunately millions of people have no choice but to try to live in the debilitating state of discomfort that results from energetic misalignment. You certainly do not need to be one of them. I am inviting you to embark on an exciting journey to the new anxiety and trauma-free you. Let us get started. Join us for a highly experiential presentation, live demonstration and personal practices. Warm welcome to everyone!
