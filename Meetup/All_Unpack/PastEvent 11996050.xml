The event is fast approaching and tickets are selling... If you're planning to go and don't have a ticket, please call Christine  (888-368-8880) and let me know you've done so. Send me your email address through the email link in Meetup (not the message board). I don't have all the names of people who bought their tickets, and I'd like a way to send everyone my cell phone number and last-minute updates privately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the wine tower in the inside lobby.  It's a huge, tall display where they'll be raffling off cases of wine -- yes, you could take home a couple of cases, along with that Reidel glass! I'll have a sign in the area. I may be going to one of the seminars before the event, but I'll make sure the sign is there if I get delayed.  Meetup also has added a new name tag label service, so I'll have name tags, too.  This years' process has been streamlined.  If you already have your ticket you can just show it at the door and move through to the inside lobby and coat check area.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another perk: the state liquor commission offers discounts on any wine that you order at the event (half cases? cases? Christine isn't sure.) Vendors will give you labels for the wines you like. You stick the labels on an order form and complete the order on your way out, and indicate which store to ship it to. So here's a chance to stock up. (I wish I had known that in advance last year.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on the 28th.  ~lynn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/18:  Good news:  we can continue to offer tickets until they're sold.  Christine suggests buying by early January to make sure you receive your ticket(s) in time.  Remember to register and let me know if/when you buy.  Everyone who bought tickets should have received them.  Let me know if you did not.   Christine's number: 888-368-8880.  ~lynn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  We still have tickets available; I'll leave this open for another week.  I urge you to register this week if you're interested.  Christine said it's fine to call her directly to purchase with a credit card, and she'll mail your ticket directly.  Please register and let me know if you do, so I can keep an accurate count.  Thanks, ~lynn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;The 7th annual Winter Wine Spectacular is coming up in January: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://nh.easterseals.com/site/Calendar?view=Detail&amp;amp;id=28981" target="_blank"&gt;http://nh.easterseals...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we can pull a group together, we'll get a break on the ticket price. &lt;br /&gt;Regular price $60 &lt;br /&gt;10-19 people: $55 &lt;br /&gt;19+ people: $50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went last year -- it was great fun. And you get a Reidel glass to take home .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 25: I spoke with Christine Hardy at Easter Seals again today. She's willing to hold 20 tickets aside for us for a while (until sellout gets closer). They always sell out by Christmas, so we need to buy soon, now that the media blitz has started. You can pay the $50 now; however, if we don't reach 20, you'll have to pay an additional $5 at the door to get your ticket. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the payment options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Write a check to Easter Seals (so you get the tax write-off) and mail it to *me*; I'll drop them off when I get a bunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Call Christine to pay by credit card. NOTE to FANs:  tell Christine that you're part of the &lt;b&gt;wine lover's meetup&lt;/b&gt; group &amp;amp; mention my name to get the discount.  I organized this for that meetup and opened it to this one.  It'll be fun to get both groups together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm moving the deadline to register closer &lt;b&gt;(Dec 8)&lt;/b&gt; to allow time for mailing checks. If you're considering going, please register and pay on time to decrease chances that Christine will sell our tickets before we buy them all.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really fun -- and flavorful -- event... NH's big wine event of the year. Ya gotta be there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll email the registered people with my address and phone number, and we'll finalize plans for meeting up and distributing tickets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~lynn&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a  sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lynn l</member_name><member_id>8074974</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264893221000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259721872000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Wine Spectacular</name><id>11996050</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264719600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/11996050/</event_url></item>
