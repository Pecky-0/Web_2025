<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Attachment theory was first developed in researching a child's behavior with a care giver.  Scientists found 3 broad categories of behaviors on how a child dealt with separation from a caregiver. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In more recent decades, research has explored how these working models of behavior may influence our romantic relationships as adults. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this event, we explore the topic with a smaller group with more in depth discussions.  This will be a hosted pot luck dinner. We'll also explore some of the issues that arise with relationships between romantic partners from different categories.    This will be a mix of a quiz,  presentations and discussion.  We will look into how one can determine what attachment style a potential partner has.  Some of the materiel comes from a recent book on the subject: Attached, by Levine &amp; Heller.  I'll be drawing information from other articles, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The address for the potluck will be emailed to the participants.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim B</member_name><member_id>1113365</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305554680000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><why>because it is in our nature....</why><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304260892000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Attached?</name><id>17498111</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304721000000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/17498111/</event_url></item>
