Courteous, honest, hardworking, and impenetrable, Franklin Hata, a  Japanese man of Korean birth, is careful to never overstep his bounds  and to make his neighbors comfortable in his presence. He keeps his  garden well tended, bids his customers good-bye at the doorway of his  medical supply shop, ignores the taunts of local boys. Yet as his story  unfolds, precipitated by the small events that take place around him, we  see his life begin to unravel. We learn of an adopted daughter, who has  vanished from his life, a romantic relationship gone sour; a minor  conflagration that threatens the foundation of the life he has built.  Gradually, we discover the mystery that has shaped the core of his  being, his terrible, forbidden love for a young Korean comfort woman  when he served as a medic in the Japanese army during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Community Room, downstairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annie</member_name><member_id>1543974</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312244296000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paradisecityreaders</urlname><id>1404829</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Paradise City Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302625495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August: A Gesture Life, Chang-rae Lee</name><id>17277556</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1312239600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paradisecityreaders/events/17277556/</event_url></item>
