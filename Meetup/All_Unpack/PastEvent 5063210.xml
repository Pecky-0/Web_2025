The whole shore line in  mostly undevelpoed and motor boats are kept to a very slow speed! A wonderful way to spend the day!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Rescheduled after rain cancellation!! Come join us!!! &lt;br /&gt;Weather is not looking good!! Rain will cancel! Keep an eye on the sky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From Winsted, go west on rt.44 and turn left onto rt.263 at the edge of town. Go 4.5 miles through Winchester Center and as rt.263 curves left, go straight onto West Rd. at the Winchester Lake sign. Go 0.6 mile to the boat access on the right!  Do not follow the boat signs for Highland lake traveling up rt.263!! It gets confusing so check with mapquest if needed!&lt;br /&gt;   Lets meet up at the boat ramp at 11:00!!&lt;br /&gt;        See ya there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1154824880000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lake Winchester, Winchester ct.</name><id>5063210</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1157382000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5063210/</event_url></item>
