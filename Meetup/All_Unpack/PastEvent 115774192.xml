&lt;p&gt;Trip Summary &lt;br /&gt;

 We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. This trip isn't for you if you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us (it is okay if you go up to next junction and wait for the group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this moderate pace (~1.5 MPH) hike we will hike about 5.5 miles and climb about 830 feet. It should take an average hiker about 2 hours 45 minutes to complete this trip (this does not include time for rest breaks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is considered to be beginner/intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please have comfortable/supportive footwear - hiking boots are preferred, but sneakers are acceptable, water and snack(s).&lt;/p&gt;
