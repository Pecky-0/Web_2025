If you have an idea for a new project or questions about an existing one, this is an excellent time to bring them up. We will be discussing our current projects and deciding if we will continue to run them and will also work on some new projects as well. This will be a very informative event for all who attend. Lunch will be provided, so please rsvp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks - see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in the conference room by the back entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess Lonczewski</member_name><member_id>7983178</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234395115000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233070188000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South Windsor Jaycees February Membership Meetup</name><id>9611687</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233415800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/9611687/</event_url></item>
