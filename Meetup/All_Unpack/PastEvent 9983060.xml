I did this with them last year. We had a blast. If we fly in formation, maybe we can buzz the tower. I'm not certain, but maybe we'll get lucky enough for an escort as well.&lt;br /&gt;Here's what they are saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of our most ambitious fly-in events! With such an indescribable reaction from NEPG members, the FAA, and the City Of Chicago last year, we AGAIN invite you to join us as we visit this historic field on the lake in Chicago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to meet at noon at the FBO, which means a somewhat early departure for many of us, but well worth it! We'll stroll into town and visit the Town Hall, maybe even meeting the inculpable Mayor-For-Life Richard J. Daley!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following that, join us for our fly-in rampside barbecue at O'Hare (KORD). This is a great opportunity to practice touch-and-goes as you can probably get in 3 or 4 in a row without leaving ground effect thanks to the 13,000 foot RWY14R/32L!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will truly be an experience never to forget! Hope to see you there&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239747018000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237411082000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Formation Flight to Historic Meigs Field.
