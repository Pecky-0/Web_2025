We can put our name in for a table at 5:00 pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's going to be opening day weekend of  &lt;b&gt;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1&lt;/b&gt; and tickets are being sold now! Care to brave the madhouse to see it in IMAX at the 7:30 pm show? Let's get in line at 6:45 pm to wait for the doors to open. Anybody have suggestions where they want to get together for dinner at 5:00 pm? Usually we seem to just go to Rock Bottom &lt;a href="http://www.rockbottom.com/boston" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rockbottom...&lt;/a&gt;, since they are accomodating with large groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Purchase tickets&lt;/b&gt;: $16.50 for the 7:30 pm show in IMAX &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/amcloewsbostoncommon19_aapnv/theaterpage?date=11/20/2010" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fandango.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Fandango:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/harrypotterandthedeathlyhallows:part1_109947/movieoverview" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fandango.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Opens November 19, 2010 | Runtime:2 hr. 27 min&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Without the guidance and protection of their professors, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) begin a mission to destroy the Horcruxes, the sources of Voldemort's immortality. Though they must rely on one another more than ever, dark forces threaten to tear them apart. Voldemort's Death Eaters have seized control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts, and they are searching for Harry -- even as he and his friends prepare for the ultimate showdown&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be in the bar area of Rock Bottom between 4:45 pm at 5:00 pm for anyone who wants to grab dinner. We can put our name in for a table at 5:00 pm for wheoever is there by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't come to dinner? We should meet outside the theater at 6:40 pm, all of us jumping into line to be seated at 6:45 pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is two-and-a-half hours long. We probably wouldn't be leaving the theater until 10 pm the earliest. If anyone still wants to go out for drinks after, the bar area of Rock Bottom always seems like a good late night venue to stand around and socialize... unless anyone has other suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trivia, from IMDB.Com:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/trivia" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;At first, this was meant to be only one film, but due to the size of the book, and the decision that nothing could be left out to squeeze into one movie, the producers decided to split it into Part I and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;At first, both parts (I &amp;amp; II) would be converted in IMAX 3D (during post-production) but Warner Bros. canceled this conversion for Part I and (until now), only Part II would be the only Harry Potter movie that it will be released entirely in 3D. &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trailer&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/hdmovietrailers/harrypotterdeathlyhallows:trailer2-1597743022/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fandango.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
