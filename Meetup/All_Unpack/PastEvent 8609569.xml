But they sure are beautiful!  The premise is simpleâ€¦pay your $15 admission fee, then select a handmade bowl from the table, and have an unlimited lunch of soup and bread in your bowl.  Then keep the bowl!  The hardest part is picking the bowl!  The event is at Manchester Community College and we will meet there at noon.  Shopping at the craft fair after lunch is always a nice option, too!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet near the registration table, where we will linger over choosing bowls</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225036260000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219591049000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Empty Bowls</name><id>8609569</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224345600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/8609569/</event_url></item>
