It is theirs.  PLEASE read below carefully.  If for any reason you do not think that you can keep your RSVP or agree with their policy, please update your RSVP as soon as possible I will be giving the correct count of people attending in our group(s), by Tuesday 12/4.  As of right now, between my 2 meetup groups, there are 15 friends attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their policy is that if 25% of the group doesn't attend, &lt;span style="color : #3366ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will get charged&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a $25.00 flat fee for the missing people&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I am taking a chance on you past “no shows”, that you will come through and attend this event seeing that you have already signed up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is too late for me to ask you to pay a deposit that I would reimburse at the event, so I will have to ask you now if think that you will not come, or want to change your mind at the last minute, or something has/will come up, then please change your RSVP now.  I GET that things happen, but I also get that I DON’T want to get charged for something that I have no control over.  I really would hate to have to pay $25.00 out of MY pocket because YOU didn’t show up to an event that you said you would go to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need any further information please see the contact button on the left of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see ALL of you at this event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go get into the holiday spirit by joining The Griswold family's plans for a big family Christmas predictably turn into a big huge funny disaster!  The 1989 Christmas comedy film directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik.  It is the third installment in National Lampoon's Vacation film series, and was written by John Hughes, based on his short story in National Lampoon Magazine, Christmas '59'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since its release in 1989,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Christmas Vacation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;has received critical acclaim and is often considered a modern holiday classic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost for the movie:&lt;/strong&gt; FREE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food:&lt;/strong&gt; You pay for what you eat, we will try for separate checks or get 2 people on each check, so it is easy to figure out for everyone, please try to bring small bills so it is easy to figure out what you have to pay and easy on the waitstaff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reservation:&lt;/strong&gt; I will be making one for the group when we have 8ppl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be scheduled on my 2 Meetup sites, (Our Circle of Friends and Connection &amp;amp; Friends) there may be more people going to this event then you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute now and put the Meetup phone into your phone, that way if you are are running late, can’t find us or need to cancel at the last minute, you already have it in your phone:  978-304-2811, please note this phone does not accept text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time for you to pay your dues?  Please look at your profile page where it states “Membership dues last recorded by your Organizer” You can pay your dues at any event.  Thank you in advance for paying your dues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow may cancel this event please remember to check back to see if we are still going to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a courtesy to everyone in the group come back to the event page and change your RSVP if your plans change or call me/send a message through the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing you at this event!&lt;/p&gt;
