Our first meeting had 8 members, included several shorter meditations, and involved discussion around mindfulness, meditation technique, and setting intentions for the next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each week we'll be meeting at the First Parish Church at 425 Congress Street. The front door needs to stay locked, so try to make it by 6pm. It's OK to come late, just ring the bell and someone will be down to open the door for you. It's open to the public, so bring a friend or spread the word if you want. The donation is only a few dollars to cover weekly rent and expenses, and whatever you can afford is appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want, bring a favorite book or reading pertaining to mindfulness to help support discussion. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Cannon, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be greeting people as they arrive.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232409603000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231247041000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Mindfulness Meetup</name><id>9457566</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231801200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9457566/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
