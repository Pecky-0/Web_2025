I can set up at least 5 different tables with various games going on. If you don't play games or cards...come anyway...for the fun of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can try this out and make it a monthly thing if it goes well. So come out, see what it is all about and lets have a blast! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what we'll do...bring your game, a deck of cards, or whatever. Bring your beverage (ahem...lol), perhaps a snack...nothing big, maybe some chips, nuts, a dessert or whatever you like to pick on. I'll supply the house, ice, paper goods...well you all know the drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for FUN &amp;amp; GAMES NIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>White house...red brick front...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268094688000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266474554000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Deal Me In...Cards, Games, Etc.</name><id>12636040</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267921800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/12636040/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/e/6/global_13177510.jpeg</photo_url></item>
