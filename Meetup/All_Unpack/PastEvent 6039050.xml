The question it seeks to answer is whether the inhabitants of a small town were part of the revolution before the fall of Communism in Romania in 1989. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;As dawn breaks in a provincial town and the street lights expire, the owner and honey-voiced anchorman of the local TV station is planning his traditional broadcast to commemorate the December 1989 revolution by asking whether their town took part in it or not. Pressing into service a devoutly alcoholic teacher (who berates his high school students that &amp;quot;you can?t even cheat properly&amp;quot;), and the town?s cranky aged Santa Claus, the host produces a comically disastrous hour of television that becomes obsessed with the titular minute.  &amp;quot; Bright Light Film Journal &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a complete review: &lt;a href="http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=143725&amp;amp;buy=closed&amp;amp;Tab=reviews&amp;amp;CID=13#tabs" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.reel.com/m...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the Best Film at the 2006 Transylvania Film Awards(somethings you can't make up), this also won two awards at that other film festival, Cannes.  I saw this &amp;quot;good, little film&amp;quot; at the HFA earlier this year and wouldn't mind re-visting it once again in the hope of a lively discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is the custom, Tom will be holding a Meet-Up sign near the front row at the film's conclusion and then its off to a local restaurant to discuss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there, &lt;br /&gt;Tom &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186086261000</updated><rating><average>4.63000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184722424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Romanian Comedy for a Sunday Afternoon?</name><id>6039050</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185741900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6039050/</event_url></item>
