This time we're going to go Italian.  Just a stone's throw from Tufts, Salvatore's features an upscale atmosphere and spectacular food at reasonable prices.  Most lunches are around seven bucks including salads, sandwiches, giant wraps, and classic entrees like chicken parmesan, gnocchi, and linguine &amp;amp; mussels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://salvatoresrestaurants.com/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Salvatore's Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will either split the check or get separate checks for attendees.  While the restaurant is only a few minutes from campus, it's probably too far to walk so we'll need to drive and/or carpool.  I have been told that there is plenty of street parking on Governor's Ave, next to the restaurant, as well as in the municipal parking lot out back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at: rich.kelley@tufts.edu.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Tufts Faculty-Staff Meet-up sign on my table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1290176620000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288040117000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mangiare!!
