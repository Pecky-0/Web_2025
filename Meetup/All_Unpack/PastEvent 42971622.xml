American Heritage Chocolate is dedicated to preserving the colonial tradition of making chocolate, and employees will be on hand at the Old South Meeting House to demonstrate seventeenth-century chocolate making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Rich History: A Celebration of Chocolate at Our Annual Holiday Open House&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the rebellion against tea in the colonial era, our forefathers chose a more opulent and rich drink to symbolize freedom -- hot chocolate! Join the team from American Heritage Chocolate to ring in the holidays at the Old South Meeting House with a taste of handcrafted chocolates made with authentic seventeenth-century recipes. FREE and OPEN to the public.******&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the Old South Meeting House, and the folks there informed me that they were giving a ten-minute talk about colonial beverages at 2 p.m. We'll learn how chocolate, coffee, and tea were served in the colonies. This is a good time to find me: &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'll be at the 2 p.m. talk carrying a red backpack and wearing a red knit pullover.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (I'll also try to remember my&amp;nbsp;meetup sign.) I plan to be at the Old South Meeting House by 1:30 p.m. You might be able to find me in the Meeting House before 2 p.m., but it will probably be easier to look for me during the ten-minute talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talk, we can check out the chocolate-making demonstrations, which will continue after the talk until 3 p.m. I was also told that authentic seventeenth-century recipes and chocolate samples will be distributed to anyone who is willing to taste them. And that would be everyone, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
