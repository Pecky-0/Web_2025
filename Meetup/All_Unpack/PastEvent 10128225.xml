The term was originally applied (by a group of French critics) to American thriller or detective films made in the period 1944–54 and to the work of directors such as Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, and Billy Wilder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;femme fatale |&amp;#716;fem f&amp;#601;&amp;#712;tal; f&amp;#601;&amp;#712;täl|&lt;br /&gt;noun ( pl. femmes fatales pronunc. same)&lt;br /&gt;an attractive and seductive woman, esp. one who will ultimately bring disaster to a man who becomes involved with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;========================================================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this photo shoot, the concept is a private investigator who is meeting his femme fatale at a bridge with the city lights in the background.  I'll set up the hot shoe lights, but bring your own as backup.  I'll help with posing the models a little bit as well but feel free to pose them yourself.  We'll photograph them together for the concept, and then we'll split up into two groups to photograph the models separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The femme fatale model is Lily, &lt;a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/428627" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.modelmayhe...&lt;/a&gt;, who is 5 ft 9.&lt;br /&gt;The private investigator is to be announced later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll have the opportunity to photograph the models separately and together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Northern Avenue Bridge, near the Federal Courthouse and &lt;a href="http://www.barkingcrab.com/locations.html" target="_blank"&gt;Barking Crab Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shoot, we can get food at the &lt;a href="http://www.barkingcrab.com/locations.html" target="_blank"&gt;Barking Crab&lt;/a&gt;.
