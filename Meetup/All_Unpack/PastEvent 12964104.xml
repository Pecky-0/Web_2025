This is the famous location where fans regularly gather to watch Red Sox games while pulling up a chair or standing along the sidewalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harvard Square Business Association and the Cambridge Center for Adult Education have teamed up to celebrate one of America's Favorite Pastimes in one of America's oldest gathering places, next to Cardullo's Gourmet Shoppe - the home of the illustrious &amp;quot;Chair Club&amp;quot; where fans from across the world gather to share their love of Baseball. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebrate Opening Day with an Open Mic and an open invitation to step up to the plate and speak one's mind about baseball, opening day, the season ahead and those that have come before. There will be a few celebrity guests welcoming opinions, trivia, well wishers, stories, poems, facts, prayers, readings, and clean knock-knock jokes etc... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be ballpark treats - some to sample, some to purchase and a few other surprises. &lt;br /&gt;Special 1950 style prices for a Coke. Hot Dog, and Crackerjacks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of their anniversary Cardullo's will tune their world-famous Window TV to the game and will turn back the clock to the decade when they first opened. They will feature music from that period, offering special &amp;quot;remember when&amp;quot; pricing on select items and a staff dress code.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information and updates can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.harvardsquare.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.harvardsquare.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270584796000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269313218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Opening Day!
