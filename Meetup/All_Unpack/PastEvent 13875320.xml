So, we'll have our August meetup at McDonald Park in Medford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This large park has lots of open grassy areas, paved paths, and one side of it is the shore of the Mystic River (good for swimming or wading if a dog needs to cool off on a hot day). It's a lovely place to walk along the paths on a leash, or to run and chase birds and even an occasional rabbit. The parking lot is on Rte 16, near Wellington Circle, Medford. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting the meetup at 9:30 am, hoping to beat the heat!  If anyone wants to start earlier, please post a time in the comment of your RSVP.  If a majority agrees, I will modify the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Laura &amp;amp; Molly,&lt;br /&gt;Karla &amp;amp; Rufus&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We are meeting at theTorbert McDonald Park.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281572847000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277221605000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel August Meetup</name><id>13875320</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281274200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/13875320/</event_url></item>
