&lt;p&gt;***For those who have not yet purchased tickets, this event is&amp;nbsp;about 90% sold out***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have had enough of winter and are ready for another great wine tasting event from Boston Uncorked, purchase your tickets now. Last months event was cancelled due to weather conditions so this one should fill up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The event will take place from 7:00 - 9:00 PM at Morton's Steakhouse at 699 Boylston Street at Exeter Street in the Back Bay. We will be joined by Tonya's Boston Happy Hour&amp;nbsp;and Cathy Hugyes Boston Wine groups.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Uncorked invites you to join&amp;nbsp;them for Winter Warm-Up 3 as it is just the right recipe to enjoy copious wines and hors d'oeuvres, be warm and cozy with great people in this warm and cozy atmosphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a glass, grab a&amp;nbsp;plate, grab a couch and grab some gab with equally warm people. There is no better way to stay warm on this Wednesday night in Boston.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are $39.00 per person. There are no Maybe RSVPs since you must purchase a ticket in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
