It?s at Concord Center off the rotary (RT 62) then move on to see some of the interesting old graves like: Hill Buying Grounds and Main Street Burying Grounds. Take some photos around the center too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then head over to Sleepy Hollow Cemeteries afterwards for the prize! It has an estimated 10,000 gravesites, many of local, national, and international interest. It was one of the first cemeteries in the United States to be designed to have a sylvan character and has also been listed in the National Register of Historic Places. To the right of the Melvin Memorial, up a short stretch of road lies a hollow, on the far side of which is Authors Ridge. Graves of Henry Thoreau (1862), Nathaniel Hawthorne (1864), Ralph Waldo Emerson (1882), Louisa May Alcott (1888) and her father, Bronson Alcott (1888). Each is buried in a family plot and marked with modest stones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it?s a photo shoot all are welcome to tag along for the walk and see the leaves change and enjoy the sites!
