I believe they have to be ordered at least 48 hours in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care, Susan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt; Previous comments: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please write in and say if you could drive (I think every rider could contribute $5 for gas - does that sound fine?) A couple people I've met don't have cars, so those who do, please say so when you have time. Best, Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will have blue balloons again (that  float this time) near ticket booths.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan C</member_name><member_id>6899147</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219800587000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213660375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beethoven's 9th at Tanglewood on the Lawn</name><id>8155014</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219595400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/8155014/</event_url></item>
