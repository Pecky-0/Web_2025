<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Downtown Boston Maltese Meetup is hosted by DoggieDay Playcenter and is free to all its members. There will be refreshments and prizes, and you can even arrange to give your dog a bath at our state of the art grooming facility. The purpose of our group is to provide an opportunity for the members to socialize, the pups to play, and to provide an enviroment that is safe and friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is a free group and we only want you to come and enjoy yourself and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reminder, there will be photos taken with Santa on December 10th and 11th at the playcenter and the proceeds will benefit the MSPCA's Animal Care and Adoption center.  For more information, go to &lt;a href="http://www.doggieday.com/christmas" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.doggieday....&lt;/a&gt;. The Donation for the photos is $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2408295</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540025000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Maltese Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-115</urlname><id>215542</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Downtown Boston Maltese Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1134932475000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Downtown Boston Maltese Meetup January Meetup</name><id>4818231</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1137866400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-115/events/4818231/</event_url></item>
