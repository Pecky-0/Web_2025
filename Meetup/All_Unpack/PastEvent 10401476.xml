If you're coming please RSVP by 1pm on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touch of Evil by Orson Welles (1958, 95 min.). Rape, interracial marriage, and drug use, all forbidden by the Production Code, are seen in Welles's classic film. From the infamous opening shot, Touch of Evil is a tale of corruption and greed along the United States and Mexican border. Detective Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his new wife, Susan (Janet Leigh) become mixed up in drug smuggling case on the way to their honeymoon. Orson Welles plays ruthless police captain Hank Quinlan, who opposes Vargas's involvement in the case and uses his power push him away. Quinlan, one of film noir's most complex characters, uses a tough exterior to cover up his past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brown Sugar Cafe has closed, but another Thai restaurant has taken its place.

It's on Jersey and Park, across the Fens from the MFA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://thaitation.com/dmenu.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://thaitation.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in front of the screen, right side, after the movie</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>4007722</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244488899000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242219905000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Touch of Evil  (Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh)</name><id>10401476</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244315700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/10401476/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/1/9/global_8611561.jpeg</photo_url></item>
