&lt;p&gt;This is a somewhat unusual and very late request. I am writing to request volunteers to come help us prepare and serve a meal for Boston's less fortunate on tomorrow.  Due to the situation in Boston, a lot of our normal volunteers are not able to attend. We are very shorthanded tomorrow.   I am sending out this request to see if we can get folks to come help tomorrow from 12:30pm to 4:30pm.  We need about 6-10 people to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caveat to all this is that if the city is still in lockdown, we will not serve out because the safety of our guests and volunteers is of prime importance.  I'm hoping to get a group of folks from Boston  Volunteers who read this tonight and want to come help, but who understand if we cancel given the volatile nature of what our city is experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will send out a message by 10am tomorrow with a decision. We just want to have people available if it is a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday/Sunday's Bread (SSB) serves meals every Saturday and Sunday, at St. John's the Evangelist Church (35 Bowdoin Street, Beacon Hill, Boston). We ask volunteers to come at 12:30pm and stay until 4:30pm (12:30pm - 2:30pm Dining hall setup/Meal Preparation, 2:30pm - 3:30pm Volunteers serve the meals to guests, 3:30pm - 4:30pm Clean - up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. John's is conveniently located in downtown Boston near the State House and is easily accessible via the T. There are also several parking lots nearby. There is metered parking on the streets in front of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come to volunteer, please use the handicapped accessible ramp entrance on the right hand side of the church, and press all the doorbells so we hear you in the dining hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NOTE for those using GPS: We are on Beacon Hill, not in Dorchester - the zip code for St. John's the Evangelist is 02114 - please make sure you use this so you don't end up in the wrong location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For logistical information, please visit our website at SatSunBread.org. In existence for over twenty (20) years, SB has no paid staff and no office. We serve Boston's less fortunate with compassion, efficiency of resources, and fun. Please join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please sign up if you are 100% sure you can make it. If you aren't 100%, but want to be on our email list, please shoot me an email. We are here every weekend, so if you cannot help this particular weekend, there will be plenty of need on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can come down, please RSVP. Thank you very much for your generosity of spirit, and we hope to see many of you on the 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very truly yours,&lt;/p&gt;
