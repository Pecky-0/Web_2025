&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure exactly what's playing at the Kendall, but we'll pick something good (at the very least it will be Page One of the New York Times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There won't be time to grab a bite, but there is food for sale along the river and we can walk and talk and watch the display.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be on the right side of the theater after the show.  Before and during the show, I'll be in about the center of the 5th row.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309876148000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308504295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movies/Fireworks:  Movie is The Trip - it starts at 6:45</name><id>22744751</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309819500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/22744751/</event_url></item>
