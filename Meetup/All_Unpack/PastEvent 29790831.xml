&lt;p&gt;If you are on 101 heading east towards Candia get off at exit 2 and take a right at the end of the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &amp;nbsp;you are on 101 heading west towards Manchester get of at exit 2 and take a left at the end of the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pass Holidays Bar and Grill which will be on your left. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn left onto Old Candia Road which &amp;nbsp;just a little ways past Holidays. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceed 1.5 miles on Old Candia Road (at &amp;nbsp;0.4 miles you will be passing the usual entrance we take to get onto Tower Hill Road).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn left onto Chester Turnpike and proceed 2.0 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn left onto Tower Hill Road. &amp;nbsp;There is a tree trunk missing it's top that is about 15 feet tall at the intersection. &amp;nbsp; The tree is on the right.

&lt;p&gt;Proceed 1.5 miles on Tower Hill Road which is a dirt road. &amp;nbsp;At &amp;nbsp;1.5 miles you will come to 2 signs saying the road is closed and the gate is right there very near the signs. &amp;nbsp;You can actually drive another 0.3 miles on the road before you come to the jersey barrier blocking the highway underpass. At the Auburn end of Tower Hill Road.&lt;/p&gt;
