I've had him since May 2007.  He's a great character, as I'm sure all Pugs are.  I grew up in Eastern Mass. and moved out here in 1992.  I really like WMass, and wouldn't be able to move "back east"  - too crowded.</bio><topics /><name>Gail</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>8719047</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>South Hadley</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/8719047</link><visited>1357260779000</visited><lon>-72.58</lon></member>
