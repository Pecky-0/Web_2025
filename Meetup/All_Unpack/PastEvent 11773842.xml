We call it a festival because in addition to dedicated tournaments and freeplay areas we've got nerdcore concerts, panel discussions, and an exhibitor hall filled with booths displaying the latest from top game publishers and developers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, aside from San Diego Comic Con, PAX is the pinnacle gamer event, and now it is coming to Boston (only location on the East Coast) so you have no excuse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This event is SOLD OUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the scope of this event, we're going to try to meetup for meals, because hey, everyone's got to eat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the mini-meetup schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday Lunch Meetup: 12:00 PM (noon) at the California Pizza Kitchen in the Prudential Center (it is attached to the Hynes Convention Center). The Doors open for PAX at 2 PM, so this should give us plenty of time to meet up, eat, then head over. Details on the California Pizza Kitchen are &lt;a href="http://www.prudentialcenter.com/dine/dine_detail.php?id=58" target="_blank"&gt;here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday Dinner Meetup: 7:00 PM at the Cheesecake Factory in the Prudential Center.
