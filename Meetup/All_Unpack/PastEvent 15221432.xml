Ghost Hunters filmed an investigation of it a few years ago. For those of you who aren't familiar with the mansion, here's a bit of information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mansion (circa 1875) was built by Gardner chair manufacturer, S.K. Pierce . It has been &amp;quot;certified&amp;quot; haunted by six mediums and paranormal researchers. To date, the spirits identified are a nineteen year old female servant from the late 19th century, a man who perished in a fire at the house in 1963, and a little boy who often visited the mansion but did not live there. Paranormal activity includes footsteps and shadow people throughout the house's 26 rooms. Most of the spirit activity takes place on the third floor--the former servants' quarters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup will be an all-night investigation of the mansion. Of course, you can leave whenever you want, but they're letting us investigate all night if we feel up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: Saturday, January 8, 2011, starting at 8pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where: Mansion is located in South Gardner, at the corner of Rte 2A and Union Street. It's a three-story yellow Victorian with a tower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: There is a $50 charge per person, which is reasonable I think, given the length of time we can investigate.  &lt;b&gt;You must pay me in advance, so that I can pay the owners in advance to hold the date.&lt;/b&gt;  If you sign up, I'll need a check from you no later than December 1. You can send it to me at:&lt;br /&gt;7 Old Princeton Road Cutoff&lt;br /&gt;Hubbardston, Ma 01452&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to bring: Comfortable clothes, a flashlight, any equipment you have. We'll have snacks and sodas for folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm placing a 10-person limit on this meetup because it's a relatively small location. The owner has placed a 5-person minimum for an investigation, so I'll need at least 5 people to commit to going.&lt;br /&gt;If we have more people interested than the 10-person limit, just sign up on the waiting list and I'll run another meetup there in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy </member_name><member_id>7992934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1294678163000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>footsteps-paranormal-meetup</urlname><id>1305459</id><group_lat>42.5699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0</group_lon><name>Footsteps Paranormal Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288023053000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Overnight Investigation at Haunted Victorian Mansion in Gardner</name><id>15221432</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294534800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/footsteps-paranormal-meetup/events/15221432/</event_url></item>
