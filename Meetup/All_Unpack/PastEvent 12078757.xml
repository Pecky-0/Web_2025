This classic &amp;quot;hole in the wall&amp;quot; restaurant made a big impression on lots of people.  Apparently there is something about the &amp;quot;Crazy Roll&amp;quot; that drives one to distraction...and has kept this place in Dawn's thoughts since August.   In any case, everyone agreed to make our next meeting there without any hesitation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearing this request for a repeat restaurant got me thinking that perhaps we should do a year end poll to pick the &amp;quot;Best of 2009 Middle of CT Sushi Meetup Group Restaurant.&amp;quot;  I am putting together a poll, and will send another email linking you to that.  If you can complete the poll prior to this event, I will announce the results at Tokyo II on Jan. 3rd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it actually BE Tokyo Sushi II?  Or another restaurant that you forgot about?  Come find out!  And ring in the new year with yummy food and fun friends! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;Kelly&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelly S</member_name><member_id>2538500</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262732606000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ct</urlname><id>900540</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven County Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260754534000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy 2010 and Best of 2009 Sushi !</name><id>12078757</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262559600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ct/events/12078757/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/c/global_7885132.jpeg</photo_url></item>
