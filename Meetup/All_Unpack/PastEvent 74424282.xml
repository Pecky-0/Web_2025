&lt;p&gt;The Swedish thriller &lt;em&gt;Easy Money&lt;/em&gt; layers three stories of illicit drugs and organized crime, all leading to an explosive finale. Joel Kinnaman (Stephen Holder on "The Killing") stars as JW, a poor student who lives a double life within the wealthy Stockholm elite. He falls in love with an upper class girl and is soon lured into a world of crime. Jorge (Matias Padin Varela) is a fugitive on the run from the police and the Yugoslavian mafia. His plan: import a massive cargo of coke and then disappear for good. Yugoslavian hitman Mrado (Dragomir Mrsic) is trying hard to find Jorge but his criminal life takes a turn when he is forced to take care of his young daughter. While JW starts a journey into the dark world of organized crime, the fates of all three men come together in a struggle of life and death. Based on the international best-selling book &lt;em&gt;Snabba Cash&lt;/em&gt; by Jens Lapidus, the first installment in his Stockholm Noir Trilogy. Directed by Daniel Espinosa &lt;em&gt;(Safe House)&lt;/em&gt;. (Fully subtitled)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From Dana Stevens at Slate:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Easy Money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the hit 2010 Swedish thriller that is only now getting its U.S. release, pretty much had me at “Joel Kinnaman.” And he doesn’t disappoint: As a social-climbing business student mixed up in a mob scheme, Kinnaman is transfixing. But this tense, gritty, often heartbreaking underworld drama is much more than just a showcase for the actor’s talents. Based on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Money-Novel-Jens-Lapidus/dp/0307377482" target="_blank"&gt;a bestselling novel by criminal lawyer Jens Lapidus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—unfortunately, the American distributors chose not to stick with the catchy original title,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snabba Cash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy Money&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;weaves three interrelated storylines into a broad, thematically ambitious portrait of Stockholm’s ethnically divided criminal culture...&lt;/span&gt;Genre films this smart and character-driven don’t come along often on either side of the Atlantic. So go see Joel Kinnaman and &lt;em&gt;Easy Money&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://screenrant.com/zac-efron-snabba-cash-remake-easy-money-ross-54402/" target="_blank"&gt;the Zac Efron-starring American remake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;comes out. You’ll be glad you went with the import."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should be fun for a Saturday in Summer, with good discussion after the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at the movie,&lt;/p&gt;
