While the restaurants have outdoor seating, as a larger group we will be seated inside.  However, we will still have a view of the Marina and the Boston Skyline.  Marina Bay restaurants are not cheap but we will not be going to the most expensive restaurant either.  Appetizers start around $4 and entrees range from $8-$15 and up.  The food is delicious and the atmosphere can't be beat on a nice summer night.  Please join us for Dinner @ Marina Bay!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, August 9th @ 6:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Skyline Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;Marina Bay&lt;br /&gt;North Quincy, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $2pp &lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: Max of 16 people.&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: 4pm on Wednesday, August 8th (Please Note: We need to confirm with the restaurant 24 hours in advance.
