This seminar emphasizes the importance of learning to listen, without distraction, to that &amp;quot;still small voice&amp;quot; within, so often revealed through the lives of the mystics of all the world's religions. In this seminar, learn to quiet your mind and tap into a natural state of rest, peace, joy, and creativity that is possible for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher. Currently, he serves as Co-Director of the Order of Christ/Sophia, teaching and ministering to his spiritual students, and guiding fifteen Centers of Light and their ministers around the country. He travels between these Centers year-round, teaching and lecturing, as well as performing his music as a singer-songwriter of Mystical Christian folk rock. Many of the elements of the Mystical Christian teachings can be heard and experienced in Father Peter's music, encouraging the listener to seek and discover the Truth within. Listen to his music on Sophia Radio. When not traveling, Father Peter lives at the Center of Light in Chicago, IL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273500974000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271963115000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  Stilling the Mind to Attain Inner Peace</name><id>13260970</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273327200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/13260970/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/4/global_4477444.jpeg</photo_url></item>
