<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So I am itching for some beach volleyball. I think the weather will be good enough for beach volleyball around upper 60s.  This meetup is strictly for intermediate level players or higher.  If you are a beginner and have never played on sand this might not be for you but you can come and work on your tan:-)  We will be playing 2s, 3s or 4s but no more....depending on how many will show up.  Will start at 1pm.  When you get to Carson Beach you should see the Volleyball poles from the very beginning of the beach.  I will try to set it up in that area.  Bring your beach equipment :-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>T-Stop Red Line - JFK/UMass Station</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Huy</member_name><member_id>4635993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1336954598000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336535131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beach Volleyball at Carson Beach - Please Read Before RSVP</name><id>64033732</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336842000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/64033732/</event_url></item>
