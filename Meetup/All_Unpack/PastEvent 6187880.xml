Let's shake off the Summer Lethargy and get back to work on Reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's lots to talk about and plenty to yack about: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason 4.0 will be out in 21 days, several of our members are working on great music and willing to share it, and we're looking for ways to make it easier for all of us to collaborate or at least get ourselves heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have at least one agenda item this month, in that I'll be giving a little review of several ways to get your music heard online and the pros/cons of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always you can review &lt;a href="http://electronicmusic.meetup.com/137/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=2644004"&gt;&amp;quot;What we're about&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and I'd like to mention that we've had a lot of new faces at the last couple meetings, so if you're tired of my mug, you can gaze at the new folks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to RSVP early so we know how many are coming and we'll see you in a couple weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-L&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luke Stark</member_name><member_id>3565678</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541960000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Music Makers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>musical</urlname><id>413373</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Music Makers With Relaxed Expectations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187222637000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Reason Users Group September Meetup</name><id>6187880</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190242800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/musical/events/6187880/</event_url></item>
