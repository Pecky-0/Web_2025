Our permaculture friend&lt;b&gt; Noah Wentworth of Evergreen Building Collaborative&lt;/b&gt; will be taking us on a slideshow/tour of all the different options and, based on what we learn, we can organize some hands-on sessions for Spring or see who wants to help each other on personal projects....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This meetup is based on the idea submitted by Max J so we hope to cover things like strawbale, cob, cordwood, tipis, yurts, yomes, domes, etc. as well as start a discussion of how we work together on some of these.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details to be posted soon.
