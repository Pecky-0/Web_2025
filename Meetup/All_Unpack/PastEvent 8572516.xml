Callers will have the opportunity to participate in a hosted discussion with Richard Kuhnel, who played a key role in Sandpoint, ID becoming the second official US Transition Town.  Find out how the Transition process works, and how it can lead to your community to planning for energy descent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skypecast can be found at: &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/5e43sw" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/5e...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To participate in the group discussion, you will need to have installed a free copy of Skype (www.skype.com) onto your computer, and have a microphone/headset to use with it.  Just click on the link above at 7:30PM on 8/21, and you will be able to navigate to the event.  There is no charge for this service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five callers will be able to converse with Richard at any time.  Other callers can listen in, or can chat with the moderator behind the scenes to move into a queue for these slots.  This is a great opportunity to learn, and ask questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be moderating the skypecast</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alastair</member_name><member_id>4963124</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219534297000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>TT'rs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>TI-Portland</urlname><id>1233823</id><group_lat>43.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2900009155</group_lon><name>Tohidu Transition - Portland Maine</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219103403000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Transition Town Sandpoint, Idaho  (7:30 PM EDT)</name><id>8572516</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219361400000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/TI-Portland/events/8572516/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/a/global_4989194.jpeg</photo_url></item>
