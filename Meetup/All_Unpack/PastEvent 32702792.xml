&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Inn at Castle Hill!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/b/2/8/event_54107912.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Let's enjoy the last of the summer weather enjoying ocean breezes and sailboat watching on the lawn of this exquisite and beautiful inn! Highly rated, and much touted, the food here is fabulous and equally expensive (unless you go during Newport Restaurant Week), as are the accommodations, BUT they serve drinks on the lawn through October so even the regular folk can enjoy an afternoon by the sea. Lots of adirondack chairs cover the expansive hillside overlooking the mouth of Newport Harbor, chair-side service and a great view of the parade of yachts sailing by make for a fantasy afternoon on the order of the Great Gatsby. They also have extensive grounds to explore that offer some of the best views of the lower part of Narragansett Bay and Block Island Sound. It is also home to the famous Castle Hill Lighthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;So, bring yourself, your friends, your kids if you have them, a jacket if its a little breezy, appropriate shoes to walk in the grass (flip flops encouraged) and let's hang out a few hours on the chairs overlooking the water and contemplating our next yacht. White gloves and hats optional (don't panic, I'm just kidding). This is truly a great spot, off the beaten path of the rest of Newport and tucked away on Ocean Drive, if you haven't been here's your chance and if you have, then do you really need an excuse? Its still summer in September, you know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Please note that during September weekends they may be offering free valet service if its crowded or if there is a wedding on the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be planted in a white adirondack chair on the expansive lawn overlooking the water wearing a scarf</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
