&lt;p&gt;Again- my disclaimer is that everyone is responsible for themselves- and that I don't know the trail network here very well, but am confident that if I were to get lost, it would be temporary (lots of main roads on all sides).&amp;nbsp; But you do need to be comfortable exploring with me if you're coming along.&amp;nbsp; Or if you know the park, please be comfortable suggesting routes as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be cancelled due to lack of interest or inclement weather.&amp;nbsp; Please note there is a $1 fee collected to help Angela defray the Meetup fees she is charged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the main lot as you come through the gate of Asbury, bear right twice</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308749182000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308609487000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last minute Summer Solstice Walk!
