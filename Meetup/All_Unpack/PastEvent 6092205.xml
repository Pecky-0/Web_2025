I will have all the materials and bottled water in the truck, so come on over for a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head north on Elm St., take a right on Webster and a left onto Hooksett Rd. just after Kinne Electric... the Puritan is on your right, Livingston Park on the left, and there is a grassy area there were we probably can stand..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If it rains we likely won't be doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185915745000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185678828000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sundae Sign Wave Manchester</name><id>6092205</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185742800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6092205/</event_url></item>
