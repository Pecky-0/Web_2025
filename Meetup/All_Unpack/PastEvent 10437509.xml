<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>***&lt;b&gt;Total miles for this ride will be between 200 - 230&lt;/b&gt; round trip from Wrentham Outlets. Not including any distance you need to travel to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a level 2 - 2 1/2. It will be a long day with backroads and possible highway. I don't belive they charge an entrance fee so cost will be for gas and lunch. If Saturday looks like rain, this ride will be canceled. Please check your email for any last minute updates. If the weather does not look good, I will cancel by Friday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As will all things, plans change unexpectedly. If your plans change and you will not attend, please update your RSVP by Friday at 6:00pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Place: Wrentham Outlets at the Dunkin Donuts&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 8:30, Leave at 9:00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have lunch at Gillette Castle, then head back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out: &lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325204" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dunkin Donuts</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254055340000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242663139000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gillette Castle, CT </name><id>10437509</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253363400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/10437509/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/c/global_10378588.jpeg</photo_url></item>
