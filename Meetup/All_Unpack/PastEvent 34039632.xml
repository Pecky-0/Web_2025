This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is:&amp;nbsp;Captain Seaweed's - on the East Side of Providence on Ives St. 3 blocks north of Wickenden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may recall, we were just here last month for one of the largest Monday Night Meetups on record. &amp;nbsp;And since it's not the usual Collective style to do a repeat so soon, you may be wondering why we're headed back. &amp;nbsp;The answer: &amp;nbsp;FREE FOOD! &amp;nbsp;The management at Captain Seaweed's was so happy about the turnout last time, and had such a great time hanging out with us, that they'd like to throw a cookout party in our honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinks will still be their usual low prices, but the burgers, hot dogs, and sides will be on the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Please be sure to RSVP by 9am on the 26th** &amp;nbsp;We need to give an accurate head count to the bar's management so they know how many people they are feeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, they don't take plastic, so bring a fist full of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's free food for everyone, so&amp;nbsp;let's check it out!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
