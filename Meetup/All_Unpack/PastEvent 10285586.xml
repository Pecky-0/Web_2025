Much of the session will likely focus on surfing skills, but it is not limited to that.  The Seabrook Harbor &amp;quot;bowl&amp;quot; offers a very safe place to learn basic kayak surf technique and boat handling skills in the surf zone.  The &amp;quot;bowl&amp;quot; is shallow water and self rescue is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some weeks, the group may opt to head out of the harbor into the open ocean for surfing on Seabrook or Hampton Beach.  We will also practice open water self and assisted rescues, towing and other basic kayak skills from time to time, depending on the desires of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High Tide Aug 11 is 3:27 p.m.  This is well past prime time for the &amp;quot;bowl&amp;quot;, so we'll definitely be heading out onto the open ocean beaches for surf or skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you come late, just paddle around the corner from the put-in, paddle out under the Seabrook Harbor bridge and you should be able to find us in the bowl or just around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put-in is at Seabrook Harbor, on the Seabrook side of the bridge on Rte 1A in the large parking lot with a restroom.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll see the kayaks and cars</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Harter</member_name><member_id>7618241</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy Foley</member_name><member_id>7753713</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250199423000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NE Seacoast Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastPaddlers</urlname><id>1238731</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240935476000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seabrook Harbor Ocean Skills/Surf Session</name><id>10285586</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250026200000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastPaddlers/events/10285586/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/0/global_8395088.jpeg</photo_url></item>
