In a &lt;b&gt;small group&lt;/b&gt; setting (no more than 10-12 people) and at an &lt;b&gt;affordable price&lt;/b&gt;, work with local permaculture designer and organizer Lisa Fernandes on a real design project close to Portland.  We will meet for 3-hour sessions and you can enroll in one or more modules.  It is expected that the whole series will be about 3-4 modules long (depending on the property) stretching between April and July.  Design and some implementation strategies will be covered.  &lt;i&gt;The series will repeat with a different project if there is enough interest. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series is suited to those who are new to permaculture or are ready to apply some of their permaculture knowledge to a &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; project. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Module #1:  The Lay of the Land&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting on-site with our &amp;quot;client&amp;quot; in South Portland to walk their 1/2 acre property near Willard Square and review their wants, needs and goals.  We will gather data and discuss the completed client questionnaire while assembling a list of site assets and site challenges that need to be addressed in any design recommendations.  We will begin brainstorming design ideas.  There will be a couple of hours of reading (mostly online) assigned before the first module.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Module #2:  No-Dig Garden Beds and Plant Selection Strategies [Date TBD soon]&lt;br /&gt;Module #3:  Water in the Landscape and Zone 0 (The Home) [Date TBD soon]&lt;br /&gt;Module #4:  [Being Developed Based on Specific Site - Date TBD soon]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet from 5:30 to 8:30 with a short 15 min break part-way through.  We can either bring potluck food to share or chip in on something to share.  Beverages provided.  Bring your potluck kit either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Payment Note:  I have turned on the Amazon payments tool that the meetup site offers because it is the only way to require payment as a condition of making a 'yes' RSVP.  This isn't my preferred method BUT in order to keep admin costs down and avoid having to manage checks/deposits/chasing non-payments &amp;amp; no-shows....well, you know.  If you are REALLY serious about attending this but cannot use plastic, please email me and we can make arrangements.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239750209000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238092495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Permaculture Design Seminar Module #1: The Lay of the Land</name><id>10042668</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239312600000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/10042668/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/e/f/global_7822847.jpeg</photo_url></item>
