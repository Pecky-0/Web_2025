Two children long to be with their parents in post-Taliban Afghanistan. Only catch is that both parents are inprisoned and so the kids decide to go on a crime spree!  After botching  a few times, they are told to watch US movies to learn how to steal and to watch European movies to learn how to be caught! Along the way they befriend a dog who looks a bit like Benji.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/08/15/stray_dogs_2006_review.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, I'll be holding a Meet-Up sign near the front row.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540676000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162146477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stray Dogs:  Children Steal to Join Inprisoned Parents</name><id>5230678</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163276100000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5230678/</event_url></item>
