&lt;p&gt;This event was originally organized by Mountaineering, Backpacking, and Climbing of New England. If you plan to attend please RSVP to the main event here so we can make sure to get payment over to EMS before the deadline on Friday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMS will provide all of the technical equipment but you are responsible for your own clothing, food, and transportation. Make sure to read through the course description and gear list on the EMS website carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For groups like ours EMS uses a 1:4 guide:client ratio with a minimum of 2 guides and we get a discounted rate that works out to $90.42 per person.&amp;nbsp;I've set this Meetup with a cap of 8 people and a waitlist. If the waitlist hits 4 people I will add more capacity. If we don't get 8 people I will cancel the Meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've set the main Meetup to require payment upon RSVP (sorry, I don't want to be left on the hook for no-shows). EMS's cancellation policy is that they will issue a 100% refund up to 7 days before the trip so that's my policy as well. If we don't have enough people to fill up 8 spots I will cancel the trip before the deadline and everyone will be refunded in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread the word to your friends who might be interested. I'm more worried about not having enough people than having too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions please ask!&lt;/p&gt;
