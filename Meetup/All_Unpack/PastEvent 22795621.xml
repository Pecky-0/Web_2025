I rarely miss it. Purchase your $45.00 ticket now to reserve your evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is Summer Solstice: the date in late June marking the first official day of summer and the years longest day of sun light. And there is Summer Solstice: the much anticipated annual Boston Uncorked roof deck wine soiree. Each celebrate the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Boston Uncorked for a sun and fun filled evening of fine wine, food and music at the Summer Solstice 7th Annual Roof Deck Wine Tasting at The Sports Club LA Roof Deck on Tuesday, June 28 from 6:45pm to 9pm. Sample over 25 fine wines from producers all&amp;nbsp;across the globe, paired with delectable bites while enjoying live jazz performed by Florencia Gonzales atop one of the city's hottest roof deck venues.&lt;/p&gt;
