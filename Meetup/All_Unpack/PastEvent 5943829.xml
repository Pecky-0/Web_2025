They paid for all those special effects, and they're going to make sure they use all of 'em, dammit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a special advance screening, I recommend buying tickets ahead of time if you're sure you want to go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.movietickets.com/pre_purchase.asp?house_id=9930&amp;amp;movie_id=49413&amp;amp;showdate=5" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.movietickets.com/pre_purchase.asp?house_id=9930&amp;amp;movie_id=49413&amp;amp;showdate=5" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.movieticke...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(if link doesn't work, go to movietickets.com or showcasecinemas.com and click through to the July 2 listings for Milford, CT Post 14 Cinema De Lux; we'll be at the 8pm show)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be in the lobby to pick up my tickets by 7:30; I'll email the contact phone number (Michelle) to everyone who RSVPs YES or MAYBE by the morning or afternoon of the event&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183593729000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182971946000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>More Than Meets The Eye....in CGI</name><id>5943829</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183420800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5943829/</event_url></item>
