Rodrigo Tarraza will present the sounds of profound shifts in awareness from the middle ages to the 21 century.  Come explore the spiritual depths of the music art form, and transcend your inner ear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rodrigo Tarraza&lt;/b&gt; is a Chilean-born, classically trained professional flutist. He toured, performed, and recorded with many international orchestras before moving to sax and electronic wind and playing bossa nova, improvisational jazz, and avant-garde music.  In 1995, he founded Ensemble Les Inegales, which released several recordings in Europe. Rodrigo has taught at the San Francisco Conservatory, the New England Conservatory, and several universities in South America.  In addition to his work with the jazz fusion band Unfulfilled Desires, he performs baroque flute with the Berkshire Baroque Trio and other groups, and teaches a course on music and the evolution of consciousness.  Rodrigo is also a core student of Evolutionary Enlightenment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ted</member_name><member_id>1467536</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286855427000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285374722000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spirit in Music Through the Ages</name><id>14887636</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286493300000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/14887636/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/f/global_7098607.jpeg</photo_url></item>
