Meet at the boat ramp at 1:00 PM, will launch by 1:15.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quiet place to paddle, a few motorboats but suitable for beginners.  We'll be on the water either 1 or 2 hours depending on the capabilities of the group (1 hour if we only cover the south half of the lake, 2 hours if we cover the whole lake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take 395 to exit 4B (Sutton Ave - Oxford Ctr).  At the end of the offramp you have to go right.  Stay straight on this road.  The entrance to the boat ramp parking area is 2.9 miles from the end of the offramp and will be on the left.  Just before the boat ramp entrance there is a horse farm on the right, and a sign that says &amp;quot;Launching Ramp&amp;quot;.  The entrance to the ramp is directly across from the entrance to the &amp;quot;Buffamville Park&amp;quot; picnic area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll either be near the entrance to the parking area, or down at the launch area (go to the back of the parking lot and turn right to go down to the launch area).</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212512984000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209433707000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak/Canoe Buffamville Reservoir</name><id>7832262</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212339600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/7832262/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
