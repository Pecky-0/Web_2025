<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Saturday, December 6,&lt;br /&gt;Come join us for a day in Rockport, MA. Santa arrives in downtown Rockport on a lobster boat at 3:45 pm, followed by the town Tree Lighting. Cape Ann Jazz Band will provide strolling holiday tunes throughout the downtown area. &lt;br /&gt;We will plan on arriving around 11-11:30 am.  Maybe have lunch somewhere, walk around Rockport and enjoy the festivities.  &lt;br /&gt;We'll leave about mid-morning... those who are coming from north of North Andover, can meet at my place around 10a.m. (Directions to come later) and we can meet up with those who are south of us at the Peabody Mall.  We can carpool from both places (maybe share the cost of fuel with those willing to drive)&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like fun doesn't it?  Of course, we always have a great time!  Come join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229453311000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227462687000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christmas in Rockport, MA</name><id>9217361</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228575600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/9217361/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/c/global_4915132.jpeg</photo_url></item>
