We'll go to an area restaurant after the film for a discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Grave Decisions:&lt;br /&gt;Eleven-year-old Sebastian, a bright, cheeky little scamp, sees life as one big adventure, yet believes he is responsible for his mother?s death because she died while giving birth to him. Apart from this ?homicide? ? a transgression for which his older brother Franz refuses to forgive him ? he has an array of other terrible misdeeds to answer for and has consequently become accustomed to battling the scourges of purgatory on a nightly basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dir. Marcus H. Rosenmüller, 1h42m, 35mm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Following the film I'll be near the exit holding a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210696665000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207574999000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grave Decisions (Wer Früher Stirbt ist Länger Tot)</name><id>7690545</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210523400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/7690545/</event_url></item>
