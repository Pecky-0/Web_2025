  &lt;br /&gt;

 A riveting story of transformation and healing, PEACEABLE KINGDOM: THE JOURNEY HOME explores the awakening conscience of several people who grew up in traditional farming culture and who have now come to question the basic assumptions of their way of life. Presented through a woven tapestry of memories, music, and breathtaking accounts of life-altering moments, the film provides insight into the farmers' sometimes amazing connections with the animals under their care, while also making clear the complex web of social, psychological and economic forces that have led them to their present dilemma.  As the final showing in the Healthy Body Healthy Lives Nutrition video series we will be showing the movie "The Peaceable Kingdom" at 7:00 PM in Fellowship Hall.  Thank you Rick and Sharon for providing the video. &lt;br /&gt;
