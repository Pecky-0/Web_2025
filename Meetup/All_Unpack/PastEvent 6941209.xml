Their show in November was so much fun. The place was full of good energy and everyone was dancing. You have to come out for this one!! Be sure to come early so we can have a chance to get together before the show starts at 9:45pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oi Gente!! (hey people!!) &lt;a href="http://www.firstnight.org/" target="_blank"&gt;First Night in Boston&lt;/a&gt; and the Grand Procession!! On New Year's Eve the temperature hovered just above freezing making for a very mild night (for Boston) to be out celebrating with hundreds of thousands of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I joined my fellow sambistas from &lt;a href="http://deraldoferreira.calabashmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Samba Tremeterra&lt;/a&gt; for the parade. (I mean when do you get to dance and play samba all the way through downtown Boston in front of crowds and crowds of people?) It was so much fun!! Later, we gathered at a house party and kept on dancing until 4am...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuneyourworld.ning.com/group/bostonworldmuse" target="_blank"&gt;Watch a short video from the parade&lt;/a&gt;.

Please join, create a profile and share your music activity around Boston (or anywhere...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dance around!! Bang a drum!! The New Year is here!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Powell</member_name><member_id>930768</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202006929000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198107943000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Samba Tremeterra at Johnny D's</name><id>6941209</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201833900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/6941209/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/e/global_2902910.jpeg</photo_url></item>
