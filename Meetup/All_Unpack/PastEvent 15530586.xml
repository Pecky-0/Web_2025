Look for other members of the group there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a reminder: This is a NoOrg, which means you will self-organize and discount tickets won't be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a NoOrg, which means an organizer may not be there and discount tickets may not be available. You can self-organize to see this movie. I'll update the time a few days before the meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet to see Tron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Flynn, the tech-savvy 27-year-old son of Kevin Flynn, looks into his father's disappearance and finds himself pulled into the same world of fierce programs and gladiatorial games where his father has been living for 20 years. Along with Kevin's loyal confidant, father and son embark on a life-and-death journey across a visually-stunning cyber universe that has become far more advanced and exceedingly dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View the trailer here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi4134312217/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/v...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so we are going to try something new for the meetup group!&lt;br /&gt;First we will meet together to get the discount tickets at least two hours before the show, as this is the opening weekend, and I would like to make sure we all get in.  Then we will go have a nice lunch somewhere local, and then return to see the show.  I am aiming for a 2ish meetup to buy tickets, lunch and then back for a 4ish show.  I know that this format is a bit different, and I hope you will join me for this adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Times will be updated the week of the show!  Hope to see you there for an afternoon of sci fi!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292701077000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290468313000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>No Org --Tron: Legacy</name><id>15530586</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292697000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/15530586/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/9/global_19826649.jpeg</photo_url></item>
