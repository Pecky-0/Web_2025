This event benefits the Boy's and Girl's Club of Leominster. &lt;br /&gt;

Most people don't realize that this club is funded mainly by donations from individuals and companies and through their fundraisers. They receive very little government funding so these fundraisers are critical to support the club. If you don't have plans, this would be a good way to spend a day! There are prizes and a BBQ at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GREAT FUTURES 5K Run &amp;amp; Walk is a fun, community event open to children, teens and adults. All proceeds to benefit the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club of Fitchburg and Leominster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club of Fitchburg and Leominster serves over 200 kids daily with nationally acclaimed life saving programs, such as “Passport to Manhood”, “Kids Capture the Universe”, and “Smart Girls”.&lt;/p&gt;
