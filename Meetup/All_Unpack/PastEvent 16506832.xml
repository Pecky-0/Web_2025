&lt;p&gt;Bring your own pendulum or purchase one at the class for $8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join this fun and interactive class to learn about the energy around you and how to hone in on it's sensation.&amp;nbsp; We will start with a brief and relaxing meditation as we move into learning about the energy around us and tuning into its vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to purchase a pendulum that resonates with you from the variety of natural stone and crystal pendulums available at the class. You will receive complete instruction on the care and use of your personal pendulum and a handout.&amp;nbsp; Learn the method of connecting with your pendulum, asking the most effective questions to receive specific answers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pendulums have been around since antiquity, with rising interest in all things "psychic", many use them on a daily basis to locate lost objects, connect to intuitive guidance, and many other subjects.&amp;nbsp; I have even witnessed people using them with food to determine if it is "fresh" or "organic"! &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; Register with Helene at &lt;a href="http://www.AngelsLighthouse.com"&gt;www.AngelsLighthouse.com&lt;/a&gt; or RSVP to this meetup.&lt;/p&gt;
