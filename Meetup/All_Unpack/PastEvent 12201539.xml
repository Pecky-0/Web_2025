And at a brand new time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us as our team demonstrates our lack of trivia knowledge while enjoying the fine food and drinks at this local establishment.  You don't have to be a master of trivia, and we get to huddle (as a team) before turning in any answers, so there is *NO* pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gas Lamp Grille Features: Great Food, Exotic Beers, Music, sports on their several large-screen plasma televisions, and most importantly, yours truly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trivia starts around 9:00 and goes pretty quickly.  We'll meet at 8:00 so we have time to chat and taunt the other teams with our patented triple Ts (Trivia Trash-Talking).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet near the Bar - Adam is 5'8", cell: (401) 699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263431575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262476378000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Gas Lamp Grille - EARLY Monday Trivia</name><id>12201539</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263258000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/12201539/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/b/global_11132507.jpeg</photo_url></item>
