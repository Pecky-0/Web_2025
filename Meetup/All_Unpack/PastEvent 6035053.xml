To be able to Top Rope climb you will probably need to take this class.  I think it would be fun to do it together!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Learn to Climb course is a comprehensive introduction to indoor climbing. It starts with the same material included in the Basic Safety course, but adds technique, climbing practice, and personalized feedback on each student?s climbing skills. The overall course teaches:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Equipment: how to use a harness and belay device&lt;br /&gt;    * Knots: tying in with a figure 8 follow-through, plus a fisherman?s backup&lt;br /&gt;    * Belaying: using a locking carabiner and ATC to confidently keep your climbing partner safe&lt;br /&gt;    * Commands: how to communicate with your climbing partner&lt;br /&gt;    * Bouldering: have fun staying close to the ground&lt;br /&gt;    * Technique: using balance, flexibility, and strength to move up a face &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking this course, most students can safely pass the MetroRock belay check, necessary to climb in the gym. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reservations: required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $65. Includes admission to the gym and gear on the day of the course, plus a Day Pass, good for admission to the gym and equipment rental on your next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: We will meet at 7:45 at the gym.  The class should wrap up around noon.  We can grab a bite to eat, then go back to the gym and do some climbing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; until you have made reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metro: &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Metro Rock Gym&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions?
