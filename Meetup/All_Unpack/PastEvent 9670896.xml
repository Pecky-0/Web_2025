Kepp in mind that if you are purchasing this book I believe you can get a 15% discount at Brookline Booksmith by telling them you are in a book club. I have added meetup's automated waiting list but I have not used it before so we will see how well it works. Feel free to email me with any questions. I have modified the message board so it is more like a forum now and you can feel free to post thoughts there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a sign up.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264377265000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233755679000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February Meetup: The Hour I First Believed by Wally Lamb</name><id>9670896</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235332800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/9670896/</event_url></item>
