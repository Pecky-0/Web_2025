You can eat and serve delicious, healthy, and attractive dishes &amp;quot;Fit for a king&amp;quot;, as Victoria Boutenko says! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this Meetup we can discuss the numerous health benefits that can be gained by incorporating more and more organic raw foods into your diet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria Boutenko healed her entire family of various ailments (quite serious) by doing nothing more than switching to a raw food diet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several DVD's and Books will be available for your perusal, which can be purchased on the following website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.rawfamily.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is not a practical demonstration on how to prepare these delicious meals, you can view photos and preparation instructions as you peruse these recipe books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attendees are welcome to bring up other topics for discussion also.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be sitting at the large table in the back, easy to spot with long black hair.
