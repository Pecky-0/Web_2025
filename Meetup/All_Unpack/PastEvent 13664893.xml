It is a 3-day (well, a 2.5 actually) activity which includes hot air balloon rides (including an hour-long scenic one over Mount Washington Valley), music and theatrical performances, shopping, dining, etc.  North Conway, located in the middle of the valley, is a perfect location for such an event as it features plenty of outdoor activities (hiking, kayaking, etc), good places to eat, interesting shops, and tons of other attractions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a good opportunity to meet members of Wedeln ski and outdoors club.  The club owns a house in North Conway (10-15 min from the center of balloon action) where you can stay for $20/person/night (21+ please).  The members are a riot, and you are guaranteed to have fun even if you don't stay for the whole duration.  The plans and headcounts are still evolving, so please do let us know if/when you'd like to stay at the house as we need to ensure someone is there to let you in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that a 1-hour scenic rides cost $175 and require advanced reservation.  Please call or email Howard Stanton at 603-356-2332 or howard@metcoffeehouse.com for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional festival information can be found at the websites below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mtwashingtonvalley.org/northconway/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mtwashingt...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/36d33df" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/36...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Feel free to call 848-702-4511.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7082162</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eugene</member_name><member_id>8909300</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie Morrissey</member_name><member_id>9613620</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276294381000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275438708000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Conway Balloon Festival</name><id>13664893</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276290000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/13664893/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/a/global_15452122.jpeg</photo_url></item>
