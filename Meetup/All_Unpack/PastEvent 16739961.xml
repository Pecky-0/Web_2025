&lt;p&gt;Details subject to refinement by Shivin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distance is approximately 13 miles, elevation gain is about 4000 feet. &amp;nbsp;Via the North Twin trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plan is to hike out the North Twin trail to North Twin. &amp;nbsp;Assuming conditions are favorable, we will continue and try to reach South Twin and then return the way we came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowshoes and crampons are an absolute must for this trip. Adequate clothing, including non cotton layers for head, face and hands is essential. Following trails in winter can be much more difficult, especially when there is fresh snow. As losing the trail is possible, it will be essential that we all stay together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description: This is challenging hike. We will be going above treeline, so you must come prepared for bad weather. Weather in the mountains is unpredictable. People have died from exposure hiking in the White Mountains in summer, so care and preparation are essential in winter. Snowshoes and crampons are an absolute must for this trip. Adequate clothing, including non cotton layers for head, face and hands is essential. Following trails in winter can be much more difficult, especially when there is fresh snow. As losing the trail is possible, it will be essential that we all stay together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necessary equipment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #8b0000"&gt;BE PREPARED FOR HARSH WINTER CONDITIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Headlamp (or flashlight) with spare batteries, or a second headlamp/flashlight.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Clothing: Layering will be important wool, synthetic or belnded shirt/pants - no jeans or cotton. Cotton does not insulate well when wet. Windy ridge conditions can compound this. Insulating layers will be essential. &amp;nbsp;You should be able to cover every centimeter of your skin if needed. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Outerwear: Waterproof/windproof jacket (with hood or separate waterproof/windproof head covering) and extra insulation. Layers are essential as the exertion will generate a great deal of heat. Rain or ski pants will be important.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Food and Water: High-energy snacks and at least two quarts of water.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Other Gear: Sunscreen &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Trail hardy winter footwear.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Whatever you'd need to survive an unplanned night out in the mountains.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;* Anything else your experience, judgment or research tells you that you need.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;See the winter hiking gear and preparation discussion on the message board for more informaiton and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;Please allow plenty of time and let me know ASAP if you are running late as cell phone coverage is not reliable. Having been burned by no shows a few times, I will not keep people waiting unless I am sure you are coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #b22222"&gt;Pedxing DISCLAIMER: MY ROLE AS ORGANIZER IN THIS HIKE IS SOCIAL. I AM NOT TRAINED TO BE A GUIDE, NOR HAVE I RECEIVED TRAINING OR INSTRUCTION IN HIKING SAFETY. WHILE I TRY TO HEAD OFF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.
