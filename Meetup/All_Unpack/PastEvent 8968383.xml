We'll discuss the results of last week's historic election.  What can we expect from an Obama administration and a Democratic Congress?  Will we see a truly progressive agenda?  Will America's stature in the world improve?  And will the son of a secular humanist, even if he currently identifies as a liberal Christian, somehow provide a boost to secularism and humanism in America?  All these and many other questions will be discussed.  Come to join the discussion and to hear what others think. Please note that the formal meeting will start at 7 p.m., but doors will open at 6:30 for anyone who wants to come early and socialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to bring payment for the February Darwin Day celebration if you plan to attend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park in the lot.
