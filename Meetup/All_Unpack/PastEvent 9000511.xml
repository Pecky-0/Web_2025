The movie starts at 6:45, but let's meet in the lobby by 6:30.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Getting Married &lt;br /&gt;Runtime:1 hr. 53 min. &lt;br /&gt;Rated R:  language and brief sexuality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kym (Anne Hathaway) returns to the Buchman family home for the wedding of her sister Rachel (Rosemarie Dewitt), she brings a long history of personal crisis and family conflict along with her. The wedding party’s abundant cast of friends and relations have gathered for an idyllic weekend of feasting, music and love, but Kym — with her black-humor and knack for bombshell drama — is a catalyst for long-simmering tensions in the family dynamic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/rachelgettingmarried/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/rachelgettingmarried/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sonyclassi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It's a gratifying return to idependent film roots for Oscar-winning director [Demme], a powerful screenwriting debut for Jenny Lumet, a herculean job of hand-held cinematography by Declan Quinn and a career-changing performance by Anne Hathaway...&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Kenneth Turan&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This is as messy, painful and complicated as real life, which is a major plus, even if it means having to sit through some uncomfortable scenes.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;USA Today&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Claudia Puig&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...may just lay the wedding film to rest, being such a hard act to follow.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Variety&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Ronnie Scheib&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet in the lobby by 6:30.
