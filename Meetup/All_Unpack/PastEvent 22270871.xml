&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/0/8/1/event_32209281.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;In
addition to the historic waterfront mystique of South Norwalk and
its variety of restaurants and stores, you get an event not to be
missed. For two days part of Washington Street is closed to traffic
to allow for stages to be erected, providing venues for music and
other performing arts entertainment in three locations all day
long. Lining the streets, artists set up their booths to sell their
photography, paintings, collages, furniture and ceramics. You'll
also find performing artists walking around the event. And then
there's the puppet parade you see pictured here. Some of the bars
will have bands playing during the event. There is definitely
something for everyone here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of all that, there are two museums and the Maritime
Aquarium in the midst of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also say that Sono Arts Festival was the site of my all
time best first date. I think the energy generated by the event had
a lot to do with that. It's a place where people can connect on a
lot of different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet in front of the SoNo Regent 8 movie theater at 11:00
AM. It's right near the largest parking area in South Norwalk where
most of us will likely be parking. We'll hang around for 1/2 an
hour while people arrive. If you can't be here at 11:00 that's OK.
I will distribute my cell phone number to everyone who signs up for
the event, so you'll be able to find us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in front of the SoNo Regent 8 movie theater at 11:00 AM.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Merrill</member_name><member_id>7492092</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312851556000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Arts  lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Arts-Cultural-Events</urlname><id>1343414</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Arts &amp; Creative Cultural Events</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308115188000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SONO Arts Celebration August 6 at 11 AM</name><id>22270871</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1312642800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Arts-Cultural-Events/events/22270871/</event_url></item>
