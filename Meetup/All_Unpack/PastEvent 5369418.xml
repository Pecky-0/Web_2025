The occupants are an Old Monk and his protege Child Monk. While exploring the world in and around their secluded idyll, Child Monk indulges in the capricious cruelties of boyhood. After tying stones to a fish, a frog, and a snake, Child Monk awakens to find himself fettered by a large stone Old Monk has bound to him. The old man calmly instructs the boy to release the animals, telling him that if any of the creatures die &amp;quot;you'll carry the stone in your heart for the rest of your life.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;This artistic meditative movie is a Buddhist tale about the seasons and tribulations of one's life. &lt;br /&gt;To see trailer:www.sonyclas sics.com/spring/ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty to talk about after viewing this movie.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170634131000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168045286000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!
