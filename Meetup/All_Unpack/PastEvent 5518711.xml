We've done this a couple of time before and it always proves a great chance to meet some new people in relaxed environment.  The venue is never too crowded at this time of day which means that is very easy to find the group if you are a debutant and that you can actually hear what your new friend is saying to you.  We'll meet on the 1st floor where the pool tables and bar are located.  Cheers guys, hope to see you all there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173809076000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172594593000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March meetup at Jillians</name><id>5518711</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1173636000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/5518711/</event_url></item>
