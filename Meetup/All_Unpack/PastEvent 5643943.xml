<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>(PLEASE NOTE DATE CHANGE.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  See details below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did you choose Python? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Developers and their companies are using Python to do all kinds of tasks. From utilities to ERP systems. Why are they choosing Python over Java, C++ and other proven enterprise 3 and 4gls? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this meeting we'll all get a chance to meet each other, learn why we've made this choice and what we've learned in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To kick off the meeting, I have asked George Lambert of Goldenware Travel to explain why his company has switched to Python and the benefits and challenges they are seeing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting will be held at my office in Somerville.  We currently have 7 RSVP's and 10 &amp;quot;Maybe's&amp;quot;.  Of course that may change with the date change.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter Marquez</member_name><member_id>4000314</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180134647000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175867048000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Cambridge Python May Meetup</name><id>5643943</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179961200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/5643943/</event_url></item>
