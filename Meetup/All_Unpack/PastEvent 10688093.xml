We'll have a delicious selection of hors d'oeuvres to compliment the evening as you wine, dine and dance. Our DJ's are The Meow Music Mix (formerly The Copy Kittens) playing all our favorite oldies, the best of today's dance songs and any request you may have. So dust off your dancing shoes, grab a friend and meet us at for a great evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is $25. Please reserve your spot on the dance floor by sending in a check to North of 40 Singles, 20 Tidd Street, Swampscott, MA 01907. You can pay cash at the door, but let me know if you're coming so we can give the chef a head-count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dance starts at 7:30. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've never been to Anthony's Pier 4 Restaurant, step into history. It's easy to get too and there's free parking right in front of the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be greeting you at the door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Richard P.</member_name><member_id>9495023</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250468922000</updated><rating><average>3.43000006676</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>dancers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Over-40-Singles</urlname><id>1455951</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North of 40 Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>47</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245421084000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North of 40 Singles Dance - Friday, July 31</name><id>10688093</id><headcount>135</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249083000000</time><rsvp_limit>250</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Over-40-Singles/events/10688093/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/4/9/global_9913353.jpeg</photo_url></item>
