Â There are a lot of hills and some rocky portions of the trail that will make this a pretty challenging hike for those not in the best of shape. It is worth the effort though as you will be able to see stone remains of mills and farmhouses, as well as a few of the over 100 rock cairns of unknown origin... ancient aliens perhaps??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should take us no longer than 90 minutes to complete one loop and doing a second loop is optional. Good hiking boots, water and insect repellant are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>4136693</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338815327000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1338474585000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Parker Woodland - Coventry</name><id>67100072</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1338730200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/67100072/</event_url></item>
