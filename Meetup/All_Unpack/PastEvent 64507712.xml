It is about the Earth sharing with us and us humans sharing with the Earth. It’s about taking some, and leaving some. It’s about participating in the endless cycles of birth and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, most consumers live in close proximity to a large grocery store, where hunting through the butcher’s cold case or deli and foraging in the produce section is about as close to the food source as they will ever get. But we should always remember that our survival starts with the land - and our connection to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these outings we hope to gain an understanding about where we stand in this world, of what we stand on, and of how we are connected to it. It is living a life that promotes peace with the land. That does not struggle, but enjoys. That does not destroy, but rejuvenates. It is life in all ways in accordance with the higher commands of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
