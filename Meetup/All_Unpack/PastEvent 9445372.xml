<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Sessions Woods is a beautiful wildlife management area that specializes in conservation education.  There are many trails throughout the area.  We are going to do 4.5 mile loop that will take us out by the beaver marsh and lodge and then pick up the Tunxis Trial around the pond and perimeter of Sessions Woods.  There are no hard ups but there are some really interesting rocks to climb.  There are also some beautiful glades of trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Education Center where there is plenty of parking and bathrooms!  If we are lucky maybe some deer will cross our path.  We should not be out more than 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what I strongly suggest you bring and wear:&lt;br /&gt;Water proof hiking boots (we are going to do some rugged areas)&lt;br /&gt;Warm coat&lt;br /&gt;Hat &lt;br /&gt;Gloves&lt;br /&gt;Mini spikes or Yak tracks since there is snow and ice out there this time of year.&lt;br /&gt;Long johns under your pants.&lt;br /&gt;A light snack.&lt;br /&gt;Water.&lt;br /&gt;Camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you updated on weather and trail conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there:&lt;br /&gt;Sessions Woods is at 341 Milford Street (Route 69) in Burlington.  It is 3.3 miles from Rt. 4 and 3 miles from Rt. 6 in Bristol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Burlington&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=341+Milford+Street&amp;amp;zipcode=06013" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sessions Woods&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2723&amp;amp;Q=326220" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail map link: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/wildlife/pdf_files/maps/maps_other/swtrail.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
