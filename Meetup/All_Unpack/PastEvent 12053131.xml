Both groups were in attendance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our permanent site, for meetups combining both groups, will be at Holliston Meadows.  The whole building is gorgeous and very clean.  We never even smell any dog smells!!!  The meetup site is cozy, clean, beautiful and personal, with windows and a treadmill.  There is an outside space fenced in where dogs can potty, connected to our meetup room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please tell other small dog owners you know.  All small dog breeds or mixed breed are invited as long as they get along with other small dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flower Kausel has offered to help me organize the meets.
