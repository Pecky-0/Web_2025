<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 2-day lovely fall hike on the Appalachian Trail starting at Bulls Bridge in South Kent, CT and heading southbound to Rte. 55 in West Pawling, NY for a total of about 17.8 miles. This is the next segment of the AT southbound from way back in May '06 for the group. We've been doing northbound segments for a while so it's time for a change. We'll spend the night at a shelter on the trail (there's a good chance it will be full so plan accordingly). This hike is for moderate hikers who have done 10 mile hikes before as well as lightly equiped backpacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Saturday will be mostly cloudy with a high of 54 and an overnight low of 31. Sunday will be sunny with a high of 57. Low 20% chance of rain both days. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at Noon at the Bulls Bridge parking area on Bulls Bridge Rd. (see below). The first day we'll cover 4.8 miles. We'll hike up Ten Mile Hill (named after nearby river) to 1,000 ft. altitude. Then we'll cross into NY and sleep at the Wiley Shelter. We should be getting to the by 4 pm to set up for the night, eat dinner, and enjoy the evening. The shelter hould be reserved for solo hikers so please try to bring a light tent and/or share tent space. If there is space, we can use it after nightfall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the second day, we'll continue starting 7:30 am sharp as we have limited daylight and 13 miles to cover. We'll end at the parking area for the AT on Rte. 55 near West Pawling, NY. Altitude range for the day will be to about 1,100 ft, down to 500 ft., up to 1,200 ft., and finish at 700 ft. We should end hiking by about 5:30 pm. Then we'll shuttle back to the cars at Bulls Bridge. If there is interest, we'll hit a place to eat in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that terrain, conditions, and individual party members may affect the overall timing of the hike and may necessitate backup plans if any member of the party runs into significant issues or if there are weather related issues that spring up. I have been conservitive with the estimated times and as long as all parties are reasonable fit, experienced, and equiped we should come in earlier than I estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;== ADVISED MUST-BRING GEAR/SUPPLIES ==&lt;br /&gt;* Full pack&lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots -Must be comfortable, &amp;amp; broken in &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks&lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing -Cold mornings/nights &amp;amp; cool afternoons, avoid cotton as it stays wet.
