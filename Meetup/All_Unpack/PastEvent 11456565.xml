You mention the word and they go pale, shake their head frantically and say “no”, they're not interested because of a bad experience with it. Are you ready for a real taste of Mexico?  It's TEQUILA time! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                            The Tequila 101 Dinner &lt;br /&gt;Tequila aficionado Richard Crowe will take you on a journey through the making of the national drink of Mexico, and you will learn basic fundamentals, information about the drink's history, as well as how to buy and taste it, plus some recommendations for bottles in a variety of price ranges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sample 3 flights of different varieties of tequila, and learn about the differences between each of them. After the seminar, enjoy a specialized authentic Mexican dinner(or you can substitute with American cuisine options), complete with a mouth-watering margarita made from your favorite from the 3 flights sampled.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Knight</member_name><member_id>4009572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256249911000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Men and Women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-527</urlname><id>501015</id><group_lat>42.9099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Cocktail Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253810389000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tequila 101 Dinner</name><id>11456565</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255993200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-527/events/11456565/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/9/global_4160137.jpeg</photo_url></item>
