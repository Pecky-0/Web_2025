However, for now, Tuesday morning at the Allston Diner can work. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We have a few new developments to discuss that will allow our members to get involved with new energy products and placement within the Boston area, (Thanks to Art for the kick off of that idea). Several local communities have expressed an interest in wind and solar installations for Libraries, Fire and Police Complexes and even some Town Halls. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Some funding is governmental, some is on the level of gifts and donations and a good portion of the labor will be of volunteers that want to contribute and learn. &lt;br /&gt;
