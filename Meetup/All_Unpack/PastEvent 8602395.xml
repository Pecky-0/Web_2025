<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>After the summer hiatus of not hosting in our home due to the heat, hopefully our house will nice and cool by late September.  We've certainly missed having all you game players in the house, but it would have been cruel of us to subject you to our lack of central air.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Friday will be a traditional board game night. Bring any favorites that you might like to play, otherwise we're fully stocked. We'll plan on ordering pizza at some point during the night as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who may be new, parking can be a little a tricky, but there are usually plenty of spots available on Cross St. Our house is pumpkin colored and the home to two cats who will be locked up for the evening. The door will be unlocked, so just come on in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We certainly look forward to seeing everyone and hearing how your summers have been!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222729371000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219458187000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Board Games in September</name><id>8602395</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221867000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/8602395/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/8/9/global_3094489.jpeg</photo_url></item>
