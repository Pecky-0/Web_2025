After all the hard work and cash we've all spent to help get our local liberty candidates elected, win, lose, or draw, we'll want to drink beer.

Although there will be food and drink, it never hurts to bring a little more.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226016477000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225571165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Election Day After Polls Close, After Hours Party</name><id>9073291</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1225843200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9073291/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
