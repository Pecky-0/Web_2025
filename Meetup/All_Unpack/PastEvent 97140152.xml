Time for another Mix +Mingle cross Meetup Private Party for up to 200 members! This will be to Celebrate our 5 year Anniversary and for that I wanted to do something Extremely Special for all my wonderful friends! We have moved to a much better spot called the WILD ROVER (at the edge of Faneuil Hall) at 61 Chatham St Boston, MA. Its at the corners of Commercial and Chatham ST next to Hong Kong Restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Website: &lt;a href="http://www.wildroverboston.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.wildroverboston.com/&lt;/a&gt; ----- Tel (857) 263-8715&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

WILD ROVER 2nd floor holds about 200 people. Weâ€™ll have our own DJ, dance floor, bathrooms, appetizers, bar area, etc. We have arranged an open buffet of apps and food from 7PM till 10PM of the following: Chicken and Buffalo fingers, beef teriyaki, stuffed mushrooms, pizza with toppings, cheese and cheese quesadillas, vegetable trays with veggie dip, cheese and crackers, ETC....so enjoy some great food while it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Background music will be at low levels upstairs from 7 to 9PM so members will have a quite time to chat. After 9PM the dancing + loud music starts. Please do not complain, since members come to dance to music after 9PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

They will have free KARAOKE on their main stage on the first floor for us as well if you want to kick it KARAOKE style all night long!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

******************************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

Now the best part!!!...If you come in between 7 and 8PM you will get 2 free drink tickets good for any beer, any wine, and lots of mixed drinks! (Sorry no shots or top-shelf liquor i.e., Patron, etc.). Drink tickets will expire at 8:30PM sharp!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

When you get there just head upstairs, (please do not block the stairway) there will be a private party sign up. Then meet/greet Biagio or ALEX (the person with colored wrist bands). Please clearly say your first name, what group you are with, and pay with a $10 bill in hand at the top of the stairs (no $1 bills, please). We will be giving you a colored wrist bands to mark who is already in so you can go upstairs and downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

1.I (Biagio) have hired a person (ALEX) to collect money so I can for talk to all our wonderful members and spend time with my girlfriend too! :-P &lt;br /&gt;

2. Everyone, but the invited Meetup Group Head Organizers, pays $10 cash. &lt;br /&gt;

3. After 9 p.m. you will have to pay another cover charge to the bar, so stretch your dollar and come before 9PM. If you get in before 9PM you ONLY have to pay $10 to Biagio. &lt;br /&gt;

4. If you come after 8PM you might not get in right away and you will have to wait downstairs with the waitlisters. This always happens so its another reason to come early! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking for this event: Street parking can be tough so you can try and of course it's hit or miss. Your best bet it take the T. The closet T stop is The Aquarium stop on the Blue line, Next would be State Street stop on the Orange line.&lt;/p&gt;
