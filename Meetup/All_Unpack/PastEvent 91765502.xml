<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;To get a better understanding of Gilles Deleuze focus on some of his key ideas from his larger works. This week's reading will come from his book Difference and Repetition and a book he co-authored with Felix Guatari, What is Philosophy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delueze &amp;amp; Guatari-What Is Philosophy? &lt;br /&gt;

- Part 1, Chapter 1: What is a Concept? &lt;br /&gt;

- Part 2, Chapter 5: Functives and Concepts &lt;br /&gt;

- Part 2, Chapter 6: Prospects and Concepts &lt;br /&gt;

- Part 2, Chapter 7: Percept, Affect and Concept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(of these, Chapters 1 and 7 are the most important)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleuze-Difference and Repetition &lt;br /&gt;

- Introduction: Repetition &amp;amp; Difference; &lt;br /&gt;

- Chapter 3: the Image of Thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These chapters - in particular, Chapter 3 - are an iconic and good summary of the epistemological point of departure for much of Deleuze's multi-directional oevre. He is an idiosyncratic variant of what Analytic philosophers have termed a Fallibilist, but this is only the front office of his peculiar, eclectic skyscraper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will try to make copies of these works available.
