For those of you who may attend that are not students of UNH Manchester your insight will be valuable. We are still in the beginnings of the process and will have to get through some technical stuff but for the most part we are going to discuss what events we are going to do moving forward. I look forward to seeing everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have many ideas for events and what we would like to do with the group so lets get together and share them! Please rsvp so I will know how big of a space we will need. Bring your ideas! There will be refreshments and games. Room is 350 on the third floor.
