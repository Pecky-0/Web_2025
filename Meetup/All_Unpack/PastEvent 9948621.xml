And the conversation can just naturally unfold and flow from there!  This gives us a chance to build a greater sense of community, share resources, network and support one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let us know what you'll bring to the potluck when you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 meeting fee.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will welcome them at the door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252686870000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236975808000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies August Meetup</name><id>9948621</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250263800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/9948621/</event_url></item>
