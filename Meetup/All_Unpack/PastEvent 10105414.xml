We will prioritize topics and get an idea of meeting times/days that work for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in helping to shape our agenda, this is the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting will focus on the following three points: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul type="1" class="fakeOL"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction of each attendee and 2-3 minute bio about what they do and what they want to achieve &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assembling a prioritized list of those subjects that are of most interest to you for discussion/research&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Networking with other Small Business Owners (bring your business cards and brochures!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If time permits, we will also tackle a few of the items on the list immediately by tapping our current knowledge base... so bring a notebook. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the cost of food is not included in the meetup fee (yet).  However, I will be refunding $5 of the $10 fee to those who attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-payment is required so that I have an exact headcount. Repeat Yes rsvps that do not provide payment will be removed from the meetup group - so please make sure your rsvp is accurate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pay through Pay Pal or by calling Guard Up Family Swordsmanship at (781) 270-4800 and providing your Credit Card information.  Your credit card will be charged $10 and your payment status will be changed to &amp;quot;Paid&amp;quot;.  Or, you can stop off at our facility (conveniently located near the Burlington Mall) and pay with cash or check:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guard Up! Family Swordsmanship&lt;br /&gt;141 Middlesex Turnpike&lt;br /&gt;Burlington, MA 01803&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sounds serious, it's because it is.  None of us have time to waste on a meetup that doesn't create results.  So look at your schedule and find the time to make your business grow.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meghan: Tall blond wearing a red Sweatshirt and sitting in the back room.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meghan</member_name><member_id>5106555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255017651000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Smart Business Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>growingsmallbusiness</urlname><id>1425260</id><group_lat>42.4599990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Growing Small Businesses</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238759902000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Location for Serious Small Business Owners April Meetup</name><id>10105414</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239721200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/growingsmallbusiness/events/10105414/</event_url></item>
