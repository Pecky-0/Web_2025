It's a little bit of short notice for some of you! We will officially meet on Friday, February 6th at 7pm at Vacationland Bowling in Saco! I look forward to seeing all of you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be responsible for paying for your own bowling and shoe rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowling! Do you need to get out and have some plain old fun?! Then this is for you. We'll meet up at 7 am spend a couple hours bowling.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in jeans and a green t-shirt....
