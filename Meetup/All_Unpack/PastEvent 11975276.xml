Jared will be organzing this meetup.  Thanks Jared for stepping in! The movie time is 7:20.

If the movie is upstairs, he will be waiting by the tables next to the giant window. If the movie is downstairs, he will be waiting behind the rope across from the refreshment stand.

If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

I encourage you to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.
