These take place in Foote Park in Branford, where there are 4 hardcourts and 8 clay courts. As always, all levels are welcome. I look forward to seeing the group veterans again and meeting new members, and being forced to get in shape as you kick my ass all over the court!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I just received information on Pilot Pen for this year. FYI, I would like to have a group go to the event for at least one of the sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if you live in Branford, follow Branford politics at BranfordSeven.com. Yup, I write it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>steve</member_name><member_id>4371204</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273493532000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennisplayers</urlname><id>967168</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Tennis Meetup of New Haven and Fairfield Counties</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272757722000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Morning Tennis</name><id>13352580</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273320000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennisplayers/events/13352580/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/1/1/global_4570625.jpeg</photo_url></item>
