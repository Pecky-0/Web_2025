Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is the search for meaning when we experience pain and suffering. It's been a staple for many college psychology courses and has inspired its readers for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Bryson's Neither Here nor There is one of his fun memoirs. This one tracks his time backpacking across Europe with his unforgettable sidekick Stephen Katz. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both books are fairly short so we should be able to get both done for January 19th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our venue will be Unwined in Manchester, a great wine bar with an atmosphere that's good for discussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal 12 person cap applies so RSVP as soon as you can. And if your plans change, please change your RSVP as soon as you can.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1295565476000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292559346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Man's Search for Meaning is Neither Here Nor There</name><id>15756544</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295481600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/15756544/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
