&lt;p&gt;Time to walk Crane's Beach and enjoy the wide open spaces of this wonderful barrier beach system - optional lunch stop to refuel at Stone Soup afterwards. Plan on a 3 hour walk with some mildly hilly sandy dune paths. Let's try for Sunday instead as Saturday's weather is not too inviting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dogs as we'll do a loop back through the dunes and dogs are strictly verboten in the dunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs $5 per car at Crane's Beach (less if you are a member of TTOR). If a few people prefer to carpool, you can meet at Ipswich MBTA station and figure out who wants to drive. Please let me know if you want to do this. I will go straight to the parking lot at Crane's Beach and meet you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will leave on time! $1 per person please to help cover my Meetup fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad weather cancels - I'll send you my phone number so you can call me if not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I limit the numbers on my walks deliberately to reduce the impact on this amazing natural resource - so please be considerate and don't sign up unless you are really coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
