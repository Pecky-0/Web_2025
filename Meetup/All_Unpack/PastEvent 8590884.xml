<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Saturday is looking like the pick of the weekend. I have a few routes in this area I want to do involving the ridge from Guyot to Lafayette. I'll throw this one out there to see if there is any interest. If anyone is interested in another part of this ridge I can be swayed to one of those. However I am looking for a good workout with 15+ miles and 5000+ elevation gain at better than booktime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;GPS coordinates&lt;/b&gt;: 44.237887, -71.547356 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=44.237887,-71.547356" target="_blank"&gt;Map of 44.237887, -71.547356&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt;: 16 miles &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation gain&lt;/b&gt;: 5119 ft  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Time&lt;/b&gt;: 10 hours and 35 minutes  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trails&lt;/b&gt;: Gale River, Twinway, North Twin &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long hike with a good amount of elevation. I am expecting to beat booktime. To sign up for this hike you should have some recent experience with hikes of this length and amount of elevation gain. Water is available at Galehead hut. A carspot is required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please keep your rsvp's up to date.
