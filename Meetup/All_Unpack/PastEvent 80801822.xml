Come with us and visit the quant galleries that host receptions with delightfully tasteful refreshments. There are Musicians, dancers, authors, historians and other entertainers that give performances and lectures throughout this scenic art colony. &lt;br /&gt;

The many folks that have done this visit always come back for more. It's just a really fantastic night out! We walk the neck, visit the open galleries, listen to music, watch entertainers, and then end up at one of the restaurants that overlook the quiet little, moon lit, harbor for drinks &amp;amp; food. THIS IS A GO-AT-YOUR-OWN-PACE type of event where no one is ever that far out-of –sight. So come enjoy the night with us and share your enthusiasm for these fine art exhibits! &lt;br /&gt;

THIS IS A SHARED EVENT WITH OTHER MEETUP GROUPS. OPEN TO ALL ADULTS. &lt;/p&gt;
