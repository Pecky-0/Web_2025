Each trail I have mapped out takes about an hour.  So whether you have a bike or want to hike - you choose.  If it rains we all could do the hike. As the group builds I would like to make these a bit more challenging or at least longer treks. But for now let's try to get as many people there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can all meet at the Ranger Station parking lot. Both trails start there.  The hike is an easy trail going around a pond.  Approx 3-4 miles.  It should take about an hour.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on who comes and skill level we have one of two choices on the bike.  Both are about an hour.  One is beginner to intermediate the other definitely intermediate.  If you have a mountain bike – that is preferred.  The paved trails aren’t perfect and there are a few spots where you have to cross unpaved trails and roads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the “Hike or Bike” I would love for us all to go to Cabby Shack in Plymouth for refreshments and a snack. Probably about 230 pm - Any takers?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring plenty of water and snacks if you need them. If you are biking please make sure your machine is in good working order and you have all the appropriate safety gear. See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My Black Toyota Pick-up with a red bandana on the Antenna</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222621140000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221451940000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Myles Standish Bike or Hike</name><id>8759319</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222012800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/8759319/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/2/3/global_5489923.jpeg</photo_url></item>
