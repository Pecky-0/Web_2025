Cuba's distinct cultural history has produced extraordinary art varying broadly in styles, methods and materials. After decades of anonymity, Cuban art has finally been gaining greater exposure and international recognition for its accomplishments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT GALERIA CUBAN &lt;br /&gt;Galería Cubana is pleased to showcase the creative, technical, and experimental achievements of Cuban artwork by featuring a range of artists at various points in their career. We carry work of the highly-trained, self-taught and even street artists. Our collection includes oils and acrylics on canvas and paper, prints, drawings, watercolors and mixed media works. This range of work has been selected to encapsulate the cultural depth, aesthetic diversity, and political edge unique to Cuban art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Moxie</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273623463000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>BMers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BMSocial</urlname><id>1333853</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Metro Hike Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272413828000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art, Wine &amp; Introductions - Art Exhibit &amp; Wine Social </name><id>13312522</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273618800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BMSocial/events/13312522/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/e/global_6944542.jpeg</photo_url></item>
