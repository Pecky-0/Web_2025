Financial savants teach us that the behavior of the market, although seemingly random, nonetheless has underlying order that emerges over time. In other words, the financial market is a chaotic unpredictable system, with predictable cycles of ups and downs. In truth, it is inevitable that the market will repeatedly rise and fall - but no one can predict exactly when these rallies and subsequent corrections will occur, only that they must.&lt;br /&gt;As investors we must be able to tolerate the necessary uncertainty and anxiety that come with attempting to master an unruly system. We must avoid the temptation to give in to our emotions, all the while retaining our faith in both the constancy of the financial market over time and our own ability to discern its underlying order. It is crucial, therefore, for us to be aware of: (1) how we deal with feeling overwhelmed; (2) the way in which we process the continuous stream of information with which we are constantly being bombarded; and, more generally (3) the characteristic defensive posture we assume in the face of uncertainty and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biography&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Buff is founder and president of Buff Capital Management, a Boston-based investment advisory firm.
