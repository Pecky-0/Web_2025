No cost to attend but the refreshments you purchase at your table. Bring your own poems for the open mic. Since we'll be at a coffee shop, we may elect to look at our own writing as per usual in our own workshop after the reading. Let's play it by ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizers sent over a flier for the event, which you can view or download from the Files section of this Meetup site: &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/122206/cafenation_flier2.pdf"&gt;http://files.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250288975000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246666106000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reading: City Lights at Cafenation</name><id>10798973</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249686000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/10798973/</event_url></item>
