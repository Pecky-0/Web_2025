Our own Mark Sherry, a certified Laughter Yoga instructor, and Ingrid, are graciously hosting this event for us. We will start the evening with a FREE 45 minute Laughter Yoga session.  Following that we will walk down the street to the Northampton Brewery to enjoy the locally brewed beers, food, and each other - maybe sitting outside on the patio, weather permitting (c'mon we're due for some permitting weather, right?) There is plenty of parking across the street in the Northampton parking garage. You do not need to be happy, have a sense of humor, or even have a reason in order to laugh.  Laughter Yoga bases itself on the philosophy of “acting happiness.” In time fake laughter becomes genuine and flows out like a fountain! Speaking of fountains, this venue is located right off of Pleasant St just behind Sylvester's Restaurant by the &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; fountain. The community room is just inside the entrance on the first floor.
