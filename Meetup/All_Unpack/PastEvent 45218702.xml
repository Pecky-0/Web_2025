There is no cost, but I would recommend getting there early. I will be there at 12:15, knowing my dad, as seating is limited, but it does go on for 3 hours. The K of C is located at 37 Main Street (exit 2 off route 93) Salem, NH. Merry Christmas to all of you, and many more are wished for you and yours' ;) hugs, susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324838632000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>fun folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dance-342</urlname><id>462174</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>Dance &amp; Activities Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1324558983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Christmas Dinner Buffet...</name><id>45218702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324834200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dance-342/events/45218702/</event_url></item>
