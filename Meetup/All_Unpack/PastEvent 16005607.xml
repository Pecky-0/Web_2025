Based on the forecast, it will truly be a winter wonderland out there!  Lots of quiet trails and - if you love birds - lots of hungry birds will eat out of your hand! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to Village Pancake House: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.villagepancakehouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.villagepancakehouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.villagepan...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....and here is their great menu! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.villagepancakehouse.com/menu.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.villagepancakehouse.com/menu.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.villagepan...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 10:30 for coffee and conversation, then at close to 11:00 we can place our orders; that way, we can opt for either breakfast or lunch.  Breakfast is served all day and they start serving lunch at around 11:00.  From there we will head for our hike.  Here is the link to Ipswich River: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massaudubo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will last about 2 hours or so, with the option of a longer hike for those who choose to join us.  Hiking distance will be a function of trail conditions and how well packed they are by that time.  Estimate about 3 miles in 2 hours - and for the longer portion another mile or two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boots or hiking shoes with sturdy grips and micro spikes are recommended, along with a hiking pole if you have one.  Snowshoes will be fine too.  While most of our hike is on flat ground, there are areas of moderate slopes as well.  They do not allow cross country skis and also no pets.  Bring along bird seed for the birds (I'll have some extra seed with me), plus a camera (if you have one) and hot chocolate for the trail! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It promises to be a fun filled day!  Let me know if you need the directions to Village Pancake House.  It is located right at the intersection of Route 133 and 1 A in Rowley.   Let's meet inside the door; if you run a few minutes late, ask for Randy's Table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just inside near front door at around 10:25 - 10:30; if you run late, ask for "Randy's Table."</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Randy</member_name><member_id>10613717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1295384526000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294742142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Breakfast Social and Hike!</name><id>16005607</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295278200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/16005607/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/b/global_20743755.jpeg</photo_url></item>
