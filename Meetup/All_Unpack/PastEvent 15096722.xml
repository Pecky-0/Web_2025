Is it entertainment or politics? They seem bizarrely interchangeable nowadays. But I'm gonna check it out, thanks to a non-stop, luxury bus leaving from North Station at 1:30am on 10/30 and returning at 1:30am on 10/31. The cost of the bus is $110, and the rally is free. There will be time before and after the rally to visit the free museums (which are right there). Anyone want to come with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;From the official Rally to Restore Sanity website:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take it anymore!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who among us has not wanted to open their window and shout that at the top of their lungs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because we’re looking for those people. We’re looking for the people who think shouting is annoying, counterproductive, and terrible for your throat; who feel that the loudest voices shouldn’t be the only ones that get heard; and who believe that the only time it’s appropriate to draw a Hitler mustache on someone is when that person is actually Hitler. Or Charlie Chaplin in certain roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you one of those people? Excellent. Then we’d like you to join us in Washington, DC on October 30 — a date of no significance whatsoever — at the Daily Show’s “Rally to Restore Sanity.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ours is a rally for the people who’ve been too busy to go to rallies, who actually have lives and families and jobs (or are looking for jobs) — not so much the Silent Majority as the Busy Majority. If we had to sum up the political view of our participants in a single sentence… we couldn’t. That’s sort of the point.
