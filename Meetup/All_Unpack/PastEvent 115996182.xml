&lt;p&gt;Now that we have some daylight after work, I'm going to start offering some short, after work hikes, probably mostly at Northwest Park, as that's convenient to both home and work for me.  These will be more of a walk in the woods than a serious hike.  Since we've gained a little daylight, I've moved the start time to 5:45 with a hike departure no later than 6:00.  We'll walk about 3 miles in about 1.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walks here will cover rolling trails, and most have water views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet in the parking lot at 5:45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids and leashed dogs welcome.  I'll have my two dogs with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check back that morning to see if I have updated the plans based on weather or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested, pizza after at the nearby (and very good) Tunxis Grill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be re-posting this walk on a regular basis weeknights, generally Tuesday or Thursday, in the coming weeks.  Hope you can join me sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Gloria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note about dogs: While this is a dog-friendly hike, the dog owners need to be responsible. Park rules require leashes. If you choose to break that rule and let your dog off the leash, please be sure it is okay with the other hikers (some of whom may not be dog people) and be sure you can control your dog when off leash. Finally, please be prepared and clean up after your dog when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
