We'll start with dinner and drinks at Diva Indian Bistro at 5:30PM, then we'll proceed to the opening reception for Arabian Nights at Balch Arena Theater.  Following the reception, we'll enjoy a play performed by our students and described as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time in Persia...a Shahryar, brokenhearted by his wife's infidelity, was driven to murder.  He resolved to marry a new virgin every evening and, in the morning, to have her beheaded.  He had killed three thousand unfortunate women by the time he was introduced to Scheherazade, the vizier's daughter.  To save her life, Scheherazade spins hypnotic tales of genies, jesters, thieves and kings, gaining her freedom by eventually winning Shahryar's heart.  Amidst a thousand tales of honor, revenge and humor, the power of storytelling is tested, the simple is made sublime, and only love emerges victorious.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner is Dutch treat and tickets to the play are only $7 so this should be a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.divaindianbistro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.divaindian...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARABIAN NIGHTS&lt;br /&gt;By Mary Zimmerman&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Luke Jorgensen&lt;br /&gt;April 12-16, 2011 at 8:00 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;Tickets: $7.00 Tufts ID&lt;br /&gt;4/12 - $7.00 tickets/opening night reception&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1302702996000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284049527000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indian Dinner and Arabian Nights</name><id>14711844</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1302643800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/14711844/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/global_17826136.jpeg</photo_url></item>
