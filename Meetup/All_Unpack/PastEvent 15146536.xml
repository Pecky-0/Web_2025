If you are wondering why there so few RSVPs, take a look at this &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/messages/boards/thread/9907478"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;.  Please be respectful of others who may want to RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, the game that almost everyone has an opinion on.  Most people either love or hate this game.  For those of you who *love* it, this event is for you.  Let's play a good ol' fashioned game of Monopoly, with paper cash, old school prices and dice you have to roll yourself.  It may even turn into a friendly competition or tournament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a favorite ruleset or other version of the game, please mention it and convince us why it is awesome and we'll try and make room for it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food theme for this Mini-Meetup will be &amp;quot;chips&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dip&amp;quot;.  Please feel free to bring or make your favorite &amp;quot;chip&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dip&amp;quot;, otherwise will have some defaults on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the location:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickman Street is located between the Commons and the water.  Parking on Pickman can be tight, but there should be ample parking along either Pleasant Street (by the Commons) or Collins Street (by the water)&lt;br /&gt;It will take place on the third floor unit.&lt;br /&gt;Note: there will be two cats present that will be very very sad if they have to get locked up.  They are very polite however.  If anyone would like to attend but has allegeries please send me a private message.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ryan</member_name><member_id>8995629</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289924480000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287416096000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mini-Meetup: Monopoly Anonymous </name><id>15146536</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289671200000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/15146536/</event_url></item>
