The next Meetup for the Hartford Russian Language Group will be on Tuesday January 8th at 7:00 and we will continue to meet on the second Tuesday of each month from here on out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have held the last three meetings in the back meeting room at the Wood-n-Tap, 99 Sisson Ave, Hartford, CT.  The Wood-n-Tap is a nice, casual place with good food.  As before, I have not arranged for any formal meal, we can simply order off the menu as we please.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first meetings have been basically informal events.  Most of our last meeting was conducted in Russian, but do not let that discourage you if you are a beginner like me, simply bring along a dictionary and jump right in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been growing slowly each month and hope to see some new faces this month! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible next week!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.
