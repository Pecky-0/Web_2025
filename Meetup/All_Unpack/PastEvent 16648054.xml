<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;This hike is being coordinated/cross-posted with the Boston Hiking Meetup as well. &amp;nbsp;We have decided to definitely include Eisenhower (via Crawford) in this hike. &amp;nbsp;If you are not interested in attempting more than just Monroe, please opt out of this hike. &amp;nbsp;Options to be decided at the trailhead include a small group attempting Washington and the option of breaking the group out according to pace (one faster, one more moderate). This will NOT be a traverse. &amp;nbsp;We will try to get updated trail information posted tonight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a traverse, so there will be no need to carpool to another location.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll ascend to the summit of Monroe via Ammonoosuc to the Crawford Path, which connects almost immediately with the Monroe Loop to the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for winter cold and potentially poor weather conditions. DO NOT WEAR COTTON OR DENIM. This is dangerous in cold weather. If you have questions about how to prepare or how to dress, ask them in advance. This is a wet trail. &amp;nbsp;Come prepared for ice and to stay dry!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answers to FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traction (crampons) and head lamps will be required. &amp;nbsp;Microspikes will not be sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunrise is at 7:00 am. Sunset will be at 7:07 pm. &amp;nbsp;This is BEFORE the official start of spring, which is at 7:21 PM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last leg of this hike is *VERY EXPOSED*. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hut will be closed. &amp;nbsp;If we want to, we can use the "dungeon" for shelter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a full winter hike. &amp;nbsp;You WILL need traction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a very wet trail, so expect ICY conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will START AND FINISH TOGETHER. If you cannot hold your speed down to match that of the group (if necessary), this is not the hike for you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I (Kate) am not a speedy hiker, but I do keep a steady pace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the conditions are prohibitive, we have no qualms about turning around. The mountain will be there another day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My (Kate's) hikes area always dog friendly, but please know the limits and abilities of your dog in cold weather and snow. I may have my dogs with me on this hike, depending on the conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will watch the weather carefully and post weather updates during the week leading up to the hike. We will rely on NOAA and MWObs for my forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of the payoff comes in the form of great views &amp;amp; enjoying the outdoors, SO if the weather looks like it will be miserable, we will reschedule. Please plan accordingly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #FF0000"&gt;RSVP Questions are not optional - We may delete your 'going' RSVP and will not take you from the waiting list if we don't see your answers. &amp;nbsp; If you do not provide us with a phone number to try and contact you on the morning of the hike (if necessary), we will NOT wait for you at the trailhead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I (Kate) will provide attendees with my cell phone number in advance of the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book time is about 6 hrs, 20 minutes and 7 miles&lt;/strong&gt;. Plan on it taking possibly more with the winter conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail (to Lakes of the Clouds Hut (5012'))&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.1 miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2500 ft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 hrs 50 min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the parking lot, this trail follows a path trhough the woods, crossing Franklin Brook at .3 miles then passing over a double pipeline as it skirts around the Base Station area. &amp;nbsp;It joins the old route of the trail at the edge of the Ammonoosuc River at 1.0 miles after a slight descent. &amp;nbsp;The main trail bears right along the river, following the old route for the rest of the way. &amp;nbsp;It ascends mostly by easy grades, &amp;nbsp;though with some rought footing, crossing Monroe Brook at 1.7 miles. &amp;nbsp;At 2.1 miles it crosses the outlet of Gem Pool a beautiful emerald pool at the foot of a cascade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the very steep, rough ascent begins. &amp;nbsp;At 2.3 miles a side path (sign) leads right about 80 yards to a spectaular viewpoint at the foot of the gorge. &amp;nbsp;Above this point, the main brook falls about 600 feet down a steep trough in the mountainside at an average angle of 45 degrees while another brook a short distance to the north does the same and these two spectacular water slides meet in a pool at the foot of the gorge. &amp;nbsp;The main trail continues its steep ascent, passes an outlook over the cascades to the right of the trail and at 2.5 miles crosses the main brook on flat ledges at the head of the highest fall, a striking viewpoint. &amp;nbsp;The grade now begins to ease and the trail crosses several more brooks. &amp;nbsp;Ledges become more frequent and the scrub becomes smaller and more sparse. &amp;nbsp;At 3.0 miles, the trail emerges from the scrub and follows a line of cairns directly up some rock slabs (which are slippery when wet/icy), passes through one last patch of scrub and reaches the Crawford Path at the south side of the Lakes of the Clouds Hut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crawford Path (from the Lakes of the Clouds Hut to the Summit of Monroe)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negligible distance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crawford Path now climbs up to the base of Mt. Monroe, where the north end of the Mout Monroe loop diverges right to cross both summits of Monroe, affording excellent views. &amp;nbsp;The loop over the summits is about the same length as the paralell section of the Crawford Path but requires about 350 feet more climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Monroe Loop (to the summit of Mt. Monroe)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;.8 miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;350 feet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20 minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short trail runs paralell to the Crawford path and passes over the summits of Mt. Monroe and Little Monroe. &amp;nbsp;The views are fine but the summits are &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;very exposed to the weather&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The trail diverges from the Crawford Path 6.3 miles from Mt. Clinton Rd and quickly ascends the minor crag called Little Monreo, then descends into the shallow, grassy sag beyond. &amp;nbsp;It then climbs steeply to the summit of Mt. Monroe at .4 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Totals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---------&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 hrs 20 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
