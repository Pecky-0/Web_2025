&lt;p&gt;The ICA tour department and the Visual Experience Manager are very enthusiastic about putting this together for us! They have booked a tour guide who is one of the museums best educators and are offering a discounted admission price.  The admission cost will be $10 per person or $8 with a student ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there people who would like to attend but are unable due to financial constraints, one Meetup member has generously offered to help offset admission costs to this event for some people who are in that situation.  Feel free to send me an email if you would like more information regarding help with admission costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to James H. for contacting the ICA to make this event happen!&lt;/p&gt;
