Please join us for a few miles of walking, talking and gazing at the beautiful landscape of Western Connecticut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at Devil's Den, which is a nature preserve in Weston, CT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN:  The group will hike mostly level ground, without steep inclines, and will enjoy a scenic overlook.  We would like to spend around 3 hours in the woods, including breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at 8:15 a.m. (we will converge at the commuter parking lot on Route 34 in Orange; take Route 15, exit 58). We will leave from there at 8:30, arriving at Devil's Den around 9:00.  For those of you who plan to meet us in Weston, please let the group know in advance, so that we can be sure to make contact before we head into the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: At least one bottle of WATER, and a snack.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Warm winter boots, warm layers, hat and gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dot/LIB/dot/Documents/dtravelroad/orange.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Map of Commuter Parking Lot in Orange (Take Route 15, exit 58)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;saddr=CT-34+%26+Abbey+Ct,+Orange,+CT+06477&amp;amp;daddr=33+Pent+Rd,+Weston,+CT+06883+(Nature+Conservancy+Devil%27s+Den)&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=%3BFUY5dQIdPhCg-yEyWkZzGGNQXg&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;sll=41.245289,-73.173065&amp;amp;sspn=0.270016,0.617981&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.235995,-73.21701&amp;amp;spn=0.270054,0.617981&amp;amp;z=11" target="_blank"&gt;Directions from Commuter Lot to Pent Road / Devil's Den &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to drive yourself, the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/connecticut/preserves/art17963.html" target="_blank"&gt;Park Website&lt;/a&gt; offers directions, or please see &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=+pent+road,+weston,+ct&amp;amp;sll=41.236318,-73.393285&amp;amp;sspn=0.007971,0.019312&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.236156,-73.394337&amp;amp;spn=0.007971,0.019312&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;g=pent+road,+weston,+ct&amp;amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank"&gt;Google Maps (Pent Road dead-ends at the Devil's Den preserve's main parking area).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is limited parking at the entrance, so we encourage you to carpool.
