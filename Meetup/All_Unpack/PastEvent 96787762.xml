Boston's very own Resolution Ball is taking place this year at the Boston Sheraton, right in the heart of the Back Bay area. There will be a live band, free champagne toast, and party favors.........plenty of revelry and a glamourous atmosphere - dress to impress!!! Past Resolution Balls offered a lively singles scene!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note when buying tickets to the Resolution Ball: there is both a sit-down dinner and a cocktail party after the dinner.  This meet-up is for the cocktail party only ( more fun than the dinner I think !!) You can buy tickets at Boston Event Guide www.bostoneventguide.com ( make sure to buy a ticket for the  cocktail party only if you aren't interested in attending the dinner! ). Please note ticket prices will increase as tickets sell out. If you want "in on the fun" and to save money, buy your ticket sooner rather than later...............cocktail party ticket price on 12/27/12 was $79.00.  Let's ring in 2013 Boston-style!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357023993000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356670465000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Upscale New Year's Eve - Boston's Resolution Ball !!</name><id>96787762</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357012800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/96787762/</event_url></item>
