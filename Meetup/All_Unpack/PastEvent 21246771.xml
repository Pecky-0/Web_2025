where Royal guests would stay and be entertained. In later eras
they would also become merchant homes or homes of the wealthy. But,
their initial evolution was where the royal families and selected
ministers got together in a congenial environment to discuss
affairs of state, as they dined and were entertained. The custom
was for hundreds of the best cooks and entertainers to be brought
from around the state to serve the royal families and their guests.
The entertainment and the food was always the best the state had to
offer. And because of the number of cooks they were known to try
new and creative dishes to distinguish themselves before the royal
family. It is because of this beginning that Haveli's over time
became known as keepers of Indian traditions and cuisines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laxman Sharma (owner/chef) has continued this tradition of
serving the King and Queen at Haveli India in Middletown
Connecticut. As, Laxman states : his new King and Queen are the
guests, who come to Haveli India to be dined and pampered by his
always polite and attentive staff. Here you will find food fit for
a King or a Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has dined here can attest to the wonderfully tasteful
and aromatic dishes...all served at your request. From the time you
