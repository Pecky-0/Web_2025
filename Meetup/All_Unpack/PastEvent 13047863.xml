The plan from now on is to have these every second Sunday, same time, same location. This one is the week before the big, annual Boston Area Tournament. Register online at &lt;a href="http://www.sasj.com/bat2010/entry.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sasj.com/bat2010/entry.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sasj.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by April 5th if you want to compete. I'll bring a clock to the Meetup if anyone wants to practice playing a tournament-style game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent Meetups have lasted 2-3 hours, with some folks staying for two, three or even four games, and some folks leaving after just one. Turnout has been great the last few months, around 10-20! Skill and experience has ranged too, from novice players to tournament players. One thing has stayed the same, and that's everyone's fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a board if you have one, but you are welcome to come even if you don't have one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've put up several tips for improving your Scrabble play at this &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston/pages/Tips_for_Improving_Your_Play/"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;. The first tip may be to take a peak at the Cross Tables &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.cross-tables.com/download/CHEAT_PRO.pdf"&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;--a list of two letter and other highly playable words. It's very helpful to memorize the two letter words. From now on I plan to provide a list of two and three letter words for folks to use as they are comfortable at the Meetup. Some folks may be okay using this &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; during the game--ask first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the space: Au Bon Pain has been very accommodating of us. Usually they are not very busy on Sundays and I think they appreciate our business. However, they have asked that we stay in just one corner of the restaurant, and try not to move furniture around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the dollar is voluntary--it goes to cover Meetup's monthly fees, and nobody will be turned away for not having funds. I ask that you bring a dollar once a month, which will cover you for the whole month even if you come to more than one game. Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Quinten</member_name><member_id>9980941</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271175002000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Word Freaks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston</urlname><id>1385528</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Scrabble Enthusiasts of (Greater) Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270049525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday before Boston Area Tournament Scrabble Meetup (April 11)</name><id>13047863</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271001600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston/events/13047863/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/e/global_7376798.jpeg</photo_url></item>
