Have some calamari and wine and think how it would be if you were sitting by the sea on a Greek island!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the restaurant's website at www.aegeanrestaurants.com.  There is free parking and you can get to it by the T on the number 70 and 70A bus from Central Square in Cambridge.  Get off at Arsenal and Arlington Street.  The restaurant is at the corner there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to call me I can be reached on my cell phone at 617-448-5820.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christos&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181085159000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179591953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greek restaurant dinner outing</name><id>5795528</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180742400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/5795528/</event_url></item>
