I thought February might be a quite enough month in which to hold this first one.  &lt;br /&gt;Due to the structure of a murder mystery dinner the number of participants is strictly limited. This is why I thought we'd do a series so that anyone interested can participate at some point. This means that only hosts can attend more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will post more about the setting, the meal, etc. as time draws closer and I see you the group is going to be. We will make this a structured pot luck because our time will be spent figuring our who done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one time I participated in a similar event it was tons of fun! Be prepared to stay in character, and solve the mystery. There will be a prize!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you RSVP in the affirmative you must be sure you can attend. Having even one person missing results in difficulties in running this type of event. Therefore if you RSVP be aware that a change in your RSVP that does not involve someone interacting with a stranger in a uniform will be cause for  temporary suspension from the club.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298769358000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295362398000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Murder Mystery Dinner</name><id>16091473</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298678400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/16091473/</event_url></item>
