I will likely incorporate some partnered moves (so find a partner please) but it will be easy enough for the non-dancer to do and will complete the choreography some time this summer and post the video of the dance so people can practice at home. For anyone interested, I can also host some practice sessions before hand for anyone interested at YogaOne in Seekonk, where I teach yoga.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351385551000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342118243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FlashMob to "We are young" in Salem and in costume</name><id>73075342</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351374300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/73075342/</event_url></item>
