<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Meetup to jam, rehearse, play/arrange your songs, and if ready record.    Also plan for gigs, form bands, play open mikes, etc.  This meetup is for you and the goal is to enhance your music career/hobby.  Meetup will be from 2PM until 6PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I play keys in an Open Mike house band that occurs Tuesday Nite at 9PM, near Watertown Center  - any competent musician interested can come and play solo or with our band backing them up, and rehearse at the meetup if desired.  Let me know if interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a large turn out we will schedule various interests at various times during the meetup (Jam, work on songs, play various genres, record, etc)  and can expand the time to from 1 till 7PM.  Generally we start with introductions and goals, and play some simpler group songs (blues, etc), and then go around the group allowing each person to proceed to more detailed agendas.  If there is an upcoming gig we will then focus on that.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>9500592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267556790000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Musicians &amp; Songwriters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild</urlname><id>1420875</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The NEW England Singer Songwriter Musician Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267030942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jam Rehearsal Recording Session #6</name><id>12695548</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267383600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild/events/12695548/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/global_11501162.jpeg</photo_url></item>
