Complete with vibes, horns, and truckloads of soul this venue and band is about having fun, letting loose in the classic Motown-style dance dive with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I've re-scheduled this to Thursday night June 28th ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Show starts at 9p, just come out for a couple of hours.  11p - 7a is 8 full hours so you'll be fine at the office :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183589101000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-live-music</urlname><id>444171</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Live Music</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181871188000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cantab Lounge - Motown night (rescheduled)</name><id>5893264</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183077000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-live-music/events/5893264/</event_url></item>
