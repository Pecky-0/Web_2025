Benjamin Zander, one of Boston's preeminent conductors, wears many hats: he conducts full seasons with the Boston Philharmonic and NEC's Youth Philharmonic Orchestra, and circles the globe both as a conductor and inspirational speaker.  Tonight is an opportunity to experience his work with NEC's top College-level orchestral students as he conducts the NEC Philharmonia.  The orchestra will be performing works by Benjamin Britten and Anton Bruckner, the latter of which Zander was nominated for a Grammy award for recording.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about this concert, go to &lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-philharmonia-zander" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-philharmonia-zander" target="_blank"&gt;http://necmusic.edu/n...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm, but let's meet up at 7:30, so the group has a chance to get good seats and socialize before the concert.  We usually end up sitting in the left side of the back full row of the center floor section, since this affords a good view of the entire orchestra, is open to the ceiling, and is easy to describe and find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Jordan Hall:&lt;br /&gt;The hall is located at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=jordan+Hall,+Boston+MA&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=59.467068,135.263672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.342781,-71.085577&amp;amp;spn=0.006883,0.020599&amp;amp;z=17" target="_blank"&gt;the corner of Huntington and Gainsborough streets&lt;/a&gt;, about a block south of the Symphony T stop on the Green Line.  Look for the building with the YMCA sign on top of it--it's in that building.  The main entrance is reached from Gainsborough Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's program will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Britten Sinfonia da Requiem   &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqDgfJcuO_w" target="_blank"&gt;listen to the last movement here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Bruckner's Symphony No. 5     &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW8UCqR1l3c" target="_blank"&gt;listen to the last movement here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will stand in the lobby until 7:45, after which I will join the group, either in the left section of the main floor or upstairs to the left-middle balcony section (if it's open.)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Will</member_name><member_id>7339843</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1268440489000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266128228000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Classical Concert Series: Zander conducts Britten &amp; Bruckner</name><id>12600534</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268267400000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12600534/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/5/global_10915013.jpeg</photo_url></item>
