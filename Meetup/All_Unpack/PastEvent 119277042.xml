&lt;p&gt;Ruth Reichl has written a wonderful book, "For You Mom, Finally", a homage to her mother.  So often we fail to see our mothers as a product of their own circumstances, and fail to appreciate all that they have done to give us a better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the book out and let's discuss our mother's and our complicated relationships with them.  Please read the book, it is a short, easy read.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sue Clever</member_name><member_id>4514994</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1370699405000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1368501596000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book Discussion: For You Mom, Finally - by Ruth Reichl</name><id>119277042</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1370646000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/119277042/</event_url></item>
