The crafty thieves have a devious plan that will let them all retire and live like kings- all that stands between them and victory are a dedicated group of security guards. Things were going fairly smoothly... until somebody broke into the medieval weapons display and started swinging swords around! Will you join the guards and preserve history, or the thieves and make money?  Pick a side and join in on this 2-hour long foam-sword swinging battle for ages 6 and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call us at 781-270-4800 to pre-register; $15/member, $20/nonmember. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296868027000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295546486000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buddy Night:  Madcap Museum</name><id>16121028</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296864000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/16121028/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/9/global_6162841.jpeg</photo_url></item>
