&lt;p&gt;Everyone will gather in a circle, and Jessica will talk about how she found out she was a medium, what she does, and how she does it. She will then call the ancestors, and give an offering to them, and then the fun &lt;br /&gt;

 begins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She will start by going around in a circle, and people can let her know what people or animals they want to connect with, and then she will speak for the spirits as they come for everyone in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She will also bring some wine and some take home gift bags for everyone with a candle, and some of her ancestor incense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meet up is $20.00 per person, and space is limited to 20 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier, please bring CASH for Jessica, so she can pay the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 If you are unable to get on the list, RSVP for the waiting list, and if there is enough people, we will schedule another night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also be meeting for dinner at Southside Grill down the street from Terrapin Traders and their website is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://southsidemargaritafactory.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://southsidemargaritafactory.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on coming to dinner, please answer the question, with how many will be in your party to attend so I can make reservations- Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this will be great fun, and a good time to do this, as it is still during the time when the veils are the thinnest!:)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park on the main street and come in the front door!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tala</member_name><member_id>5511934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353250596000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Wiccans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wiccan-169</urlname><id>793389</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.0100021362</group_lon><name>Central Mass Wiccan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347410295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Messages From the Spirit World with Jessica</name><id>81974802</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>14400000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353196800000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wiccan-169/events/81974802/</event_url></item>
