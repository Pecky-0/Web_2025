&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The East Bay Bike Path is a great say to view the New England coast while getting great exercise whether riding the whole path or just a portion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East Bay Bike Path, filled with amazing views of the Narragansett Bay, abundant plant life and the always great feeling of being by the Rhode Island coast. It's amazing how an abandoned railway can turn into a scenic, recreational treasure, ideal for bicyclists, joggers, in-line skaters and walkers. The bike path starts in the great City of Providence, then goes through posh Barrington, busy and interesting Warren and ends in Bristol, a beautiful town with Patriotic pride, historic buildings and homes, and great little shops and restaurants.The 10-ft. wide path is exceptionally well-maintained and bikers seem to be more respectful than those on certain Massachusetts bike trails that seem to have a maniacal sense of self-entitlement and ownership of the given path. It's a relaxing experience, with a chance to view various perspectives of the Bay, cross pleasant bridges, rest at welcoming benches, and places to eat along the way. If you're lucky, a Del's Lemonade truck will await you with some fabulous frozen lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average speed of this ride should be between 13 &amp;amp; 15 mph. I recommend Road bikes or hybrids. Please make sure you have a helmet or I cannot allow you to ride with our group. The total mileage is about 29 miles so plan your schedule accordingly. Rail trails are flat and free of car traffic except for a few road crossings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will stop for a quick bite to eat at one of the restaurants along the path down in Bristol..Plan on being finished with this ride by 4pm..if not sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
