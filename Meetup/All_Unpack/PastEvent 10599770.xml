I think it would be nice to head from Inman down to Harvard and along the Charles for a bit and back.  We can make a group decision on the distance - 3-6 miles could be good.  I run 8-9 min/mile generally so others w/ that sort of pace would be good.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can join in!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the little park at the corner of Beacon/Cambridge/Hampshire Streets</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244899140000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244422961000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday morning run for us non 9-5'ers :)</name><id>10599770</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244638800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10599770/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
