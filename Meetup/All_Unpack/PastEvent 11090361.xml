People of all skill levels come to share ideas, patterns, new resourcess and yarn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the September Meet-up, folks have decided that they would like to bring &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; yarn to swap (is there such a thing?!)  So, if you want to exchange yarn, or are looking for differenct yarn, or you just want to make room at home for more yarn, bring what you feel you'd like to part with, and maybe someone else can use it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us, to share, knit together, and for conversation,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It will be meeting on the second TUESDAY OF EACH MONTH, ON-G0ING, at the Starbucks, at 1005 Main Street, Newington.  I'll have a "Meet-up" sign at the table, and will be knitting.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>5364788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255466115000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Knitters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>knitting-1358</urlname><id>757407</id><group_lat>41.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>The Newington Knitting Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250035971000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Newington Knitting September Meetup</name><id>11090361</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252450800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/knitting-1358/events/11090361/</event_url></item>
