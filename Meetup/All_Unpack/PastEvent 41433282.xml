&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showtime is 5:55PM, I will be at the theater by 5, we will head in for seats about 5:25.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like fun Denzel Washington and Ryan Renolds in the same flick....awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I arrive at the theater an hour before the show to start gathering people and we head in for seats about 30 minutes before the show so we can sit together.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; This also allows us to take turns getting snacks, etc., before the previews start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I like to see these movies during opening weekend, it is usually a good idea to buy your tickets ahead of time....especially if it is a big movie with lots of buzz.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after and bring cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Plot Summary:&lt;/span&gt; Oscar winner Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds star in the action-thriller "Safe House." Washington plays the most dangerous renegade from the CIA, who comes back onto the grid after a decade on the run. When the South African safe house he's remanded to is attacked by mercenaries, a rookie operative (Reynolds) escapes with him. Now, the unlikely allies must stay alive long enough to uncover who wants them dead. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

For the past year, Matt Weston has been frustrated by his inactive, backwater post in Cape Town. A "housekeeper" who aspires to be a full-fledged agent, the loyal company man has been waiting for an opportunity to prove himself. When the first and only occupant he's had proves to be the most dangerous man he's ever met, Weston readies for duty. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Tobin Frost has eluded capture for almost a decade. One of the best ops men that the CIA's known, the ex-intelligence officer has given up assets and sold military intel to anyone with cash since he turned. From trading secrets to North Korea to aiding splinter cells, the damage he's done to the U.S. is immeasurable. And he's now back on the reservation with a secret. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

As soon as Frost is brought in for debriefing, mercenaries come and tear apart Weston's safe house. Barely escaping, the unlikely partners must discover if their attackers have been sent by terrorists or someone on the inside who will kill anyone standing in the way. Now it's up to Weston to figure out who he can trust before they're both eliminated from the game. &lt;br /&gt;
