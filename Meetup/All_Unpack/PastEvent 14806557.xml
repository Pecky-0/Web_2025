Seems there have been more questions arising out of that meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am suggesting we have an additional meeting on Wednesday night, September 29th at 6:00 at Bullock Hangar. I will ask Armand to attend again. Chaiman Kit Walker said he'd be there also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is open to anyone on KFIT, not just the FPA.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the questions/answers/concerns are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kind of approaches would be available after the new runway goes in? Gale didn't know if we'd get anything.&lt;br /&gt;Why not do some soil testing to see if the soil is useable for a runway before spending monies on photographs and plans?&lt;br /&gt;Will the new runway be an improvement or just a change? &lt;br /&gt;We all thought it was a fact that it had to be done, Gale said otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;If the 5000 ft is displaced, will jets be able to use it still?&lt;br /&gt;If we just re did the current 32/14, wouldn't that be less disruptive and keep the same non precision    approaches?&lt;br /&gt;Can FIT maintain 2/20 if 32/14 stays?&lt;br /&gt;What about the taxiways and run up areas for the new runway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyhaven had input from their users.
