So,&amp;nbsp;please plan to meet&amp;nbsp;by 6:30 p.m. in the outer lobby of the AMC Framingham. I will see who is there at 6:30 and will then&amp;nbsp;get in line for tickets for everyone.&amp;nbsp; If you won't be able to make it, PLEASE update your RSVP so I know whether to look for you or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discount tickets: I will have discount coupons available so we can get tickets for $8.00 each. (Retail price is $10.50.) I will collect $8 in cash from each person and then I'll get in line to buy tickets for all. Exact change is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the movie, those who want to are welcome to go out to a local restaurant to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1979, a group of friends in a small Ohio town witness a catastrophic train crash while making a super 8 movie and soon suspect that it was not an accident. Shortly after, unusual disappearances and inexplicable events begin to take place in town, and the local Deputy tries to uncover the truth - something more terrifying than any of them could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;
