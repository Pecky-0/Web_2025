&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : x-large"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Trip to Bass Pro Shops in Foxboro!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get out in the real world and raise some awareness by having some fun w/our bully brigade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/428846_4397271058286_1337204485_n.jpg" width="362" height="249" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 0px auto ; display : block"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never been to Bass Pro, come with us and check it out! Dogs are welcomed (except for in the food areas), and this excursion is GREAT socialization! Meet some people, meet some dogs, work some training, bring 'em on the elevators, check out the dog-supply section, take some pictures &amp;amp; show everybody how great these guys can really be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also several, relatively-short trails outback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet us in front of the store at 11:00a for a casual outing w/fellow bully-lovers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All breeds &amp;amp; ages welcome; bring a friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is a public venue, and you need to conduct yourself (and your dog!) appropriately. Here is a reminder about the NEBBC etiquette:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a friendly reminder regarding etiquette at NEBBC-hosted/sponsored events, but nevertheless needs to be taken very seriously and is expected to be followed, especially considering the size of the club and all the newbies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog/Handler Etiquette:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ NO flexi-leashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Avoid head-on greetings between dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Until you are familiar with individual dogs AND handlers, contact between dogs must be kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Prevent your dog from lunging on leash, whether it is in play or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Dog(s) must be kept under owner control at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Do not allow your dog to surprise, or "sneak up on" other dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ A VERY important note: Just because two dogs are friendly, does not necessarily mean they are going to be friendly with each other. Make no assumptions and DO NOT LET YOUR DOG GREET ANOTHER DOG until you have asked and BEEN GIVEN PERMISSION by the owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ If your dog is reactive, use your best judgement as far as attending. (Be up front, and give everyone their space. Do not "test" if your dog will be ok by letting him go up to unsuspecting dogs/handlers if you've known him to be aggressive toward either.) Muzzling is an option and an opportunity to still expose your dog while keeping everyone safe. Take all necessary precautions. You are still representing our club and our dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Dog must be wearing a securely fitting collar/harness or combo thereof with NO chance of slipping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
