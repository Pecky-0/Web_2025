I know canvassing door to door doesn't excite most people but if the media won't give Dr. Paul a fair shake then we need to spread the word ourselves. Most folks DO NOT use the internet like we do and these voters have got to get that information somehow - that somehow is us. - Earl L. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;a href="http://ronpaul.meetup.com/6/calendar/6753577/"&gt;http://ronpaul.meetup...&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    We've taken Ron Paul from nowhere in the polls to 8%. We can get him up above McCain and Giuliani for sure, but it's going to take a lot of work on our part. Come join this effort to help Dr Paul win NH. Our founding fathers risked their lives and fortunes for freedom. All we need to do is knock on doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    We're going to make a big push to canvas on Dec 1st. We will be getting folks in from around the country to help out, and throw a big rally in the evening, hopefully with Ron Paul there to say thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    For out of state folks. If you have a large meetup, please take RSVPs from your meetup, then have your meetup lead RSVP here with a total count. For folks out of state needing a place to stay, please register at Operation Live Free or Die. This organization is supported by the grassroots in NH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Unless you get packets independently, please meet at campaign HQ at 10am to get packets.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196694319000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196272332000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boots on the Ground in NH </name><id>6819180</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196521200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/6819180/</event_url></item>
