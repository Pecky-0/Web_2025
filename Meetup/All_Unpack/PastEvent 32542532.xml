The trails will run from in between Uncanoonuc Lake, South Uncanoonuc Mtn. and Mountain Road. Some of the trail segments we will end up on are on the Summit Trail, Link Trail, Bickford Trail and various snowmobile trails that are unnamed on the map. There also appears to be a mountain bike trail that isn't on the map at all.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Depending on what trails we decide to explore the hike will range in between 2-3 miles. There are a few places on the hike the dogs can go wading/swimming if they chose.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The hike will be going up and down hill depending on the terrain at the moment ranging between an elevation of approximately 650-950 feet. This means at most the elevation gain will be 300 feet from the starting point but usually somewhat lower.&lt;/p&gt;
