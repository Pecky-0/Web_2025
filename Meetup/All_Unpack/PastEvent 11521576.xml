<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Red Sox are playing the Angels in the American League Division Series. Game 3 is at Fenway on Sun., 10/11. The start time is set for 12pm (although it could begin at 3:30pm depending on the result of the Dodgers/Cardinals game Saturday night). I'll be watching the Red Sox game at home. Why don't you come join me? I have some beer and snacks to get us started. We can also order pizza from The Upper Crust down the street. My TV isn't all that fancy, but it'll get the job done. I can seat six people comfortably. If there's enough demand, I might be able to get more chairs or people can rotate sitting on the floor. If the game time changes from 12pm to 3:30pm, I'll update the event listing and email/text/call everyone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick</member_name><member_id>8504559</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255647913000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254424607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Watch the Red Sox vs. Angels Playoff Game at Nick's Place</name><id>11521576</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255276800000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11521576/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/5/global_11128517.jpeg</photo_url></item>
