Easy-pace. The ride leader is Mark Abraham (matissepicasso@gmail.com), the Elm City Cycling member who lead Sunday's bike tour of Fair Haven, which by the way was excellent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Unfortunately, I will be unable to attend this event myself, as work responsibilities call that night. However, those of you who went on the Sunday Fair Haven ride can attest that the ride leader, Mark, is great so I feel that the ride will be in good hands. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541735000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183997789000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Night Ice Cream Ride</name><id>5996131</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184191200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5996131/</event_url></item>
