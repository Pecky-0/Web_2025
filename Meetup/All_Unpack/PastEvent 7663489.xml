Lisa originally organized but this sounds like SO much fun I thought I would share with our crazy crowd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watson Adventures is at it again! &lt;br /&gt;This time they're urging us to explore the hidden (and not so hidden) roots of our humble Hub. As those who attended the Salem Hunt can attest, this is no relaxing trivia game. You'll be sprinting around the city, gathering answers discovered along the way to questions that make up &amp;quot;the hunt&amp;quot;. This is the perfect opportunity for newcomers (and not so newcomers) to our city to get a feel of what's gone down over the past, oh, 300 or so years. Check out the description off their website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you know &amp;quot;Old Boston&amp;quot;--from the Boston Common to the North End--then prepare to be surprised. Discover the secrets of such historic places as Faneuil Hall, Paul Revere's house, the Old North Church (where the lantern code was &amp;quot;One if by land...&amp;quot;), Old City Hall, the Old South Meeting House (where a particularly large tea party had its beginnings), the Old State House, the aromatic food stands in Quincy Market, Italian bakeries, and much more. Starring Ben Franklin, Larry Bird, the Kennedys, Mother Goose, Gulliver's tea kettle, and an Irishman's &amp;quot;bowl of tears.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $20 and must be purchased prior to attending. They are available at: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ovationtix.com/trs/pe/350471" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.ovationti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign up as an individual, but list Meetup as the friends you'll be meeting. We'll break into teams once there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the scoop on Watson Adventures through their website at:&lt;a href="http://www.watsonadventures.com/schedule_boston.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.watsonadve...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(and stayed tuned in May for the &amp;quot;Munch around Cambridge&amp;quot; hunt...did someone say food?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hunt lasts from 2-4:30 and all that running is certain to work up an appetite. Definitely plan on dinner thereafter...the possibilities are endless! Details to follow and suggestions encouraged. So bring cash for food and def drinks after the fact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at 1:30 to meet, greet and lay down some team strategies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please snag your tickets prior to RSVP-ing yes. Am not sure about the sell-out potential for a daytime hunt, but there's no use signing up ticket-less as they won't let ya join the fun without one. &lt;br /&gt;If you want to join us just for dinner, send me an email and we'll make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, hunt down Terri (you can recognize me by my pic) or Lisa but again, details to follow once we sort out details.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I pretty much look like my pic but may have my hair in a ponytail....ALWAYS BIG dark sunglasses!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208865870000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><why>A great way to get to know Boston whether you are new to the area or lived here your entire life!</why><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207193380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Secrets of Old Boston Scavenger Hunt-Joint Event</name><id>7663489</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208626200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/7663489/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/c/2/global_3683058.jpeg</photo_url></item>
