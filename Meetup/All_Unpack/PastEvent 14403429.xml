<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 2 mile looping hike of higher difficulty for the first half to get the juices flowing. For the first half we'll hike up the steep grade of the Giant's head on the blue trail. then clifftop hiking to the backside of the head and back down again. We'll hike the Tower Trail (a.k.a. dirt road) to the tower and then return on the same dirt road for an easy conclusion to the hike.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot across from Quinnipiac University at 11 AM. There should be no fee to park (normally $8 for CT residents). The hike would start from the trailhead off of the parking lot.  We would finish at 1 PM at the latest and possibly head out to eat lunch if people feel inclined (Mexican place nearby or ice cream :-P yum). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate location/directions for parking lot meetup location&lt;/b&gt; off Mt.
