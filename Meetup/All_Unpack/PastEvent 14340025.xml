Often their eyes glaze over and their minds come to a screeching halt when God and love are spoken of together. God loves you in a personal and real way. God fashioned you to flourish and thrive through a relationship with God. This reality has been forgotten and as a result, people live in fear, sadness, attachment, and worry. The mark of real love and real peace is the absence of these things. Come and learn how to truly accept this love and have an experience of this peace that can springboard you into a new way of living and a new understanding of love.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282870022000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-684</urlname><id>1246909</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Meditation Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281108608000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  All You Need is Love</name><id>14340025</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282865400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-684/events/14340025/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/2/global_7927570.jpeg</photo_url></item>
