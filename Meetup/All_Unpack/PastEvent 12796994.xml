Most items are priced under $10.00, including full dinners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet to eat at 5:00 and then go to the theater across the parking lot at 5:50ish. The movie begins at 6:10. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shutter Island with Leonardo DiCaprio. Length: 138 Minutes Rating: R &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals &amp;quot;escape&amp;quot; in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Directions:From Falmouth/Mashpee:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Rt. 28 towards Hyannis.&lt;br /&gt;Turn left on Rt. 130 and travel approx. 7 miles.&lt;br /&gt;Heritage Park will be on your right side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Mid/Lower Cape:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Mid Cape Highway (Rt. 6) North&lt;br /&gt;Take exit 3 (Quaker Meetinghouse Rd.), turn left&lt;br /&gt;Quaker Meetinghouse ends at Rt. 130, turn right&lt;br /&gt;Heritage Park is approx. 1 mile down, on the right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Barbara will be waiting for you at the Mediterranean Grill...you can't miss me, it's tiny!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barbara </member_name><member_id>7313867</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268869562000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
