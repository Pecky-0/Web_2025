 Soldiers Saving Puppies - Puppies Saving Soldiers &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puppy rescue mission rescues the dogs and cats for our soldiers who have saved the animals from abuse and/or death while deployed in the war zones of Afghanistan. The simple act of saving and nurturing these animals builds a strong loving bond and provides our soldiers with a very important and positive morale booster. This unintentionally diminishes may of the mental and emotional effects of war while being stationed so far away from home and loved ones. This bond is so strong the soldiers fear what will happen to their furry friends when they return to the USA. It is our mission to raise funds and arrange travel to bring these important battle buddies home for their soldiers. &lt;br /&gt;
