It has good food and is reasonably priced, but its main draw is its unique garden atmosphere. &lt;br /&gt;Nestled in a little courtyard between houses and apartment buildings, this restaurant has outdoor seating in a beautiful and peaceful garden, shaded from the sun and insulated from the noise of the city.   &lt;br /&gt;The food is simple but good, middle eastern food with a Moroccan bent to it.  They have good vegetarian options as well as good desserts teas, coffees and especially home made Baklava.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://kasbahgarden.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://kasbahgarden.c...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening plans could change based upon the weather. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the dining group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacey</member_name><member_id>7637795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1280798911000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279228273000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Belly, Belly, Belly and BYOB</name><id>14114633</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280615400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/14114633/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
