We will call in our Angelic Guides and release all that no longer serves us, or hinders our life experience, replacing it with golden-white, healing Light. This will be a powerful group experience of healing, and it's free! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Free will donations gratefully accepted, not required) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hostess is Mia, co-founder of Labyrinth-Alchemy. Four Winds is a charming, warm, and high vibration private residence. The address will be sent about 24 hours in advance to those who have responded 'yes'. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mia</member_name><member_id>3507274</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sloane </member_name><member_id>4077054</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287228567000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Women Supporting Women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Women-Social-Network-Group</urlname><id>1379831</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Women Supporting Women Through Life's Incredible Journeys</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286222163000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Group Healing Ceremony </name><id>14998264</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286733600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Women-Social-Network-Group/events/14998264/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/9/global_7285529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
