<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I am continuing my Metacomet curiousity in Farmington.  All the times we went to the Heublin Tower to hike I wanted to know where the trail went across the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to park across from Reservoir #6.  There is parking on the side of the road.  You can of course use the reservior parking too.  We will meet there and organize folks to shuttle us to the starting point.  We will begin at the commuter lot at exit 39, Rt.84, route 4.  This time we will head north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 10:00 and we should be on the trail for 10:30 after the shuttling back to route 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a 6 mile hike north on the Metacomet.  Our view will be Kilkenny Rock which promises views after a brief climb.  We will finish at the Reservoir 6 parking area.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Please wear appropriate footwear (boots) and bring snacks or lunch and water.  I expect this hike to last not more than 4 hours depending on trail conditions and the group that attends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to the meeting site: &lt;br /&gt;Reservoir 6 is on Rt. 44 in West Hartford.  From Bishops Corner, travel north on Rt. 44.  You will see the sign reading Reservoir 6, Metropolitan District on your right. &lt;br /&gt;From Avon, at the junction of 44 and 10, take 44 south for 2.3 miles.  The lot will be on you left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This address is just short of where we will meet.  The Metacommet Trial will be just up the hill a bit.  We are meeting across from Reservoir 6. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=West+Hartford&amp;amp;state=ct&amp;amp;address=1+Old+Stone+Extension" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin the hike here at the communter lot on route 4:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Farmington&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=1+Prattling+Pond+Rd&amp;amp;zipcode=06032-1803&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.72467&amp;amp;longitude=-72.807529&amp;amp;geocode=ADDRESS" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please no dogs or children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
