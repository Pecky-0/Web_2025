<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;At this meeting we will focus on portrait photography using studio lighting. We will have three separate areas set up - two with strobe lights and one with hot lights. We will discuss the use of softboxes vs. umbrellas, and the use of different softbox sizes. Since there are different types of lighting involved, this will also be a good exercise to practice what you have learned about white balance from our last meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be enough models to provide at least one for each setup in the shoot. To cover expenses. I&amp;rsquo;m asking $25 from each photographer - this includes a copy of a release form from each model. You are also welcome to use this opportunity to bring your own model for her personal photoshoot for an additional $10.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you would like to use public transportation: The Blue-line Orient Heights Station is less than a mile away.
