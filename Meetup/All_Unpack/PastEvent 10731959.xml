Here is a description from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;For those of you who are fascinated with the Enneagram and the Myers-Briggs, one of the skills to develop is the ability to type people accurately. You can utilize the Personality Types information much more realistically when you can detect type. Learn all of Herb's verbal and non-verbal tips (and and face gestures, voice tone, speed of talking, body language, dress, etc.) on how to detect type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn the questions to ask that tend to clinch getting the type correctly. Herb has 19 years of experience typing thousands of people, so don't miss this rare opportunity to learn the secrets of typing! Herb will demonstrate the non-verbals of each type (it's fun to watch) and also help clarify for anyone attending, what type you are, as well as others in your life you are unclear about their type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a sliding scale from $20-40 but for Unique People it is $15-40. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00 it helps the presenter and those who might pay less. No one is turned away because of money, so pay what you can honestly afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcome to bring vegetarian appetizers and drinks, including wine.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** About Herb Pearce ******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce, M.Ed., has been teaching personality systems for 20 years and has been a psychotherapist for 30 years, having worked with thousands of individuals, couples and families, as well as teams in corporations and agencies.
