&lt;p&gt;7:15-7:45 Guest Speaker Presentation - Matt Williams, Technical Evangelist, &lt;a href="http://www.yottaa.com/"&gt;Yottaa&lt;/a&gt;, Inc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that customers are more likely to leave a slower page, but is there a correlation between the content and the types of content on a page and how that page performs? How about a correlation to Search Engine Optimization? These were the questions we wanted to find answers to here at Yottaa. In order to find out we measured 10's of thousands of sites and then analyzed the results. We looked at different styles of sites with a wide range of content types like javascript files, images, media, and social widgets. The results were interesting and at the same time a bit surprising. While it confirmed that more content can lead to lower performance, it also improved SEO rankings under some conditions. In this talk we will show you the data we collected, and talk about what we found: what works on web sites and what doesn't, how to get your customers to engage more with your site, how to understand why they go away, and how to ensure that they stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:45 - 8:15 Open Internet Marketing Round Table Discussion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts will share specific advice in an open discussion. We open up the discussion to possibly expand on other topics beyond the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:15 to 8:30 Open Challenge Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get advice to help fellow internet marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:30pm The End&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you all at this informal Boston search engine round table discussion!&lt;/p&gt;
