<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;After traveling overseas for some time, I am back in Boston and looking forward to great events throughout this summer!  We are the original Boston Nightlife meetup group that has produced hosted events for the past 3 years.  Come out and experience why we are one of the best meetup groups in Boston!  All members are welcome!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;**If the RSVP is full, please put yourself on the wait list, as I will be opening up more spots as the event date approaches**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage everyone to come out and celebrate our summer launch event, as it will be a great opportunity to meet new people and get your groove on!  &lt;b&gt;I expect a big turnout, so RSVPs will fill up quickly - don't miss it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hitting two spots on this particular Friday night:  Minibar and Saint.  Minibar is a new comer to the nightlife scene, and it is quickly establishing itself as one of the best lounges in Boston.  Saint requires no introduction, as it remains a Boston hot spot, and is one of my favorite venues.  Both are upscale and classy venues, and they are located close to each another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8:30pm at Minibar, which is located on the ground floor at the Copley Square Hotel (51 Huntington Ave).  &lt;b&gt;I encourage everyone to arrive early to have time to meet people, as venues will get louder and more crowded as the night progresses.&lt;/b&gt;  Please look for me to find the group.  We will head over to Saint (90 Exeter St) around 10pm to beat the lines.  Please meet us at Minibar, and try to get there early as to have time to meet people.  It will be tougher to find us once inside Saint.  Cover:  None for Minibar, but there will be a cover for Saint, which I expect to be $10-$20 per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site. &lt;b&gt;For help/questions, my cell: 646.541.0708.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please dress appropriately as these are upscale venues.&lt;/b&gt;  If traveling by T, Copley is the closest T stop on the green line, and Back Bay Station is the closest on the orange line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!
