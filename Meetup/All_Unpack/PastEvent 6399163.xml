Father Rassbach+ will be performing the Johannite Holy Liturgy for us and discussing anything we might like to talk about with him. So if you've never seen what a Christian Gnostic Eucharist service looks like, here's your chance! Membership in the AJC is not required for participation in or observation of the Holy Liturgy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP either Yes, No, or Maybe. It really helps us plan for our meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as always, please contact me with any question, comments or concerns!&lt;br /&gt;In Gnosis,&lt;br /&gt;Anthony &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
