This time we will do the Skyline trail in its entirety! The Reservation guide lists the entire trail at 9 miles and estimates the time at 4 to 7 hours....and it is full of elevation change and rocky terrain. Make sure you bring plenty of water, snacks, and lunch as well as hiking boots. We will meet at the Shea Rink parking lot on rt 37....this is exit 6 off of 93, which is the end of our hike. Once we have everyone there we will take the needed number of cars to get everyone to the starting point, which is a parking area on rt138 near the trailside museum. After the hike the people with cars at the end will give people rides back to their cars at the beginning. Really looking forward to this one, lets hope for good weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Jenn Brown and I are leading a series of hikes to prepare us for the Mt Washington hike on Memorial Day weekend. We are starting with some easier ones and working our way up to some more difficult terrain and elevation gains, so if you go on a bunch of these then you should be ready to tackle Washington with us in late May.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the bright yellow escape or call my cell 508 414 8544.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271804722000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268490298000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue Hills Complete Skyline Trail</name><id>12865842</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271597400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/12865842/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/9/global_13613561.jpeg</photo_url></item>
