I hope I've gotten everything right here; it's the first time I've scheduled a meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt; that these Open Studio events are NOT at our usual venue, the Button Box, but at a location in Holliston. The address and contact phone numbers will be sent to people who RSVP &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAY/TIME:&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, December 14, noon to 8 p.m. Come for an hour or two; come for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AGENDA&lt;/b&gt;: No scheduled activities. Arrive and leave when you want. Work on your own projects at your own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AMENITIES&lt;/b&gt;: Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST&lt;/b&gt;: $5, regardless of how long you stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND&lt;/b&gt;: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups who has already attended at least one regular Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT TO BRING&lt;/b&gt;: Your own materials and projects to work on (just as you do for the regular Meetup). A few basic supplies--scissors, glue, tape, etc. -- are available for loan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP&lt;/b&gt;: You must RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function so we know who's coming and how many to expect. If your plans change, switch your RSVP to no ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CANCELLATIONS&lt;/b&gt;: If you must cancel less than 24 hours in advance -- or after the Open Studio has started -- you should also call the Open Studio host. The host's phone number will be e-mailed to you after you RSVP, along with the Studio address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we need to cancel due to weather or for any other reason, we'll post a message here AND e-mail or call anyone who's RSVP'd as far in advance as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you can't make it this time, don't fret -- we'll be offering MANY more of these, especially after the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>701360</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230318707000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228784249000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ArtStudio 360 Open Studio Day</name><id>9304756</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229274000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/9304756/</event_url></item>
