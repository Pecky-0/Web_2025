The Wedeln Ski and Outdoors club offers an all season ski house for its members. We are a not for profit organization, organized for and run by our members. Our philosophy has always been about having fun and meeting new people!  we started as a ski club but we  now enjoy many outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current members reside in metro-Boston and enjoy events in the Boston area or weekends up North in the Mt. Washington area of NH. During the winter, we participate in snowboard races, ski races and social events with other groups in the area. During the summer, we hold organized weekends for paddlers, rock climbers, golfers, bikers, and hikers. Come check out our photos from past events as they tell our story best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join our meetup today to learn more about us, checkout our fun events and meet our awesome members. Please note, Wedeln is a physical house up in North Conway NH that sleeps 70+ people. Joining this meetup facilitates coming up as a guest to the house, information on social events, etc. It does not get you a "key" to the house. Should you be interested in more information on how to get a "key" or house membership, contact Tom for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't wait for ski season, check out our club this fall.  We have hikes, biking and many other activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
