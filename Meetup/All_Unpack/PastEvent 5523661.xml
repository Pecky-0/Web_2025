<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The first Friday of each month the Center of Light Boston sponsors a free Conscious Movie Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's movie will be St. John of the Cross. Along with being a religious figure, St. John of the Cross was a radical in his time calling for the reformation of his church doctrine to be in line with Jesus' teachings of peace and love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our times, we can all use good examples of non-violent, humble and active workers for peace. St. John of the Cross is one such example. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be held at 7:30 pm on Friday, March 2 at 97 Perkins Street, Jamaica Plain. I hope you will join me for popcorn and peaceful conversation. &lt;br /&gt;Feel free to contact me should you have any questions. &lt;br /&gt;Peace, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541076000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172704164000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Night</name><id>5523661</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172881800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/5523661/</event_url></item>
