Details here: &lt;a href="http://porcfest.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://porcfest.com...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have a presence there in conjunction with the Alternatives Expo (&lt;a href="http://AltExpo.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://AltExpo.org...&lt;/a&gt;) and will be showing 911 Truth and related videos almost non-stop for the last 3 or 4 days of PorcFest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the video schedule details, subject to revision until the time of the showings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://altexpo.org/videos" target="_blank"&gt;http://altexpo.org/vi...&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to stay overnight, The Alternatives Expo has plenty of camp sites available at $30/night or you can share a site with someone already there in the Boardwalk campsite area. Sometimes the evenings are the best part of the day with campfire conversations till all hours, so you really should stay over to enjoy PorcFest the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $5 donation listed for video viewing is optional, but due to costs, we would appreciate donations to pay for the tents, the video equipment, the food and beverages and for the campsites themselves. TANSTAAFL, you know!
