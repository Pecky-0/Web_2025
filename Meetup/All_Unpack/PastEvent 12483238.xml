When you don't have leaves to help you, let the form, height, habit, bark, context and other characteristics be your guides.  Enjoy a few hours out in the fresh air at Robinson Woods learning about the wonderful tree species in this &amp;quot;gem&amp;quot; of a location just a few miles from downtown Portland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will run about 2 to 2.5h depending on questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our guide, Shawn Clarke, is a utility and first class landscape arborist and has been working with our local trees for twenty years.  He has a passion for trees and plants and grew up just a couple of miles from Robinson Woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress in layers for the weather and feel free to bring notebook/camera.  Meet in the parking lot on Shore Road.  If there's heavy snow on the ground, feel free to bring snowshoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain/Snow date is March 14th all other details the same.  In the event of a date change we will post a note on this event page by 8am. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268147579000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265039352000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skillshare: Winter Tree Identification Walk with Arborist Shawn Clarke</name><id>12483238</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267974000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/12483238/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/3/global_12902787.jpeg</photo_url></item>
