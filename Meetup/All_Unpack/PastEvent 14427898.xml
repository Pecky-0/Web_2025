Hope more of you can come now! Please RSVP either way.**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn't know Camelot? Charming King Arthur marries beautiful Guenevere. They live in a perfect world where it only rains after dark. Then she cheats on him with his best friend. Hearts break. And we all get to hear beautiful ballads.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Meetup details:&lt;/span&gt; Tickets are $51 + outrageous handling fees (online purchase, Amazon payments) = &lt;b&gt;$57.50&lt;/b&gt;. I will buy our seats together. When you RSVP, please just pay online through Amazon payments. **We can get a group discount if 10 people sign up, and if so, I will refund the difference to you.** Don't wait -- there are still seats left, but I'm sure they will sell out. The deadline to RSVP is &lt;b&gt;5 pm, Tuesday, Sept. 7.&lt;/b&gt; If you miss the deadline, but still want to go, send me an email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 7:30 pm, and we will meet in the lobby of &lt;a href="http://www.trinityrep.com/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Trinity Repertory Theatre&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;b&gt;7 p.m.&lt;/b&gt; Parking downtown can be tricky, so please allow plenty of time so you're not late. (This is Trinity Rep speaking, not just me!) There is a paid garage next to Trinity with entrances on both Fountain and Washington Streets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the show, we will head around the corner to &lt;a href="http://www.trinitybrewhouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Trinity Brewhouse&lt;/a&gt; for dinner/drinks/apps.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in lobby at 7 pm - look for small red &amp; white Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286111379000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281885113000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Camelot - Trinity Rep</name><id>14427898</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286060400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/14427898/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/d/global_17194909.jpeg</photo_url></item>
