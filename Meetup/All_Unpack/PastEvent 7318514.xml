We present things we work&lt;br /&gt;on.  If someone has a question as to how we did something, we share&lt;br /&gt;that.  This particular meeting is coming on the heels of DrupalCon and I&lt;br /&gt;suspect lots of tips and techniques will be shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're interested in learning more about Drupal, please come by.  The&lt;br /&gt;group is most helpful.  I only started working with Drupal last&lt;br /&gt;November.  The people have been most generous with their knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>red jacket</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leah</member_name><member_id>2960740</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205445877000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>To download Drupal:
