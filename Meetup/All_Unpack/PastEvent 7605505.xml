Dress for the weather (gardening gloves are comfy), wear a helmet, and light up those blinkie bike lights!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group meets at the flagpole on the New Haven Green, which is across the street from City Hall. The ride leaves by 6p, but has been known to depart by 5:45p. Get there early and introduce yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you have any questions about the event. Eric: 860-214-9361. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ride usually ends at a house party (BYOB) or local pub; in the &amp;quot;off-season&amp;quot; rides generally terminate at a local drinking establishment. Bring some cash and a festive attitude! The ride itself is slow-paced, non-intimidating, safe, and fun. Obey traffic laws (ie; it's illegal to ride on the sidewalk) and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See: &lt;a href="http://www.elmcitycycling.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.elmcitycyc...&lt;/a&gt; for rider safety info.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>will be on a blue Fuji fixed gear, reflective-taped pants legs ;)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric</member_name><member_id>2576129</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206929420000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Biking is good for you!
