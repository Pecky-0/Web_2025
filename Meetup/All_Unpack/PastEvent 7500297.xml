Arn spent four years of his youth under the regime of the Khmer Rouge and was imprisoned in a labor camp where he executed others and played propaganda songs on his flute. If that's not bad enough, in 1979 the Khmer Rouge recruited Arn to fight against the Vietnamese when they invaded Cambodia. Luckily, Arn managed to flee to a Thai refugee camp and was later brought to New Hampshire by an American refugee worker when he was 16, yet his past still haunted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flute Player is a chronicle of how Arn is trying to bring back traditional music to Cambodia, a place where 90% of the master musicians were killed or starved to death during the Killing Fields and the Vietnamese occupation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This documentary was featured on the PBS documentary series POV in 2003 and is being screened in conjunction with the Boston Public Library's Making a Difference: Individuals Who Chose To Participate series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the film is only an hour long, we will probably all be heading for home by 8:30. The film is being shown in the Rabb Lecture Hall.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be standing at the front of the theater with a meetup sign after the film is over.
