By challenging the events of the gospels, Pullman puts forward his own compelling and plausible version of the life of Jesus, and in so doing, does what all great books do: makes the reader ask questions. In Pullman-s own words, -The story I tell comes out of the tension within the dual nature of Jesus Christ, but what I do with it is my responsibility alone. Parts of it read like a novel, parts like history, and parts like a fairy tale; I wanted it to be like that because it is, among other things, a story about how stories become stories.- Written with unstinting authority, The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is a pithy, erudite, subtle, and powerful book by a controversial and beloved author. It is a text to be read and reread, studied and unpacked, much like the Good Book itself. -------From Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Jesus-Scoundrel-Christ-ebook/dp/B003IGR19Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;qid=1272270832&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://thegoodmanjesusandthescoundrelchrist.co.uk/site/" target="_blank"&gt;The Books Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Boston Atheists Table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279408275000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272271075000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book &amp; Brew (The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, by Philip Pullma)</name><id>bmjmnynkbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279404000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/13291669/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
