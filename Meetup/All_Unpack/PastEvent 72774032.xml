&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives organized weekly Patriots viewing parties last year with guests from several other invited groups attending. We had a blast with up to 80 people attending at various locations in Boston, Woburn and Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Star will be our Primary Home for watching 2012 New England Patriots games (as well as hosting Trivingo).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will introduce you to The North Star with a RED SOX NATIVES EXCLUSIVE EVENT, a 2012 Patriots Season Kickoff Party on Friday, August 24 at 7:00pm to watch the Patriots take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the third Pre-Season Game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff and The North Star has kindly reserved a large section of the venue for the Red Sox Natives. Come early by 7:00pm to get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff will welcome you to The North Star with Cornhole to add to the Tailgate feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff at North Star will provide a spread of appetizers appropriate with the number of on-line Pre-Paid YES RSVPS. Pre-paid Event fee to reserve your space is $10.00.
