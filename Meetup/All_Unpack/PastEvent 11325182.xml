Many throughout the ages have achieved this through the Shamanic Journey.  A shamanic journey is a special state of trance consciousness that enables communication with the energy or spirit of the universe.  Through this practice you will discover and communicate with both animal and spirit guides.  In addition to these connections, you will be able to ask questions about yourself and your purpose, helping you to find guidance on your path.  The tools given to you during this workshop will enable you to continue this technique on your own and will assist you on your spiritual growth.  When attending this class, please bring a blanket, a pillow, an eye cover and a journal.  Optional book purchase is Animal Spirit Guides by Steven D.
