The presenter will demonstrate two easy techniques anyone can use to share and distribute work samples to blogs and sites like Facebook - 1) using Google's FeedBurner to syndicate content and - 2) using Gigya's Wildfire service to create a widget for viral marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also have time for networking and to enjoy some tasty beverages and ice cream. The event will be limited to 12 members.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254693886000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244595985000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sharing your Work - Viral Marketing on Social Networks</name><id>10617464</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248908400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/10617464/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
