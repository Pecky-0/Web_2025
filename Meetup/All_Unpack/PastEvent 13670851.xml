The bare summit provides 360-degree views across most of the White Mountains and, on a clear day, into Vermont and New York. The loop we will take over the summit is one of the easier ascents, however it will take us about 3 hours to reach the summit and there is one steep section near the top of the climb.  There are no sections of extreme exposure on this hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very popular hike on one of the busiest weekends of the season, so we do need to be at the trailhead by 9:00.  Parking is along the length of Ravine Road.  The later you get there, the longer you will have to walk to the trailhead!  It is not uncommon for cars to be parked a full mile up the road. A USFS Parking Day Pass MAY be required.  If so, one will be available at the trailhead for $3.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike may be combined with the Mount Hedgehog hike on July 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will have a Plan B (probably Mt. Tecumseh) in case of bad weather.  Since there are two hikes this weekend and many of us will need to book motels in advance, rain will NOT cancel hiking plans, but it may alter the routes we take.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What:&lt;/i&gt;  Mount Moosilauke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Distance:&lt;/i&gt; 7.5-miles loop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/i&gt; 2628'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difficulty:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pace:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate.

The goal will be to support hikers new to the White Mountains in achieving a 4000 foot summit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To participate you should:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable hiking UPHILL at about 1.5 miles per hour at a 15% incline for about 4 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable walking at least 8 miles on uneven terrain including roots, rocks, and granite ledges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have sturdy hiking boots.  No Sneakers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have rain and wind protection.  No Ponchos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be able to carry at least 2-3 liters of water. (3 strongly recommended.)  (Remember, 1 liter weighs 2 pounds!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be in good physical condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equipment List&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sturdy Hiking Boots.  &lt;b&gt;No Sneakers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rain / Wind Jacket. &lt;b&gt;No Ponchos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm fleece layer (100 or 200 weight fleece is fine for summer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something warm for the summit.  Expect it to be very windy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-3 liters Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headlamp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trail Snacks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lunch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bug Repellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optional Gear:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiking Poles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gaiters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen / Sunglasses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camera / Binoculars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Jeans, Sneakers, or Cotton clothing on the hike!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lodging Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several motels in the area that are reasonable this time of year.  This being July 4th Weekend, however, I strongly recommend booking a room now if you plan to stay up there for the weekend.  Three places that I stay are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EconoLodge in Lincoln, NH.  (603) 745-3661&lt;br /&gt;Mount Coolidge Motel in Lincoln, NH.  (603) 745-8052&lt;br /&gt;Red Roof Inn in Plymouth, NH.  (Note: it's 21 miles further south.)  (603) 536-2330 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dining Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakfast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stay in the Lincoln area, Pegs on Rte 3 (next to Woodstock Station) opens at 5:30 AM and serves a great breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stay in the Plymouth area, Annie's Overflow just off Exit 25 opens at 6:00 AM and is also excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch / Dinner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can go to either The Common Man in Lincoln, or Woodstock Station in North Woodstock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I-93 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Exit 32 in NH.  Turn RIGHT onto Route 112 West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 miles turn LEFT onto Route 118 South.  (Easy to miss! If you pass the Beaver Brook parking lot or the Lost River Valley Campground, you’ve gone too far!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 7.2 miles (winding uphill then starting down the other side), turn RIGHT onto Ravine Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drive all the way to the end of the road (stay to the right at the access road turn-off) and reverse direction in the turn-around. Drive back down and find a parking space on the right side of the road (the western downhill side, closest to the Lodge and Mount Moosilauke). Make sure there’s room for busses to pass. Do not park in the turn-around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total driving time from Providence, approximately 3.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Useful Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Ravine Lodge, we will take Gorge Brook Trail 3.7 miles to the summit of Mount Moosilauke.  We will gain 2461' in elevation.  There is one steep section near the summit.  From the summit, we will take the Carriage Road down to the Snapper Trail, gaining another 150' or so near the South Peak.  The Snapper Trail will bring us back to the junction with Gorge Brook, and from there we will return to Ravine Lodge and find our cars somewhere along the road.  Total distance is 7.5 miles and total elevation gain is 2628'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that a White Mountain Parking Pass MAY be required at the trailhead.  If so, you may pick a day pass up at the self-service station at the trailhead for $3.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gas Stations: I have found that the cheapest gas in the area is typically at either the Mobil Station or the Irving Station just off Exit 23 on I-93.  It's a good idea to fill-up there on your drive north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liability Waiver&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you for yourself, your heirs, executors, and administrators release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Grey Hyundai Sonata with RI License Plates.
