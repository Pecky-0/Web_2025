<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;SEAL member Bryce is asking for help moving a few things. From Bryce: "I moved into my new place at 20 Lafayette St, Rochester, NH on Sep 1st and 2nd, but I have a lot more stuff in a storage container at the Portsmouth U-haul. I will need some help unloading the container and carrying the stuff up to my 2nd floor bedroom. The biggest items are a digital piano and 2 filing cabinets (if anyone has a 2-wheel dolly it could really help with the filing cabinets, while the digital piano, lighter than an upright, just needs two strong people to lift), the rest is mostly boxes. I will do the standard pizza and beverage thing for moving-in parties. I also need someone with a tow-capable vehicle to come earlier to pick me up and drive me down to Portsmouth, and tow back the trailer I'll rent with my storage container on it, and return it to the U-haul after it is unloaded. I planned this for the 8th because I expect the whole day off from work, and I figured a weekend would be easier for a lot of people. By the way, if anyone can help me some time to pick up some furniture from a store that doesn't fit in my car (if I buy a bed, it will be 6 1/2 feet long - this part of my moving doesn't have to be on the 8th), that would also be much appreciated."&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Todd Puterbaugh</member_name><member_id>4083337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318092745000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317774581000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bryce's move-in party in Rochester</name><id>36176052</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318087800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/36176052/</event_url></item>
