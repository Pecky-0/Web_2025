And with Leo and Gemini overhead, it is a great time to brush up on your knowledge of all the spring constellations too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to attend a slide presentation by Jim J. Zebrowski at the Sutton Library at 6:30PM on April 14, 2010 and help jump start your spring viewing season. We will have night sky maps available for all who attend - families and beginners are especially welcome. The PowerPoint presentation will cover objects that you can easily view from your backyard and offers tips on observing the sky with the unaided eye and with the help of binoculars or a small telescope.  It will especially update everyone on amazing Saturn and will feature some grand views that the Cassini spacecraft has returned from orbiting Saturn and its icy moons! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you can attend this grand startup of our 2010 viewing season. I will also offer a schedule of upcoming events that will have you marking up your calendars for the upcoming observing season.  I'd like to see if we can get a really good turnout for this meeting so I can gage how often I should schedule our meetups throughout the upcoming season. Please send me your ideas about future programs and locations if you have them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would like to let everyone know that the Aldrich Astronomical Society, Inc is now on Facebook - please sign up for fabulous discussions about the world of astronomy. I am a moderator along with Margo Farnsworth from Aldrich - 2010 is shaping up to another amazing year in the world of space exploration and astronomy so step up and start looking up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Jim J.
