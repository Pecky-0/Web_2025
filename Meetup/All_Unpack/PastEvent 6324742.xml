Thank you to all those members who participated in last month's MSPCA walk for animals. It was a great success.   &lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting, I would like to try to continue to keep both meetups in two locations (just as we have for the summer). Members can choose to attend the Commons at 11AM and 1PM and we will also continue to hold meetups at 1PM at Doggie Day, Boston (Tremont Street). Let's try to continue to hold both for October and November meetups!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who would like to attend the park in the morning then move onto to Doggie day at 1pm are welcome to do so, but PLEASE as always make a note in the rsvp so that we can keep track of the numbers :)  &lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any further questions regarding this please also post them on the message board thread for the Sunday meetup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.
