I should have confirmed the reservation sooner I guess. My sincere apologies for the mixup. I've changed the reservation to Tony and Lucilles on Wooster Street at 7:30.  &lt;br /&gt;Please email me so I know everyone knows the new location or you can call me at 203-215-8070.  We seem to have nice crowd for this event and I hope everyone can still make it. Tony &amp;amp; Lucille's is also a very good Italian restaurant. They also have their own parking lot. Looking forward to meeting all of you. &lt;br /&gt;Cheers,  &lt;br /&gt;Kathy&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193701175000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191187714000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The New Haven Dining Out November Meetup</name><id>6458206</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193527800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/6458206/</event_url></item>
