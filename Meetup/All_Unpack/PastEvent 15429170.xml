It was renovated in 1995 and now has a very attractive look at the corner of Prince and Hanover Streets. Their lunch menu has many choices, all reasonably priced. Ranges are: Antipasti $7-13, Pasta &amp;amp; Specialties $12-16, Pizzette $11-13, Panini $9. We'll meet at their long bar from 12:00-1:00 for drinks and mingling, then sit down for lunch at about 1:00. To cover tax &amp;amp; tip, 25% will be added, and cash is the best form of payment, since we will not get separate checks. We'll be accepting RSVP's for this event on Friday Nov. 19th, Saturday Nov. 20th and until 11:00 AM on Sunday Nov. 21st.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further event guidelines. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the bar until 1:00.
