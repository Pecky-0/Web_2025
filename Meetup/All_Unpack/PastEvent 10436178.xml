Ave. intersection)&lt;br /&gt;*Thursdays from 8 PM - 11:30 PM (see note!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you're learning Japanese or English, buy a drink, join the table, and practice your new language in a friendly and relaxed environment. If you're a beginner or just interested in culture, you'll fit in fine! Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn and practice over a few drinks. Can't make it on time? Need to leave early? Not a problem. Just stop by if you can! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that due to the location, you must be at least 21 to enter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Thursday May 28th and June 4th I will be unable to host this event due to moving and then graduation preparations. If you would really like this event to take place and can volunteer to host it either night, please let me know. Otherwise the event will resume Thursday June 11th. Watch the website and the emails for updates.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Also, if you will be joining us, please use of public transportation. Not only is driving while intoxicated dangerous, but there may not be any parking available in the area. Mass. Ave. also has street cleaning starting at midnight. Best methods for public transportation are the green line subway to the Hynes stop and/or  bus #1 to the Beacon St. stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So join us! (I'll post a sign so you can find us)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Lindsay&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the sign!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lindsay Calder√≥n</member_name><member_id>6777251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243472086000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242649050000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Japanese Evening Table</name><id>10436178</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242950400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/10436178/</event_url></item>
