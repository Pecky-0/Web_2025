&lt;p&gt;I&amp;nbsp;have booked a trip on the Monroe Bridge section for the dam release Sunday, June 12, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-r has also posted this for his group.&amp;nbsp; If you are booked with him then you are all set.&amp;nbsp; Understand though that this trip will sell out so you need to book soon to get a spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price for this trip is $95.&amp;nbsp; This includes the trip and BBQ lunch after the trip.&amp;nbsp; Monroe Bridge is a super fun section.&amp;nbsp; The meeting time at Crab Apple is 9:30 a.m. but I always&amp;nbsp;get there a bit earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the link to the information for this trip specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to attend here are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Call Crab Apple 1-800-553-7238.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Tell them you want the Monroe trip June 12 and you are in Janice May's group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Pay the nice folks and then respond to this site and tell me you are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing to be scared of with this activity.&amp;nbsp; If it has ever crossed your mind to try this activity, go for it.&amp;nbsp; I will&amp;nbsp;post another trip in September but go for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to bring a change of clothes because you will get totally wet.&amp;nbsp; You will be paddling most of the trip. The link will tell you the age&amp;nbsp;range for those who can participate in you are considering children.&amp;nbsp; My preference is that you book seperately if you want your kids there. This has some strenuous aspects to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
