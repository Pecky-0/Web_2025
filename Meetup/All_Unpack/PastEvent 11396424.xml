We had great hikes last winter and early summer and need to get back into our &amp;quot;not too intense hiking&amp;quot;.  It was a fast summer, hopefully a safe and fun one for everyone.  Lets start with a favorite of mine,  Maudslay State park in Newburyport, MA, it's a great place to get the kinks out.  We can make it about a 2 hour hike.  Maybe lunch in Newburyport after if anyone is interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather forecast is looking good: Beautiful sunshine, but cool and fall-like. Highs in the mid 60s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link is: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/maud.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail map: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/maudslay.gif" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Parking Fee at Maudslay State Park is $2.00. Annual Passes are available for purchase.  That is the only charge, the park is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to bring your dog, there is a leash law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other rule is not criticizing the organizer.  Their role is only to put the event together.  The group is responsible for making it fun.  You go as far as you want and as fast/slow as you want as long as someone is with you and you have a map or knowledge of the park.  Hiker Code of Responsibilities is on our web page under files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From North and South: Take Rte. 95, exit 57 to Rte. 113 east. Follow 113 east for half a mile and turn left on Noble St. At stop sign turn left onto Ferry Rd., bear left at fork and follow signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From West: Take I-495 exit 55 to Rte. 110 east.
