The NPS trolley and Rangers take visitors to the birth places of John Adams &amp;amp; John Quincy Adams and the &amp;quot;Old House&amp;quot; mansion they and their descendants used as adults.  The total tour lasts 2 - 2.5 hours.  For those interested (and at additional cost) we can visit the nearby United First Parish Church to see the crypts containing the Presidents and their wives.  Afterwards the group will go to the Fowler House restaurant to have lunch and raise a toast to Tall Clubs' International founder, Kae Sumner Einfeldt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost:&lt;/b&gt;  The park tour is $5.00 + the cost of lunch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking:&lt;/b&gt;  Available on Hancock Street or in the Saville Ave. Garage behind the Galleria building (the NPS will validate tickets).  You can also take the Red Line to the Quincy Center stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;  Go to the &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/adam/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;park's website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP:&lt;/b&gt;  Please RSVP by May 1st so Craig can try to make an advance group reservation for the 11:00 AM tour.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marie A</member_name><member_id>4623326</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242169445000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240807951000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tour of Historic Quincy/Founder's Day Toast</name><id>10274541</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241361000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/10274541/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/b/global_3153499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
