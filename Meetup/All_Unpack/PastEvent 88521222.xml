Everything in the city was old and made of stone...It was hard to believe that, under this powerful carapace, the tender flesh of life survived and reproduced." --from &lt;em&gt;Chronicle in S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Set in the small town of Gjirokaster on the verge of World War II, &lt;em&gt;Chronicle in Stone&lt;/em&gt; is no ordinary war novel. In fact, there is nothing ordinary about it. Told from the point of view of an especially sensitive and impressionable young resident, it registers the static of war against the indifference of the town, an indifference that's almost equivalent to that of history. However, amid British bombing, foreign armies passing through, the action of local partisans, the boy undergoes another kind of turbulence, that of growing up, the inner and outer experience ringing strange harmonies. He responds to the beauty of unattainable women, to witchcraft, literature, and later, when he is evacuated from his "stone city" to peasant and village life. He expects his existence will be "marvelous, terrifying and extraordinary." Instead, it is anything but. Kadare conjures up the tumultuous and whirling scenes of war and even more so, the boy's loss of innocence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355788255000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351177943000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kadare: Chronicle in Stone</name><id>88521222</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353279600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/88521222/</event_url></item>
