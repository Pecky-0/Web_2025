Boston's only Mexican-Irish bar.  According to their website, they have 60oz Margaritas for sharing, other specialty Margaritas and Mexican food.  We'll just play down the Irish part because they had their fun on St. Patrick's day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there from 3:15pm (ish) to 7:30pm (ish), but feel free to come and go as you please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please maintain your own tab or pay as you go.  There will be no group tab because people will be arriving and leaving at different times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a good chance this place will be packed.  You've been warned!  :-)  Try to get there early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Jose McIntyre's website for more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.irishconnection.com/index.php?id=42" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.irishconne...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing friends and meeting new people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Just wanted to let everyone know ... A Mariachi Band and a DJ from WFNX will be there at 8pm.  There will be a mustache contest as well.  I doubt I'll stay till 8pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My cell phone # is 617-999-9094.  Call me if you don't recognize me from my picture.  I will wear my t-shirt that I got in Sedona AZ.  It has a cactus on the back, it's rust colored and on the front it states "Red Dirt, Sedona, AZ".</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>2969721</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>40</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211337279000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><why>To hang out for a bit after work.</why><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207145139000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cinco de Mayo - Margarita Monday!</name><id>7657188</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210015800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/7657188/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/8/global_1419608.jpeg</photo_url></item>
