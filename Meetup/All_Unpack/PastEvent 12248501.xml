The concert is also FREE, and first-come, first-seated.  The Landmarks orchestra is top notch, and it's well, FREE.  So, if you have no Friday night plans, come and join me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's program will feature Charles Ansbacher conducting an all Beethoven program, including the Eroica symphony and André–Michel Schub playing the Piano Concerto #3.  For more details about the concert, go to &lt;a href="http://www.landmarksorchestra.org/concertsnonsummer.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.landmarksorchestra.org/concertsnonsummer.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.landmarkso...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm, but try to get there at 7:15 before when the doors open at 7:30, so we can hopefully ensure the group has a chance to get good seats and we can socialize before the concert.  I've not been to this venue before, but I'm assuming that there's a lobby that we can stand in in January, so I'll be in the lobby with my meetup button and stickers, and hopefully can get someone to usher members to where we're sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;NOTE: I'm told these events fill up fast, so don't come late or you're likely not to get a seat!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Sanders Theatre:&lt;br /&gt;The theatre is located in Harvard Yard at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=sanders+theatre,+Harvard+University,+Cambridge+Ma&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=59.467068,135.263672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=sanders+theatre,&amp;amp;hnear=Aggasiz-Harvard+University,+Cambridge,+MA&amp;amp;ll=42.375888,-71.115232&amp;amp;spn=0.00688,0.016512&amp;amp;z=17" target="_blank"&gt;45 Quincy Street, at the corner of Cambridge Street&lt;/a&gt;, a few blocks northeast of the Harvard T stop on the Red Line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;ALSO:&lt;/span&gt; I've been told that there is free parking at the Harvard garage on Broadway (actually on Felton, but called the Broadway garage) for Sanders events. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's All Beethoven program will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Piano Concerto No. 3, Op. 37 in C minor         (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FetACZlj0_0" target="_blank"&gt;listen to the 1st movement here)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Symphony No. 3, Op. 55 in E-flat Major (Eroica)   (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFltqVS8d9I" target="_blank"&gt;listen to the 1st movement here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will try to grab some seats when the doors open.
