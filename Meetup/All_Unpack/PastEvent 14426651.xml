Let's also order pizza for the night.  We will provide drinks and snacks too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a nice collection of games, but you are welcome to bring any you would like to play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two cats and a dog in our house.  The cats will be kept in a bedroom, but our friendly dog is free to roam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is available anywhere on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; will get an e-mail that week with the specific address and directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286153655000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281869715000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Games &amp; Pizza in Haverhill</name><id>14426651</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284843600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/14426651/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/f/global_1947167.jpeg</photo_url></item>
