If you have any ideas for game you like to play let me know, otherwise I'll come armed with a few.   I am fan of games of tag where every on is &amp;quot;it,&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;who's line is it any way&amp;quot; variety of games.  I like singing improv games as well, but I am more then willing to follow your lead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will definitely be held on the forth floor of the porter exchange building-- hopefully in one of the Dance Studios.  I think room 414, but I will post it on the bulletin board near the security desk.  Feel free to call me, if you get lost or if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181950371000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181156849000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Improv and acting games</name><id>5861533</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181777400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/5861533/</event_url></item>
