&lt;p&gt;It's 3 hours long but I have a feeling that we'll want to talk about what we've seen.  So I will plan on going for a drink and a snack after.  Looking forward to sharing this experience with all the opera lovers in our group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composer Thomas Adès conducts the Metropolitan Opera premiere of his own work, with baritone Simon Keenlyside starring as Prospero. Director Robert Lepage recreates the interior of 18th-century La Scala in this inventive staging.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the ticket taker at 6:00 until 6:10, then will try to find seats.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354156944000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351170805000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Metropolitan Opera - The Tempest</name><id>88507122</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354145400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/88507122/</event_url></item>
