<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;My name is Sophia and I am the group organizer and I would like to invite everyone to the center of Light on Sunday at noon for an hour of introduction to meditation. I have been meditating daily for the past 2 years and have felt immense inner peace and joy and would like to share what I have learnt with everyone. Meditation is listening to the still small voice within and it takes practice and is often easier with a group. So come and join me and find your path to the peace within. &lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;Please e-mail or call 617-894-8866 if you plan on joining me. thanks&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540417000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1154438563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>group meditation</name><id>5054531</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1154880000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/5054531/</event_url></item>
