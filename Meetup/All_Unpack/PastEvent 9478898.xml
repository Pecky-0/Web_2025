There will be entertainment and dancing with Four on the Floor. We have rented the American Legion Hall in Burlington (right off of 128) from 7:30-11:30 PM with help of our good friend Brian. There is a $10.00 charge which should cover the expenses and some snacks. There will be a cash bar. You are welcome to invite family or friends. (adults only, don't have to be single). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pay online please indicate that &amp;quot;PAID&amp;quot; in your reply, it will help me keep track of numbers. I appreciate your help with this. The postponements and Mother Nature hasn't helped to get this organized. There is a limit of 125 people for the hall so please reply if you plan to attend. &lt;br /&gt;Come out and have a fun and casual night of dancing with a great band!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hall is ours for the evening, come on in!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235865312000</updated><rating><average>4.84000015259</average><count>19</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
