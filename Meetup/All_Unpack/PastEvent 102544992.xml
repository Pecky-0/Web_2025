&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If heading east on Route 101 get off at Exit 2 in Auburn and turn right at the end of the ramp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If heading west on Route 101 get off at Exit 2 in Auburn and turn left at the end of the ramp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proceed south on Hooksett Rd. for 0.8 miles passing Holidays Bar and Grill. Just after cresting the top of a hill and staring downhill again turn left onto Depot Rd. and proceed 0.2 miles passing 23 Depot Rd. Park at the first dirt parking lot on the left.  There will be a little pond in front of the parking lot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will hike two of the FOMBA mountain bike trails (the Fire Line Trail 3.0 miles and the Long Trail 2.1 miles) trying to avoid the winter snowmobile trails as much as possible.  Hopefully, the winter snowmobile trails we do use will be less traveled as they really don't go anywhere.  There will be places along the hike where one can turn back sooner if you don't end up wanting to finish the whole hike or want to do a shorter hike right from the beginning.  As the terrain is smaller hills any elevation gain isn't that significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any adult guest you want to bring should &lt;a style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;meetup&lt;/a&gt; site as a member so they will be covered by the liability waiver. A minor would need a written waiver signed by a parent or guardian&lt;/p&gt;
