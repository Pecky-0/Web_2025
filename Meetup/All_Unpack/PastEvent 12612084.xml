Many of us have been talking about it and many have searching and finding new and meaningful ways to use it. I think that every once in a while we need to know about the success of the others around us. Back in 2007 when we started the Positive Thinkers League at one of our meetings we had 65 people. I wonder what happened to many of them. When hearing something new we have many options; totally reject the topic, take what we like and leave the rest, give it a try and see if it works for us, digest it and use it, allow it to take hold and grow with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your stories, share how you have used the Law of Attraction to make changes in your life. If you have suggested readings or movies please share them with us. Sharing resources helps us all grow! Sometiems we are the teacher and sometimes we are the student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will go over a couple of processes during the evening that may enhance your dreams coming true even faster than you have imagined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open at 6:30.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for coming!!&lt;br /&gt;Barb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268866950000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266272689000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back to Basics- Step one of the Law of Attraction</name><id>12612084</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268694000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/12612084/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/4/global_9559044.jpeg</photo_url></item>
