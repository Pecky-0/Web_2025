North &amp;amp; South Baldface is a great hike and was my first Meetup (May 2008).  Our plan is follow the excellent route originally planned by Organizer Andy F.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt;: 9.8 miles (minimum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation gain&lt;/b&gt;: 3600 ft (minimum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Time&lt;/b&gt;: 6 hours and 45 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base plan is to hike the Baldface Circle Trail over North and South Baldface. This goes over some steep ledges up to South Baldface that can be dangerous when wet. If that is the case they can be bypassed by taking the Slippery Brook Trail to the Baldface Knob Trail. This would add 1.0 miles and 137 ft, which is an additional 35 minutes of book time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several opportunities for side trips that would extend the mileage and distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emerald Pool - 0.1 miles, 30 ft&lt;br /&gt;Chandler Gorge -  0.4 miles, 80 ft&lt;br /&gt;Baldface Knob - 0.6 miles, 100 ft&lt;br /&gt;Eagle Crag - 0.4 miles, 50 ft&lt;br /&gt;Bicknell Ridge and Eagle Cascade - 0.5 miles, 125 ft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is believed there is no snow currently on these trails. However please be sure to pack and dress for winter like conditions. Ice may be present so micro spikes are highly recommended.  There is lots of exposure on this trail so remember to dress for possible windy weather conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the NEHAAG disclaimer.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at trailhead parking which is 0.1 mi north of the driveway to the AMC?s
