Membership is just $25!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canoe rentals are $6/hour for members, guests pay only the non-member adult admission rate of $4. There are no kayaks and I don't think you are allowed to bring your own boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the parking lot of the Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary at 10:30. Please state in your rsvp wether or not you are a member of Mass Audubon. If the weather is good, bring a bathing suit and towel! We will canoe for 2 or 3 hours and then go for lunch at:&lt;br /&gt;Trattoria Ponte Vecchio &lt;br /&gt;435 Newbury St # 101, Danvers, MA (2.82 miles away) &lt;br /&gt;978-777-9188&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massaudubo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ipswich River, Mass Audubon?s largest sanctuary, offers more than 10 miles of interconnecting trails that invite you to explore the forests, meadows, and wetlands. Canoe along eight miles of the Ipswich River that run through the sanctuary and camp on Perkins Island, located a half-mile up the river (members can rent canoes from May through October). Members can also rent a cabin that is conveniently located close to the sanctuary?s office and program facilities and sleeps four. In April, listen for the chorus of American toads and pickerel frogs. Watch for river otters, painted turtles, and great blue herons at various times throughout the year. Climb the drumlin and esker, landscape features created by a glacier 15,000 years ago. Huge rocks and exotic trees and shrubs that were part of a former arboretum provide an adventurous walk along the Rockery Trail. This sanctuary has the following universally accessible facilities: Restrooms, Barn, Education Center. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Address:&lt;br /&gt;87 Perkins Row&lt;br /&gt;Topsfield, MA 01983&lt;br /&gt;978-887-9264&lt;br /&gt;ipswichriver@massaudubon.org &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;From Boston and the south: Take Rt I-95 north to exit 50 and follow Rt 1 north.
