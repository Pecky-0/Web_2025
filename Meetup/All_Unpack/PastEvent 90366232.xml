&lt;p&gt;my parents and I have decided to eat out for "turkey day" and I made reservations for 10 just in case there is anyone who would like to join us, for this seemingly fantastic spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to arrive at 1:15 on Thanksgiving, with reservations for 1:30, so I will limit this to ten for now, and maybe be able to add more to the reservation, if anyone signs up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I have me, my parents and brother and other possibles, but no definites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are having quite a spread of roast beef, turkey and ham with all the fixings, and I'm sure we can get separate bills.  The buffet is $23, see the attached flyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I don't see you then, hope to "meetup" soon and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you, and especially my organizers and Meetup attendees, for a wonderful year filled with lots of fun things to do, places to go and new people always to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Bless and a very Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours ;)  Hugs, Susan&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>ask for reservation for susan tisbert</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353623027000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley</urlname><id>1116818</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Meeting &amp; Greeting in So.
