<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the first scheduled meetup at MIT for Wednesday nights. I have initially scheduled it at the Saxon courts on Ames because the duPont courts on Amherst (near the bubble) require reservations. We can try this location initially, however, if someone wants to take the lead in organizing and reserving the courts on Amherst, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you attend, please let me know how it goes and whether you would like for me to continue scheduling these on a weekly basis. We can tweak the time depending on who attends regularly because I know that 6:30 PM works better for some people.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: Every Wednesday night at 6:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;Where: MIT, Saxon courts&lt;br /&gt;(At the intersection of Ames St and Memorial Dr)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>4498873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243086106000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242504627000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NEW: Wednesday nights at MIT</name><id>10426791</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242856800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/10426791/</event_url></item>
