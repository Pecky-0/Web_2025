This one sounded powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the MFA's discription:&lt;br /&gt;Hold Me Tight, Let Me Go by Kim Longinotto (109 min.). Both harrowing and heartwarming, Hold Me Tight, Let Me Go is a look into England’s Mulberry Bush School, founded by Barbara Dockar-Drysdale, who developed unique methods for working with children who have suffered severe emotional traumas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Michael Hayden, 2007 London Film Festival:&lt;br /&gt;Mulberry Bush is a boarding school in Oxford that caters for children who have been excluded from regular schools and who suffer from severe emotional trauma. The staff have to endure daily confrontations, a great deal of spitting and swearing from their charges, and valiantly attempt to change the violent and self-destructive patterns of behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;Kim Longinotto (The Day I Will Never Forget, Sisters in Law) draws some fascinating characters and stories from the chaos in the classrooms. With a perfected observational style she captures the humanity of the pupils, their families and the teachers superbly, and, though it is a revealing and moving study, the film is not completely without humour.&lt;br /&gt;As badly behaved as the kids are, it's to the film's credit that the viewer never loses empathy with them. Their relationships with their parents are very telling, while the teachers, skilled, dedicated and impossibly patient, appear positively heroic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we can go downstairs to the cafeteria for food and a discussion.  I suspect we will have a lot to say! Meet quickly down in front of the screen at the end of the film.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be down in front of the screen at athe end of the film.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3926531</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267491006000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hold Me Tight , Let Me Go</name><id>12750255</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269189900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12750255/</event_url></item>
