Thank you. &lt;br /&gt;Full Sturgeon Moon â€“ August The fishing tribes are given credit &lt;br /&gt;for the naming of this Moon, since sturgeon, a large fish of &lt;br /&gt;the Great Lakes and other major bodies of water, were most &lt;br /&gt;readily caught during this month. A few tribes knew it as the &lt;br /&gt;Full Red Moon because, as the Moon rises, it appears reddish &lt;br /&gt;through any sultry haze. It was also called the Green Corn Moon &lt;br /&gt;or Grain Moon.&lt;br /&gt;Place:  Hampton Beach, NH  behind the half shell outdoor stage.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Behind the half shell</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Angie D'Anjou</member_name><member_id>7038429</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Readings By JD</member_name><member_id>9397498</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282764488000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gifted</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Friends-in-Spirit</urlname><id>1373252</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Friends in Spirit</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282399503000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rising Full Moon Intention Gathering at the Beach  </name><id>14493013</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282690800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Friends-in-Spirit/events/14493013/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/4/global_7183796.jpeg</photo_url></item>
