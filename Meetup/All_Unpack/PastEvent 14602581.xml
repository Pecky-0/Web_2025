This is a lesson that we as human beings seem to have to learn over and over again. The Buddhist approach to lifeâ€™s suffering and to freedom from suffering can be applied to any spiritual path, as it contains an essential truth. If you suffer, you can learn to become free. Detachment from the world and attachment to Truth brings peace to the heart and mind. This seminar will explore the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism and how they can be applied to modern spiritual development. Join us for this seminar and learn how you can begin to ascend the mountain of your life toward true inner peace and freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the presenter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centersoflight.org/mother_clare.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mother Clare Watts&lt;/a&gt;  is a mystic; ordained priest; Master Teacher of Christian mysticism; and co-director of a mystical Christian Order, a school with 15 &lt;a href="http://www.centersoflight.org" target="_blank"&gt;Centers of Light&lt;/a&gt; in cities across the country.
