Hopefully the movie will be good, too!

The movie is at 6:55. I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com. I will be wearing my red meetup hat, and I will be in the theater lobby at 6:15. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables at the front of the lobby in front of the giant window. If the movie is downstairs, I will be just behind the ropes across from the concession stand.  I'll send some folks into the movie theater about 15 minutes before showtime to get us some seats. If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

When California girl Susan Murphy is unwittingly clobbered by a meteor full of outer space gunk on her wedding day, she mysteriously grows to 49-feet-11-inches tall. The military jumps into action and Susan is captured and secreted away to a covert government compound. There, she is renamed Ginormica and placed in confinement with a ragtag group of Monsters: the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.; the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link; the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B.; and the 350-foot grub called Insectosaurus. Their confinement is cut short, however, when a mysterious alien robot lands on Earth and begins storming the country. In a moment of desperation, the President is persuaded to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction.
