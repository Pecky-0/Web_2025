I have been having a hard time getting to the Wed and Thurs evening meetups because of when I have to sleep for working nights. To that end, I would like to start a Rochester meetup, Saturdays at 6 pm at Gary's, a sports bar. I will make it every 2 weeks like the others, to be held the same week as the Portsmouth meetup. I was thinking of doing it at noon but there's always something going on on Saturdays that might make it hard to be in town in the middle of the day. By starting at 6, people can get in and eat, and then have the option of sticking around while the band plays or whatever is going on there. We can play pool, or darts, there's a bingo room, and even a lot of big screen TVs with various sporting events.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329006602000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328401879000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New meetup in Rochester</name><id>51061552</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329001200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/51061552/</event_url></item>
