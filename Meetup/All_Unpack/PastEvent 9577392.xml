There are portable outhouses and trail maps on site.  No groomed trails but great conditions and has been skied over so some manmade tracks.  Thirty-five miles of trails to choose from.  NO RENTALS but you can rent gear at REI, EMS or Joe Jones.  They may not have water, so bring your own.  Some of the people going will have backcountry skis, some will have classic skis, skating is not recommended.  Snowshoeing will be excellent.  Please get there in time to start skiing at 10:00 AM, we plan on skiing to 2:00 PM.  We will see how to break up into groups based on who comes, but we will probably have two groups.  Bring food if you want to eat.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the park description and trailmap, I recommend you print the map and put it in a plastic bag just in case.   &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/harp.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;   If you have a trail compass you may want to bring it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a cell phone in case you need help on the trails.
