Grishaâ€™s almost-ridiculous technical wizardry and absolute command of the Flamenco genre have blown away audiences around the world. Jerome embodies the virtues of the great age of the Romantic guitar: effortless virtuosity and dramatic emotions. Grisha and Jerome will play both solos and duos."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw Jerome Mouffe in concert last year, and have developed a new appreciation for classical guitar as a result of his incredible musicianship. (Plus, the show where I saw him was a benefit concert for the Bhopal, India, chemical disaster--so big ups to the fact that he supports worthy causes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I've also crossposted this to the Boston Classical Meetup and at least one person's coming through there. Let's meet outside afterwards and find a nearby place to get a drink or something. Look for the tall Indian chick with glasses. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Smitha</member_name><member_id>1020284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351910161000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351611333000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grisha Goryachev and Jerome Mouffe - Flamenco and Classical Guitar</name><id>89178312</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351899000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/89178312/</event_url></item>
