He moved back to the United States, attended New England Conservatory and subsequently had a string of successes including performing internationally with some of today’s top flamenco, jazz and world music artists, collaborating with Boston-based composer Osvaldo Golijov on his Grammy-winning opera Ainadamar, performing in prominent Spanish nightclubs and even landing a small part in the recent movie Pink Panther 2 with Steve Martin!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearing in concert with Juanito Pascual will be Special Guest Nino de los Reyes one of Spain’s top flamenco dancers.  Also performing will be Boston’s Stan Strickland on flute, Gonzalo Grau on cajon, Rohan Gregory on violin, Jerry Leake on tabla and percussion and Seiki Tamura on guitar.  Several other performers will soon be announced.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition to composing and performing his own music, Pascual is passionate about education and social issues such as those held high by Culture Fest International and non-profit organization Second World.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gala concert will also serve as an introduction to the non-profit edutainment organization, Second World and its Culture Fest International (CFI) global ethical events.  A fair trade arts showcase will take place at 7:00 p.m. before the performance at Jordan Hall.  CFI’s event series foster sustainable international development while facilitating cultural exchange through music and the arts.
