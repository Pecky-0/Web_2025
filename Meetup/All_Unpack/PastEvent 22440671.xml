They will shuttle us up to Sumner Falls and we kayak back down which is about a 2 hour trip, but you can dawdle all you want. Harpoon is right next door if anyone wants to grab lunch, a tour, or just some drinks afterwards. It is $25 for the renting trip. If you have your own kayak but would like them to shuttle it up for you it costs $20. But maybe people with their own could carpool and work out something to save the money.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310340720000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308242390000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak the Connecticut River with lunch/drinks after at Harpoon</name><id>22440671</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310220000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/22440671/</event_url></item>
