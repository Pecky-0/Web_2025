<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;hi everyone, I'm not one to go out on New Year's Eve, and was just waiting for the forecast to see if the weather was going to hold out for this... Potluck and Bonfire (should be possible since it is going to rain Friday into Saturday, then clear up) I won't know until 5pm on the bonfire, but we can still do the potluck and party. Please bring an appetizer, or healthy munchy to share. Maybe some can bring sweets, but I'd rather the good stuff. I'm trying to watch my sugar and cholesterol...lol. lately I've been watching it go up...water and soda will be provided. Please park on my side of the street only. Bring an outdoor chair, and some slippers for inside, so my floors aren't a total disaster, when everyone leaves ;) BYOB and if you drink too much, I will be calling AAA, they are offering a free "tipsy tow" and ride to anyone who needs it, or I'll get you where you're going myself. If you don't come, but want to save the number here it is 1-800-222-4357. I don't have any plans on drinking, other than a champagne toast (I have one bottle, if anyone would like to bring another) Bring a sleeping bag, if you think it will be necessary ;) I have the whole family coming over for New Year's day, so I'm going to have to ask everyone to be out by 1-1:30am the latest. I'll need my rest...lol. Love to bring in the New Year with my very good friends, don't know if I'll make the dance on Friday, as it is supposed to snow, and I'm a real chicken in the snow. Plus I've got a full weekend. Hope you can make it! Hugs and a Happy, Healthy, Safe and Prosperous New Year to you all, susan&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll email my address/phone number to those of you who respond with a "yes" or "maybe"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325469088000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>fun folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dance-342</urlname><id>462174</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>Dance &amp; Activities Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325167732000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck and Bonfire on New Years Eve ;)</name><id>45828322</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325376000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dance-342/events/45828322/</event_url></item>
