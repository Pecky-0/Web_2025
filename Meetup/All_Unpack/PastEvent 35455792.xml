I'll be honest... showing off! Bass Pro Shops welcomes dogs of all breeds (provided they aren't aggressive, of course) and even give you a treat and a poop bag when you walk in! This would be just a casual, fun thing to do with the kids... Public thing to raise a little awareness and have some fun when it starts to get chilly!... Obviously, up to you all individually, but I ALWAYS buy at least a little something when I bring Spark here so they don't feel like we're intruding... Remember guys, just like all our events, NO flexi/extendable leashes and remember you are representing the NEBBC and our breeds. This is a public place: everyone needs to control their animals. Check out any of our tons of training events if you need help in this area or contact our in-house trainers, Cassie, president, at justcassie101@gmail.com, Barbara Jean Crehan, director of public relations at bjcrehan88@hotmail.com, or vice president Lorena Lacasse at newenglandbullybreedclub.com. Hope to see you there!! P.S. There are some pictures of our last trip on www.facebook.com/NEBBC!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321192319000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317306942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bring the Dogs for an Outing to Bass Pro Shops in Foxboro!</name><id>35455792</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321120800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/35455792/</event_url></item>
