Prime 16!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/53snrq" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/53...&lt;/a&gt; - Play article) (&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/4wtryj" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/4w...&lt;/a&gt; - Yale Daily News)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free Apps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6pm-7pm: 3-5 half price beers; half price wine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be an awesome happy hour.  This place hasn't been open long but I've already been there probably ten times (no lie....); what can I say? I'm a woman in love.  Within five minutes of going there for the first time, I knew that we had to have a happy hour there.  The manager there, Char (lovely woman), is excited to finally meet the group I've been telling her all about. Let's come out and support one of New Haven's newest places!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 beers on draft (selection changes often); 40 bottled beers. (Surprisingly well chosen group of scotch/whiskey as well; wine by the glass was yummy too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The burgers AND the vegetarian-friendly options have completely won me over. (Yes, I put aside my mainly carnivore instincts and had their veggies too.  YUM)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a quote from the Play article on the food:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret, Farber explains, is in the beef itself. &amp;quot;We get our meat from a company out of the midwest called Meyer Beef, the cattle are vegetarian fed... it's all natural, Angus beef.&amp;quot; Farber says what Meyer Beef is all about: &amp;quot;It's 250 family farms that raise it just for this company, so it's traceable, it's sustainable. There's no hormones at all, so water content is really low. The burgers are stamped, they're humanely slaughtered, and approved by the ASPCA- it says it right on the package.&amp;quot;....For those who prefer their burgers meatless, Farber- who was a vegetarian for quite a while- also offers a world-class veggie burger. &amp;quot;I make them myself,&amp;quot; he grins. &amp;quot;I add a little lemon zest, and grind I some sprouts into the other mixture, which is sweet potato, your standard mirepoix of vegetable, and some chickpea and some other whole-wheat ingredients and mix it together.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have a three-cheese grilled cheese with avocado and sprouts that sounds delicious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your contact for the event: Devorah 203-314-4329&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.
