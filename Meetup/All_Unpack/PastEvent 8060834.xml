We are limiting the number of folks who can attend. We do this so each person will have the chance to have their work critiqued...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring only two images. This way everyone gets a chance to have work critiqued by everyone else. Anyone bringing more than two prints will be flogged. It's just not fair to the others. (You know who you are... )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to bring a snack or a drink to share with the others....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The critique will end at 10 pm sharp, this is a thursday night and we all need to work in the morning! I guess that makes me the crazy time keeper lady... the last crits - there were a lot of wonderful work and lots of great comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions, comments - please let us know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214141808000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212418864000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Critique Night!</name><id>8060834</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213916400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/8060834/</event_url></item>
