This used to be the old House of Blues.  Check out their website for more info:  &lt;a href="http://www.tommydoyles.com/blog/harvard-square/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tommydoyle...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll wear a red shirt and I'm asking everyone to wear something red, so it'll make it easier to find us.  Just look for the crowd of people in red.  It doesn't have to be a red shirt ... It can be a red tie, red purse, red shoes ... Ya know ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's more than one floor, so depending on how many people show up, we may go upstairs or into the basement.  Just look around for the crowd of people wearing something red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll get there around 6pm (ish) and stay for a couple of hours.  Come and go as you please.  There will be no reservation, and no group tab, so please maintain your own tab, or pay as you order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appetizers are half-price until 7pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's live acoustic music starting at 9:30pm.  Check it out:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://music.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music.showDetails&amp;amp;friendid=78283669&amp;amp;Band_Show_ID=38552918" target="_blank"&gt;http://music.myspace....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I'll stay for the music.  We'll see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear a red top.
