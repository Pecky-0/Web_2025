Join us as we practice meditation and mindfulness, and hang around later to interact with like-minded people over a relaxing cup of tea. These sessions are being offered by the Art of Living Foundation, a non-profit organization engaged in service initiatives across 153 countries. So, come, empty your minds, and fill up your teacups! &lt;br /&gt;

***This week, in addition to our regular meditation, we'll have a special introduction to Sudarshan Kriya, an incredible breathing technique that takes you into a deep state of meditation and relaxation. Sudarshan Kriya is the highlight of a series of yoga and meditation techniques that are taught in the YesPlus workshops offered by the Art of Living Foundation.*** &lt;br /&gt;

No meditation experience required, all are welcome. Please RSVP!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359601269000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359392035000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meditation &amp; Introduction to the potent "Sudharshan Kriya Yoga" </name><id>101786792</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359590400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/101786792/</event_url></item>
