<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is an all day event - come when you can - leave when you want. I'll stay up all night if I'm having fun (and usually do), just call to find out if we're still going strong. Ben 617-997-3545.  I'll turn my phone off when I go to bed so feel free to call even if it's 4 or 5am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a snack, drink or game.  I have a whole host of delivery menus if anyone wants to order, but there may not be a group dinner time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seating for 12 at a time, but room for more around the tables if you want to bring a chair. Give me a call if you want to know how full the place is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live right on the B line. Walking distance from the C and D. Easy parking on Comm. Ave. during the day, not so much at night, but I can help you find parking if you call. Resident only parking on my street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you need directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: These events are quite variable.  The first one had a lot of food but fewer games; people arrived and left throughout the day (21 people peak of 13).  The second had a ton of games and less snacks; people arrived throughout the day, but left mostly at the end of the day (13 people peak of 12).  I provide some food and more games, but I like the randomness of leaving things up to chance.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Warmus</member_name><member_id>5401423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245888275000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244137995000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another come any time event</name><id>10576266</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245517200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/10576266/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
