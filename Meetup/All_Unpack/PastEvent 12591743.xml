I've reached out to the people at NERD to book another space, so hopefully we'll have our first 'Mini-Topic' meetup very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime,  I suggest another 'Pub Night'. As an added incentive, we'll have a special guest: Dave Klein (author of &amp;quot;Grails: A Quick-Start Guide&amp;quot;) is in town, and there's been some interest in meeting up with him. &lt;br /&gt;As for venue, I propose we meet at the Thirsty Scholar in Central Square.  If anyone has any strong objections, please let me know and we can reschedule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it'll be a good time; come join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll try and bring a sign, but take a look at some of the photos of us up here on the site.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Pember</member_name><member_id>9587085</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Chisholm</member_name><member_id>9594734</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266626418000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Grails-Boston</urlname><id>1458975</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Boston Grails Users' Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266014944000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Informal Pub Night </name><id>12591743</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266453000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Grails-Boston/events/12591743/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/global_9810037.jpeg</photo_url></item>
