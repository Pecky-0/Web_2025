Working with Town Historian Richard Betts and the Belmont Historical Society she has gathered oral histories and images that help to illuminate this remarkable story.  In her talk she will present highlights from her research, including a close look at the day-to-day challenges of governing a town of farms when greenhouses and orchards covered the landscape and market wagons carried Belmont's bounty to Quincy Market.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This talk will be in the Assembly Room of the Belmont Public Library.  The Library has a small parking lot and there is plenty of street parking.  It's only a couple of miles from Harvard Square and you can take either the 74 or 75 bus (get off at the stop after Belmont High School).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talk starts promptly at 7:00pm.  Show up early so we can find seats as a group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing my Meetup Logo button</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253228093000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252674682000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"When Belmont was a Town of Farms"</name><id>11346282</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253054700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11346282/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/global_5310283.jpeg</photo_url></item>
