I am not available to host either Meetup this weekend so if someone could please volunteer to look after things, that would be great.  Just send me a note if you're around to be an &amp;quot;interim-host&amp;quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither the Men's team or the Women's team have meets this weekend at Tufts, but they may be practicing at some point on Saturday so it's a bit of a crap-shoot but you should be able to get some good hitting time in before having to leave the courts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Hitting and I hope to be around next weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Kenger&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;Somerville Tennis Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;4/23 Update:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to &lt;a href="http://tennis.meetup.com/240/messages/boards/thread/8988519"&gt;the reply in this post&lt;/a&gt; on our Meetup message board, the main Tufts courts will not be available on Saturday. (Thanks for the heads-up Tommy and Huong!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could play instead at Dugger Park (five courts), which is less than two miles from the Tufts courts.  For directions, you can create a Google Map from your house (or from the Tufts courts; see address above) to Dugger Park, Medford, MA 02155.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be at the Dugger Park courts at 8:30am for anyone who wants to give at a try.  (At that time I don't think we'll have much competition for the courts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave&lt;br /&gt;Interim-Host-Type Guy&lt;br /&gt;Somerville Tennis Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask, are you with meetup?</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave M.</member_name><member_id>7526742</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272291336000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271948595000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Morning Tennis at Dugger Park</name><id>13258442</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272112200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/13258442/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/3/2/global_8966354.jpeg</photo_url></item>
