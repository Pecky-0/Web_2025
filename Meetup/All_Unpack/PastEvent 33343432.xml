You don't have to be a great frisbee thrower..just come and try it. It's wimp for a reason. We will meet at Hillside general store. I will offer some of my discs and the store has free loaners. They also have a nice sandwich counter if anyone wants to eat when were done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring sunscreen and bug spray along with wearing long pants and good shoes. We will be walking on wooded trails and yes, your disc will end up in the trees and bushes at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come on out and join in or just walk and have some fun company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call if you need more info 603-315-0275&lt;/p&gt;
