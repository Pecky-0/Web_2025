&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;their values etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s been almost two hundred years since the original foundation was laid for the main house at Stonyfield Farm. We don’t know anything about those hardy folks who first settled the land, but we can be sure that as they cut and hauled trees, lugged rocks for stone walls, cleared pastures, built the barn, milked the cows, plowed the fields, and thought their thoughts, they could never have dreamed that someday their farm would be the site of a thriving yogurt business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time: 10:30AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost: FREE (after the discussion we will get samples of yogurt)&lt;/p&gt;
