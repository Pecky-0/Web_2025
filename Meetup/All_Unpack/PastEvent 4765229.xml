<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the kickoff meeting for the Boston Plone users group. You will get to meet other Plone users in the Boston area, and hopefully learn something new about Plone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nate will have just returned from the Plone Conference in Vienna, and will give a post-conf summary of all the cool new happenings in the Plonosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's time, he can also do a recap of the Plone 2.1 talk given at the last Python users group meeting, and demonstrate all the new features of Plone 2.1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have specific topics that you'd like to discuss, please post them in the discussion forum. (and yes, we will eventually move this over to a Plone site).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the Green Line to Boylston T stop or the Orange or Red line to Downtown Crossing T stop. The Nature Conservancy is located behind Macy's at the corner of Chauncey. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1126742613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone October Meetup</name><id>4765229</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1130454000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/4765229/</event_url></item>
