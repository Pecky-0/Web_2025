<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will continue with On the Genealogy of Morals. Since we decided to break it into two, I suggest the first two parts for the next meeting and the last third part for the meeting after. (The first two parts are from pp.437 until pp. 533 in Walter Kauffman's translation: &amp;quot;Basic Writings of Nietzsche&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to try to meet twice a month the first and the third Thursdays of each month. (The meeting after the next will be on Dec. 21.) Please let me know if it is particularly bad for you if you can come to one of the meetings and suggest alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on December 7th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.:&lt;br /&gt;Note that this time we will plan to meet in the Bombay Club.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165709293000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163647683000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nietzsche: On the Genealogy of Morals I</name><id>5271143</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165536000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5271143/</event_url></item>
