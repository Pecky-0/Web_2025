Taking as our assumption that dreams are symbolic and can be interpreted, in this session of the dream meetup we will try to cultivate a state of consciousness in which the meanings of dream symbols can emerge more easily.  We’ll practice free associating on dream images and learn how to tune into those meanings that are most relevant to the dream’s message.  Over time the goal is to develop a personal glossary of dream symbols so that we can create a better, more open relationship with our dreaming self.  Please bring some dreams to share, especially dreams that are fresh in your mind and that you haven't worked too much with yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September's meeting will be led by Kevin Johnson, who is both a member of the Boston Dreamers and a long-time student of dreams and metaphysics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, September 8, 2009 &lt;br /&gt;7 pm - 9:00 pm (Two hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payment is a sliding scale - $10-$20. Anyone who cannot afford to pay should contact the group organizer Deerheart, to arrange alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Space is limited to 20 people. RSVP requested. Please update your RSVP if you are unable to attend, to allow others to attend. Thank you. Blessings, Deerheart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions by car: Very limited parking at chapel, otherwise nearby streets such as Broadway and Mass Ave. There is a free small parking lot on Kirkland Street side of chapel, up to 8 cars. Coming from either direction on Massachusetts Ave into Harvard Square, turn onto Cambridge Street, then onto Quincy Street and around the corner onto the parking lot on Kirkland Street. The chapel is right on the corner of Quincy Street and Kirkland Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions by T: The Cambridge Swedenborg Chapel is a lovely Gothic-revival stone chapel located at 50 Quincy Street in Cambridge, Mass. Please note that the official and historical name as may be found on maps and church directories is The Cambridge Society of the Church of the New Jerusalem (Swedenborgian). We are located at the corner of Quincy and Kirkland Streets, across from Harvard's monumental Memorial Hall/Sander's Theatre, which is behind Harvard Yard in Harvard Square. Access is an easy 5 minute walk from the Harvard Station MBTA stop on the Red Line and buses - just walk through Harvard Yard and ask anyone for Memorial Hall if you don't readily see the large fancy tower, then walk around the Hall to the chapel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information and directions for the Cambridge Swedenborg Chapel, check out their website &lt;a href="http://www.swedenborgchapel.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.swedenborg...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carl Schroeder</member_name><member_id>1741395</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deerheart</member_name><member_id>7399016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255478490000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Dreamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonDreamers</urlname><id>1339734</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Dreamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251735638000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Understanding the Symbols in your Dreams</name><id>11247002</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252450800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonDreamers/events/11247002/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/0/global_6668176.jpeg</photo_url></item>
