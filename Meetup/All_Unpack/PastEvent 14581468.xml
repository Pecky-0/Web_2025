We  will welcome home 381 returning troops, from their latest overseas tour of duty. Flights land here for an hour or so to refuel and change crews. Before they tack off again to return to their homes and bases throughout our country. Most of the the troops landing in NH. are not from New England. This will be their the first time they have set foot in the USA.. Most of the troops feel they are not sure until they land in the USA. If they are coming home in a seat or a box. When Steve O. returned from his oversea tours. He was welcome home the first time. The second and third time he was given the cold treatment and no one was there at all. So, now that we have learned to support our troops, and not to blame them for a  bad war.  Steve O. would like your help in giving these brave men and women a warm welcome home.&lt;br /&gt;    Please sign up online for the Pease Greeters emails. They will let you know where and when the flights are ariving. They will also let you know if the flights are late or early. Most of the flights are usually on weekday nights or early morning. So, Steve O. has been reluctant to ask people to join him to welcome past flights. But, this is a weekday and not too late or too early. So, join us. Steve O. has attended this event before, and found it more than worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;    More info. below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Directions from Boston:&lt;br /&gt;    Take Interstate 95 North into New Hampshire, continuing through the Hampton Toll Booth towards Portsmouth.
