This is a half marathon with non-stop rolling hills. They have a 2 person relay too. This race has a great local feel and good eats afterwards. Please comment if you need a ride or can give a ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.applefesthalfmarathon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.applefesth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets plan to meet at 9.15 am inside the main gym in the school. From memory last year this was open to everyone and a good meeting place. THERE IS NO PARKING AT THE SCHOOL and several different parking lots with free buses that take you to the school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care...  Martin (who took this over from Tree!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. You are responsible for your own registration, safety etc. etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll probably be wearing a blue Nike swoosh running tanktop.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254149658000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243261141000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Organised Public Event...
