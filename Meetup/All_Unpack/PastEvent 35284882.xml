Go home with &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; treasures to get your kids playing and reading again. Please bring only gently used toys, children's books, games, movies, video games, etc., with no broken parts. We will also have everyone share ideas of which toys, videos, movies, games and crafts their kids have loved at different ages, so start thinking. We can all get some ideas for holiday gift-giving! If you have questions, please contact Mindy Tracy at mindywhit@hotmail. com. We will try to donate any unclaimed toys or books to local shelters, charities, etc.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318466962000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317207362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MNO: Children's Toy and Book Swap</name><id>35284882</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318462200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/35284882/</event_url></item>
