<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Tomorrow evening, members of Boston Poetry are invited to join the workshop for another Discussion at Nine Devotion Street. The format will be as in the past two-part, firstly a conversation (this episode, the use of scientific fact in poetry) followed by a peer critique of members' writing. If you would like to have some recent work reviewed, please either e-mail it to me so I can have it reproduced or bring sufficient copies for perhaps 10 people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The venue, an apartment, can be I hope easily by starting in Coolidge Corner. Walking down Harvard Street and then taking a right will bring you to Babcock Street. Devotion Street will be the first left off of Babcock, and No. 9, the last building on the road before it dead-ends at the park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The workshop will commence at 7:00 PM. Food and drink will be provided.  If before then you have any questions, I can be reached at 617-358-2892, on AIM at &amp;quot;NullaDissolvant&amp;quot;, or at zakbos@bu.edu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zachary Bos&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273539877000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1125509417000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tomorrow's Discussion at Nine Devotion</name><id>4757006</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1125615600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/4757006/</event_url></item>
