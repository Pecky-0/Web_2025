Please schedule some time this month to attend at least one canvassing event. The sooner we get done in Nashua, the sooner we can move on and spread the word to another town.  If you do not know how to canvass, don't worry, we'll show you everything you need to know.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in the Parking lot in the area near the intersection of Spit brook rd and DW Highway.  We'll do a brief sign wave until everyone gets there. Then we'll hand out packets, do a brief tutorial, and then head out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193069162000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191844431000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canvassing in Nashua</name><id>6510167</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192896000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6510167/</event_url></item>
