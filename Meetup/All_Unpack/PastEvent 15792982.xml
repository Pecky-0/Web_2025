Pay from $1 to full price, or by paying more you can take this opportunity to &amp;quot;Pay it Forward&amp;quot; for others in need of an inspirational meal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of your meal, your server will generate your check as normal and then inquire as to how much you would like to pay. Please remember to tip your servers based on the full menu price or else please take it 'to go'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Excludes: Baked Goods, Bottled Beverages, Alcohol &amp;amp; Retail Items.&lt;br /&gt;** Limit of one Juice/Smoothie per day per customer.&lt;br /&gt;*** Limit $15 per customer per day; $25 per customer per weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our normal menu prices are already the best deal in organic &amp;amp; raw cuisine and there is no pressure for you to pay more or less than the standard price. We hope to see you this weekend whether or not you choose to be part of our 'crazy experiment'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider this weekend to be one of the early seedlings of a new paradigm for business enterprise, 'Pay-It-Forward Commerce'. You get the opportunity to be on either side of the equation (or right in the middle); as it is good to receive and it is good to give. Thanks for making our last Pay-it-forward Weekend a success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Garden Cafe is located at 294 Cabot St., Beverly, MA 01915 - 978/922-0004 &lt;a href="http://www.organicgardencafe.com" target="_blank"&gt;organicgardencafe.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please ask staff to be seated with The Boston Rawfood Meetup Group and/or contact other members via messages to meet and/or carpool.
