We hike at a pace 50% slower than the AMC Trailguide book time. Hike ratings:easy,moderate,strenuous,very strenuous.We start as a group,we hike as a group and we end as a group.There are three other hiking Meetup groups if you want a faster pace or more challenging hikes (The New England Hiking Meetup, 4 Seasons Hiking Group, New England Over 40 Hiking Group). The hiking Meetup group,(Fellowship of the Tortoise)does easier,slower paced hikes than this group. Our goal is to stay fit while enjoying the camaraderie of hikers who have similar skills and goals.If you click on the PAGES button on the home page,there is a Winter Hiking Gear List.  This is a dog free hiking group.Everybody must join the group and have a picture to be on a hike.If you are camera shy,print out a picture of yourself and give it to me at the trailhead.The picture is to show Fish and Game if you get separated from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trailhead: Take I93 north to exit 25, make right onto Holderness Rd (NH175A), make right onto Fieldhouse Road and park at the intersection (Plymouth State University). We will meet here and drive the back roads to the trailhead together (Warren St., Texas Hill Rd., trailhead on Old Hebron Road right off the intersection of Texas Hill Road).  We will hike the Fauver and Sutherland Trails to the summit of Plymouth Mountain (2193').  Good views from rocky knobs and cliffs. 4.8 miles round trip, 1,400' feet elevation gain, AMC booktime 3.5 hours, 5 hours estimated time for our group. ---Steve ----&lt;/p&gt;
