&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurants and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Trattoria Zooma on Federal Hill. Go down Atwells and it's a pinkish building on your right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://trattoriazooma.com/index.html"&gt;http://trattoriazooma.com/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trattoria Zooma is a trendy, upscale restaurant in the Federal Hill area known for it's southern Italian (Neapolitan) inspired cuisine and cosmopolitan atmosphere. They make many of their own pastas which you can see being made when you enter the restaurant in their &lt;span&gt;‘pastificio’.&lt;/span&gt; The menu is diverse AND they have half plates of most of their dishes, so you can try out a nibble or share a few plates with friends! If its warm out, they'll open the windows which is lovely! So, let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a bright blue, gradated-dyed scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
