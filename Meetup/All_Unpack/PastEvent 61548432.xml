&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another meetup to get us practice in running with friends outside of an actual race.  It's meant to make running a fun social event, instead of just that day's exercise.  When running becomes fun, you'll be more inclined to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of an out-and-back route from the boathouse at Riverside Park in Hartford south along a trail to the bridge, walk up the stairs, and run across the bridge to the East Hartford side, and then back.  It looks like that would only be about 2K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in Riverside Park.  Let's meet there outside the big boathouse at the river's edge.  Get directions here:  &lt;a href="http://www.riverfront.org/contact/directions/#Riverside"&gt;http://www.riverfront.org/contact/directions/#Riverside&lt;/a&gt; Please note that I don't have an address for this for your GPS.  DO NOT USE THE COLUMBUS AVENUE ADDRESS -- THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER LOCATION.  Follow the directions from the link above.  Call Chris at 860-204-2509 if you get lost or something.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet at the riverside next to the big boathouse, near the boat launch.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3979797</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338820109000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>5K-Runners-Meetup</urlname><id>1354697</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>5K Runners Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335036411000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Run together across the Connecticut River in Hartford!</name><id>61548432</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336833000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/5K-Runners-Meetup/events/61548432/</event_url></item>
