FYI, you can get tickets at a small discount through &lt;a href="http://www.goldstar.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goldstar.c...&lt;/a&gt;, it is half-price but then you pay a $2.50 service charge so it's $7.50 instead of $10. Goldstar is free to join and it gives you discounts on events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks like a cool blend of history, cute animals, crafts, and food! Gore Place presents its annual Sheepshearing Festival. This popular tradition features a wide range of activities â€” demonstrations of traditional farming and crafting (including sheepshearing and herding dogs), lively music, Morris dancers, performers, historic recreators, farm animals, wagon rides and a large crafts fair. New this year, guests can visit the Scottish Village, with kilt making, weaving, Scottish lore and a bagpipe band. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anna</member_name><member_id>404606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>29</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272296573000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268954637000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sheepshearing/Crafts Festival at Historic Gore Place in Waltham</name><id>12927673</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272117600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12927673/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/4/0/global_13742368.jpeg</photo_url></item>
