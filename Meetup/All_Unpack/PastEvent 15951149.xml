The location has been provided by our own meetup member Anne Francis, co-owner of the day camp.  If you don't recognize the name, you would definitely recognize her black Pug, Popo, with his little white feet, usually dyed purple.  By the way, the adjacent store at the Village Groomer and Pet Supply carries a marvelous supply of natural foods and great toys and accessories. We are thrilled to be able to continue our meetups right through the winter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the hall is being provided free of charge, I will be bringing the soft drinks and paperware, but I am counting on our other members to bring the snacks. Feel free to bring snacks for the Pugs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOST A MEETUP?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let your organizer know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be scheduling the meetups for the 2010 calendar in advance so that you can plan your Puggies' social calendar! Please note that most of the Sunday meetups are scheduled to take place at at Assistant Organizer Sharon's home in Carver - where Buford, Millie, and Max hang out - and most of the Saturday Meetups are scheduled to take place at your Organizer Charlotte's home in Brockton - where Clovis and Cletus live. However, we are always delighted to change the venue when someone else wants to host a meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're hoping that the folks who have hosted before will be able will step in and host a social or two in 2011. For those who haven't hosted before, but would like to try, and if you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 30 to 60 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host! It's fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your babies. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. If he starts bullying or being too rough with another dog, give him a time out until he can get himself under control. We want everyone to have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $72.00 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Cletus's faces when the Puggie meetups roll around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>annie</member_name><member_id>7498817</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299194043000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294359629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston February Pug Sunday Meetup</name><id>15951149</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298228400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/15951149/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/c/global_12380956.jpeg</photo_url></item>
