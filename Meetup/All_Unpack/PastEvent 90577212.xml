Holiday strolls and parades are a great opportunity to do outreach to big crowds. Only 15% of the U.S. population knows about Agenda 21. Come help educate people about the diabolical Agenda 21 that in NH, comes in the form of Granite State Future and Plan NH. The parade starts at 1pm. Letâ€™s meet at Salem Park and Ride which is located off Pelham Road in Salem just east of I-93 Exit 2 at 10 Raymond Avenue. I will have materials to hand out, but please bring your own if you wish to help out. Thanks!!! &lt;br /&gt;
