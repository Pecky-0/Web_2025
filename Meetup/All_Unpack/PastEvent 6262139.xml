If it's warm enough you might want to bring a bathing suit as we will be right next to the beach.  Also, I would recommend car pooling since it's approximately an hour and 40 min. drive from Boston.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cliff Walk along the eastern shore of Newport, RI is world famous as a public access walk that combines the natural beauty of the Newport shore line with the architectural history of Newport's gilded age. Wildflowers, birds, geology ... all add to this delightful Walk.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      In 1975 the Walk was designated as a National Recreation Trail ... the 65th in the nation and first in New England. The Walk runs 3.5 miles and about two-thirds of the walk is in easy walking condition. What makes Cliff Walk unique is that it is a National Recreation Trail in a National Historic District.
