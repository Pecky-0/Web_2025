I put noon as a good time to head up stream..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: The spelling and grammer arrors are made to protect the innocent, any reference to the word or sequence of letters are random...This message will self destruct in 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189439429000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Connecticut Arts - Theatre Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Theatre-Group</urlname><id>326612</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>Connecticut Theatre Group Arts-Theater Events Group Discount</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188654874000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>UPDATE: Picknick/kayak event at Tarriffville Gourge..Then Concert in Hartford</name><id>6279703</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189266300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CT-Theatre-Group/events/6279703/</event_url></item>
