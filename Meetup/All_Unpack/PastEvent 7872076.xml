We'll meet in the parking lot and take the Manning Trail to Firescrew Mountain named for the twirling flames spiraling off the summit during the great fire that denuded the summit by a devastating forest fire in 1855. Now grown to a well matured forest of 5655 acres, Cardigan State Park, with its 7 mountains, boasts 50 miles of hiking, snowshoeing, and back country skiing trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bald summits of Firescrew Mountain (3064') and Mount Cardigan (3155') afford 360 degree wondrous views for lightly moderate effort to see Mt. Monadnock, Mt. Washington, Lake Winnipesaukee, the White Mountains, Camel's Hump in Vermont, and Pleasant Mountain in Maine. There is a working fire tower open to the public on Mt Cardigan which is manned by a park ranger who loves to show you around and answer questions. We'll be hiking on the Manning, Mowglis, Clark, &amp;amp; Woodland Trails in a nice loop back to the A.M.C.'s 4 story newly renovated grand Cardigan Lodge to rest &amp;amp; relax. The round trip is just 5.6 miles, 1950' of elevation gain, in a book time 4 hours 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By popular demand, those that wish to add another hour and a mere 300' more, we'll visit the beautiful Welton Falls only 1.2 miles from the lodge. 60' below is a flume of precipitous ledges covered in thick, green moss &amp;amp; ferns with a channel that the Fowler River rushes down into a swirling pool 40' long and 20' wide. A small cave has a clear view of the river sweeping around the base of the high knob accelerating though a series of chutes and cascades to its dramatic plunge to the pool below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information: &lt;a href="http://www.outdoors.org/publications/outdoors/2005/mountcardigan.cfm?RenderForPrint=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.outdoors.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/lodges/cardigan/cardigan-directions.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.outdoors.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will stop at that great Irish Pub, , after the hike.&lt;a href="http://www.cunamaragroup.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cu Na Mara, 11 Hobart St., Rte 3A, Bristol, NH 03222&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213911930000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209942195000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Firescrew Mtn, Mount Cardigan, &amp; Welton Falls</name><id>7872076</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213537500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/7872076/</event_url></item>
