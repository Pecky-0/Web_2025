From their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beer Garden serves up great food and great times. From Wings to Burgers and Fries to Pasta and Hearty Fare there's something for everyone on our menu. Our laid back, relaxed atmosphere is the perfect place to kick back after work with friends or stop in before a game. Year round we have special promotions and giveaways, often featuring sports tickets or other great prizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have lots of TVs to watch any games, great food, good times, and it's close by - what's not to love?  Make sure to RSVP!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>6283119</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209855851000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Do we really need to give you a reason at this point?
