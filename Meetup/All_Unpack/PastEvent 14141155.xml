Rain will postpone this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the visitors station inside the park at 11 am, hike around the quarry and then meet back at the visitors center for a potluck picnic lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;When you RSVP for this event, please post what you will be contributing to the potluck picnic&lt;/span&gt; (if you are bringing a lunchable please bring enough for everyone)  For those of you who do not know what the lunchable reference is please ask one of last years attendees to tell you the story of the lunchable...it is quite funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has not been to Halibut before, to get to the visitors center from the parking lot, cross the street and follow the trail, the visitors center is a short walk into the woods. The visitors center will allow us to stow our picnic in the office while we are hiking or if you prefer to leave your picnic in the car the parking lot is just a short walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is a very easy trail, which in the fall is a beautiful walk.  If you are unable to go on the hike and would like to join the potluck picnic, please add this to your RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you all at Halibut State Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; Janet&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In front of the visitors center</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286894175000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>A-Circle-of-Friends</urlname><id>1421257</id><group_lat>42.8100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8799972534</group_lon><name>A Circle of Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279501129000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2nd Annual Halibut State Park Hike and Potluck picnic</name><id>14141155</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286809200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/A-Circle-of-Friends/events/14141155/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/1/global_16530833.jpeg</photo_url></item>
