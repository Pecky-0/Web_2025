I would love to see all come if possible.    Bring snacks or drinks if you would like.    As my house is still under construction...grrrrrrrrrrrrr..lol.. but they have a similar set up.    So there is a large room that leads into a fenced-in yard.     You will get a chance to meet some new people, some new pugs and  maybe Marie will bring her dremal and we can do nails.... Let's have a good time...... hope to see you there.. please rsvp to give us an idea of home many to expect... pug hugs to all of you.... I have missed you all..
