Looks like a great flyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Restaraunt is here... Can be pricey.  Unless we opt elsewhere....    &lt;a href="http://www.sp-oyster.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sp-oyster....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.navmonster.com/map/KFIT-KGON-10" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.navmonster...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; S&amp;amp;P Oyster is a restaurant in the heart of downtown Mystic, just at the eastern side of the bridge, that serves excellent seafood in a cheerful, casual setting.  Seating is available indoors and out, and is adjacent to the water taxi that will take you to Mystic Seaport.  Service was excellent on a mid-September Sunday, but expect crowds during the peak summer season.  You will need to take a taxi or ask the FBO to drop you downtown, which is only about 4 miles from the airport.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250716708000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250169107000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night ...
