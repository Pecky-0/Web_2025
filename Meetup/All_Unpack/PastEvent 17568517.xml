Finally, we can end the afternoon having &amp;nbsp;cocktails on the outside patio at Legal's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;For those of you already signed up for &lt;strong&gt;Sinatra Sunday at Lucky's&lt;/strong&gt;, we will head over for dinner and show before 7p. &amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;If you've already made your rsvp for Lucky's and you'd like to spend the afternoon with this group too, let me know so you can bypass paying the rsvp fee twice.)&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 3:30p we will walk down the gang plank to the "MBTA Water Taxi". This ride is $1.70 each way, free with a Charlie Card Link Pass.   MBTA Water taxi leaves every 30 minutes , so if you miss the  3:30p; take the next taxi and ride back to Long Wharf with the group on the 5:15p.  The  MBTA Water Taxi Route F4 leaves from Long Wharf to Charles Town Navy Yard (short 10 minute ride) After we will arrive on the dock we walk [i]10 minutes[/i] to the Navy Yard Pier and go through a security screening to enter the Navy yard. This could take time depending on crowds/wait times. You must have a valid ID. Note: You do not have go to through security screening to go visit the USS Constitution Museum which is also FREE.  This may only be a museum visit as there could be long lines to board the USS Constitution.  Make plans to get there earlier if you'd like to make the tour. &amp;nbsp; We will board the taxi at 5:15p and arrive at  Long Wharf at 5:25p or when you're done, simply meet us at Legal's.&lt;/p&gt;
