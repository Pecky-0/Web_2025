&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;These programs are VERY popular - while some randomites have been able to attend, many have tried to register only to find out that there were no spaces available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Signing up here DOES NOT register you for this program - you need to register read the description below and make sure you follow the instructions carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;=====&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Women can learn the skills for enjoying exciting winter outdoor activities at the New Hampshire Winter Becoming an Outdoors-Woman (BOW) workshop set for Saturday, February 16, 2013, (snow date Sunday, February 17), at the Owl Brook Hunter Education Center in Holderness, N.H. The program costs $55, which includes a box lunch.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Participants must be at least 18 years old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;This one-day workshop allows participants to spend the day exploring a single topic. You can learn how to ice-fish; gain winter outdoor survival skills; experience basic snowshoeing and tracking; try snowmobiling (beginners only); or challenge yourself to 'Shoe and Shoot (snowshoeing and woodland target shooting).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Registration will open on January 7, 2013. A brochure describing the workshop (not the actual registration form) is available now at &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://www.nhbow.com"&gt;http://www.nhbow.com&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested, sign up as soon as you can after registration opens, because BOW workshops often fill up fast!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;New Hampshire B.O.W. programs are co-sponsored by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department and the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;ICE FISHING FUN: Experience the excitement of ice-fishing, one of N.H.'s most popular winter activities. Come prepared to spend the day on the ice - drilling holes and dropping lines - as you learn about techniques, equipment, safety, and fish handling. There will be a variety of ice fishing shelters for you to try out and warm up in. You will enjoy our famous fish fry and hot chocolate, too!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;BASIC SNOWSHOEING AND WINTER TRACKING: This beginner course will introduce you to different types of snowshoes, how to choose the right snowshoes for your needs, how to put them on and how to maneuver in the woods. You will also learn what items to bring on a winter hike. Then, strap on your snowshoes and get ready to explore! You will be searching for signs of wildlife and learning the art of wildlife tracking. Snowshoes will be provided, unless you bring your own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;WINTER SURVIVAL: Shake away your fears of being outdoors in the winter! You will learn how to dress properly, stay warm, navigate and use basic survival techniques. The afternoon will be spent outside building survival shelters, rescue fires, and navigating through the woods. In addition, learn basic winter first aid techniques.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;SHOE AND SHOOT: Are you ready to try the exciting sport of snowshoe biathlon? This course combines snowshoeing and target shooting. You will begin your day with a quick review of snowshoeing techniques and then head over to the center’s shooting range. Safety and techniques for rifle shooting will be taught for the beginner. No firearm experience is necessary. A non-competitive course will be set up for teams to snowshoe their way to targets. A .22 caliber firearm will be provided. Prerequisite: basic snowshoeing experience is required and participants must provide their own snowshoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;SNOWMOBILING SKILLS AND SAFETY: Snowmobiling is one of the fastest growing winter sports. This course will show you how to be safe, stay warm, and have fun! You will learn basic snowmobile handling during a long ride. Participants will receive an OHRV Safety Certificate. This class is for beginners only; no repeat attendees please. If there is no snow, this course may be cancelled and participants will be given the opportunity to join another class. A snowmobile will be provided. We recommend you bring your own DOT-approved, properly fitting snowmobile helmet, if you have one; please check the appropriate box on the registration form if you need one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;NOTE: Equipment for all courses will be provided by the instructors, unless stated otherwise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
