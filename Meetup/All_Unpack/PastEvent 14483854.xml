If you'd like to come down to be recruited into some kind of editorial work, please send me an email. Otherwise, swing by to say hello, and to discuss any recent writing of yours. This may well be an all-day situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-organizers Nora and Zachary will be working throughout the day. Anyone who drops by will be met with a chance for conversation, refreshments, and discussion of their writing, at least among the three of us -- and depending on who else is there when you arrive, there may be more! This is notably different from our usual, more formal workshop format. If we were in fin-de-siecle Vienna, we'd spend all day at some marble-table-top cafe drinking kaffe and waiting for our literary companions to drop by and indulge or lambast our latest drafts. Panera may not be as nice a space, but we shall make do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns? Call Z at 617-935-4951.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282492910000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282310487000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Workshop and Journal Work: An All-Day Affair</name><id>14483854</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282488300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/14483854/</event_url></item>
