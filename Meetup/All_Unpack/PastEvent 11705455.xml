<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 3.75 hr. loop hike of lower to moderate difficulty near the south-central shore area in this 1,200 acre sanctuary with 39 miles of very interesting trails. &lt;b&gt;We are going to explore southern portions of the Reserve I haven't seen yet so this is an exploratory hike.&lt;/b&gt; We may encounter and involve traversal of modest cliffs, going through rockfall caves, small climbs, and seeing interesting rock formations, water views (Lost Lake), and sights! I'll be exploring for hike routes to offer into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trails have a unique blaze system (&lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org/reading_trailblazes.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.westwoodst...&lt;/a&gt; ). North-south trails are marked with a circle shaped blaze. Square or triangular trails weave back and forth connecting circle trails. Crossover trails that connect two circle trails of different colors are marked with an X of the color of the circle they lead to. Complicated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a good chance of some mud on the trail given the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go should have: &lt;br /&gt;* A daypack - To carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail food and water. &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots (sneakers not advised!) &lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water&lt;br /&gt;* Pants you don't mind possibly getting dirty from crawling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 1 PM at the parking area (&lt;b&gt;this one is different from the one we usually use!&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;Parking may be limited so RSVP's are limited.&lt;/b&gt; We would finish up at about 4:45 PM (sunset) and have some dinner out if the group feels like socializing more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;General directions&lt;/b&gt; (from a trail source):&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 57 off I-95&lt;br /&gt;* Take Route 1 north for about 1.3 miles.&lt;br /&gt;* Turn right onto River St.&lt;br /&gt;* When road ends, turn right onto Rt. 146 (Water St.) and go about a mile.&lt;br /&gt;* Turn right onto Sam Hill Rd., just before the railroad bridge.&lt;br /&gt;* Parking area at Entrance 3 is immediately on left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aproximate location/directions&lt;/b&gt; (Roughly at 3 Sam Hill Rd., Guilford, CT):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Guilford&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=3+Sam+Hill+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Westwoods interactive trail map&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org/inter_map.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.westwoodst...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Westwoods Reserve&lt;/b&gt; website (with trail maps):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.westwoodst...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Printed maps available:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org/map_availability.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.westwoodst...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map is in &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;Connecticut Walk Book: East&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; 19th ed., by Connecticut forest and Park Association as map &lt;b&gt;WW-1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail map available&lt;/b&gt; in &amp;quot;Connecticut Walk Book: East&amp;quot; 19th ed., Map WW-1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guilford Land Trust&lt;/b&gt; (maintains Westwoods):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guilfordlandtrust.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.guilfordla...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
