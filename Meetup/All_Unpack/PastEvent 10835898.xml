If someone wants your yarn for that amount they'll pay you or perhaps you'll trade for some yarn they have.  It's all of our first time with this so we're winging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knitting Origins:&lt;br /&gt;The oldest artifact with a knitted appearance is a type of sock. It is believed that socks and stockings were the first pieces produced using techniques similar to knitting. These socks were worked in Nålebinding, a technique of making fabric by creating multiple knots or loops with a single needle and thread. Many of these existing clothing items employed nålebinding techniques; some of them look very similar to true knitting. For example, 3rd-5th century CE Romano-Egyptian toe-socks. Several pieces, done in now obscure techniques, have been mistaken for knitting or crocheting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258889085000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247107079000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Unwound SWAP- Thursday Nov 19th</name><id>10835898</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258673400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835898/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/9/global_9564697.jpeg</photo_url></item>
