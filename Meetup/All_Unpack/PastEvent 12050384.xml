How do they make the most of each day and reach their potential? How do they 'take their foot off the brake'? Why do some people acheive their goals while others seem to continue to struggle? Are you interested in learning and collaborating on new methods of positive thinking? Or perhaps you're looking to surround yourself with people who are motivated, determined, and focused on achieving and exceeding, both personally and professionally?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mission of 'Successful Anonymous' is to bring together like-minded people, who share a desire to reach their full potential. The group environment will promote networking, relationship-building, discussions, open forum, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S.A. is focused on growth and development, so if you have any feedback, questions, or concerns, do not hesitate to contact us via MeetUp or via e-mail at VandDPartnership@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Find us on the 2nd Floor of the Library! </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>VandD Partnership</member_name><member_id>10820762</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262909500000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Success Addicts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>successfulanonymous</urlname><id>1551084</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Successful Anonymous</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260340559000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Successful Anonymous: Networking &amp; Discussions - 2010 Kickoff </name><id>12050384</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262736000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/successfulanonymous/events/12050384/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/c/global_11630172.jpeg</photo_url></item>
