The workshop  will include a small mead tasting of a few brews Jim has done, a talk about  the lore and value of mead, and a demonstration of how to make your  first batch of mead. Registration for the class is $30, and includes a  copy of his ebook book The Lore and Craft of Mead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Jim will have brewing kits available, that include all the  equipment and basic ingredients you will need to produce your first  batch of mead, including a 3-gallon glass carboy, rubber stopper,  airlock, funnel, siphon hose, and  a hydrometer, as well as a gallon of  fantastic local (to Jim in Maine) honey and a packet  of yeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are any questions, or specific requests for what the class  should cover, please contact Jim at BardicBrews.net! I&amp;rsquo;m very excited and looking forward to  Jim sharing the magic of mead with all of us! Space is limited, so  register now!&lt;/p&gt;
