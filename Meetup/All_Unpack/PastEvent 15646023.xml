Please plan to arrive by 5::30 the latest, so we'll be ready for Santa, due to arrive by 6pm.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Santa will read &amp;quot;the night before Christmas and give out candy canes&amp;quot;.  Please sneak an item, no more than $15 in cost, in the box/bag to the left of the garage, when you are coming in.  Have the Child's first name and last initial on the tag, that Santa can easily read...his eyes aren't as good as they use to be, his elves have been doing some of the sleigh driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is $5, and my address and phone number will be sent out to those of you with a &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; response the evening before.  In your response, please indicate how many children, names and ages.  &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; responses will not be counted in the final count, 24 hours before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The money is all going directly to Santa, to help with building presents for children in need.  If you would like to bring a healthy snack, something small...please feel free.  I will  supply some Holiday Cheer for the parents and juice boxes for the children.  Space is limited, so sign up early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas to all!&lt;br /&gt;Susan and Santa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292771813000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
