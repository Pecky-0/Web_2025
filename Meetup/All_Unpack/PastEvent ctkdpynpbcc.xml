Amida’s grace can be shocking and scandalous but it is always transformative, healing hearts and giving hope and a new beginning to those it touches. What does one do to get a hold of unhindered grace? How do we express it in our daily lives? This talk will use short stories and parable to illustrate grace from the Shin Buddhist point of view. It will be a perfect primer for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. Presented by Senpai. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From November to the first week of January, registration will be open for our most popular course, Buddhism 101 that explores the life of the historical Buddha and disciples, his teachings, the Eightfold Path, mindfulness and prayer, Zen and the Shin path.  Visit our main web site for more details and sign up information. Open to beginners to intermediate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See our CALENDAR @&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bffct.net" target="_blank"&gt;www.bffct.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;REMINDER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; -  Hosted by the Buddhist Faith Fellowship.
