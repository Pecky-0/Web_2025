You are a great person Larry and we are so very lucky to have you in our Cribbage Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen returned which is great, Debbie is new and said she would return (I don't think I beat her too badly)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Captain Bette and Emad, such great tans and I thought I was the tanned one  :(  Look at the photos to see tanned.  Thank you ever so much Gabe, what a fun group and photos to prove it  :)     I am trying to upload the one of all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan was a great trooper throughout the evening as was Teresa and Laura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember we meet at a restaurant and bringing your own food/water is not nice at all.  Also they do wait on us and do bring us our food, so how about a nice tip for them.  There is a cup at the register to put in a tip, which they really do deserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to see y'all in October, thanks for being such a great group of friends as well as G*R*E*A*T cribbage players...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the back room with our cribbage boards out !</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Micki E</member_name><member_id>4468648</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256077733000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cribbage Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WalthamCribbage</urlname><id>378600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Waltham Cribbage!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253816692000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waltham Cribbage Meet-Up  - Are we ready for the Dark and Cold   :(</name><id>11457426</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254866400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WalthamCribbage/events/11457426/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/3/7/global_10878823.jpeg</photo_url></item>
