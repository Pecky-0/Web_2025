<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be the third meeting of the Freedom Is Fundamental Book Club.  The meeting will be loosely related to Chapter 6 of &lt;u&gt;The Revolution A Manifesto&lt;/u&gt; by Ron Paul.  We will continue our discussion concerning inflation and central banks.  And expanding the discussion to include the central banks involvement with governments and global events. (sounds kind of boring, but it is fascinating - lots of intrigue and interesting facts that they simply don't teach you in school).  Special attention will be paid to the USS Lusitania and USS Liberty.   A short clip from the film the Money Masters will be viewed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is FREE&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served.&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a friend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUESTIONS: Please call Rachael at 401-222-0659 Do NOT CALL the Library. They are sick of screening calls about this. :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a name tag</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachael McIntosh</member_name><member_id>5611356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218061914000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FreedomIsFundamental</urlname><id>1191429</id><group_lat>41.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4599990845</group_lon><name>FREEDOM IS FUNDAMENTAL Book Club and Discussion Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216259102000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Freedom Is Fundamental Book Club and Film Screening</name><id>8355614</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217889000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FreedomIsFundamental/events/8355614/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/c/global_4498908.jpeg</photo_url></item>
