Grappling with multiple realities - and multiple personalities - he must retreat into his mind in pursuit of the truth. In a fictional film about non-fictional events, there is a place where belief and faith will blind you, where nothing is sacred, and to get there all you have to do is ask:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://wkjo.com/stream/" target="_blank"&gt; &amp;quot;Who Killed John O'Neill?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This an unusual and challenging film, befitting the nature of the 9/11 tragedies. We hope you enjoy (?), or at least get something from this film. It's different than the purely documentary-type of films we have been showing, but it's very interesting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A little background about John O'Neil:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._O%27Neill" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: John Patrick O'Neill (February 6, 1952 â€“ September 11, 2001) was a top American anti-terrorism expert, who worked as a special agent and eventually Assistant Director in the Federal Bureau of Investigation until late 2001. In 1995, O'Neill began to intensely study the roots of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing after he assisted in the capture of Ramzi Yousef, who was the leader of that plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He subsequently learned of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and investigated the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia and the 2000 USS Cole bombing in Yemen. Partly due to personal friction he had within the FBI and federal government, O'Neill left to become the head of security at the World Trade Center, where he died at age 49 in the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2002, O'Neill was the subject of a Frontline documentary named &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/" target="_blank"&gt;The Man Who Knew&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the movie:&lt;/b&gt; On July 3rd, 1979, the CIA gave birth to Islamic Fundamentalism when President Carter signed a directive for United States Intelligence to provide radical Islamic thinking and arms to Afghan fighters, before the Soviet Union invaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and there is more. You'll have to see this movie to believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=======&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We gather at Liberty Books in Concord at 6:30 to help set up the screening room - be sure to bring snacks or a box of tea to support Jim's hospitality. Then at 7, we'll start with a little current events review and a tiny amount of business, then on to the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a FREE event, but we appreciate donations to pay for our Meetup group fees and for new videos.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297876242000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295981978000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Concord - Who Killed John O'Neil?</name><id>16181496</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297814400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/16181496/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/b/global_20757163.jpeg</photo_url></item>
