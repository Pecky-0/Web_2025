He is the youngest scholar named Senior Fellow in Brookings's 90-year history. In 2005, CNN named him to their &amp;quot;New Guard&amp;quot; List of the Next Generation of Newsmakers. In his personal capacity, Singer served as coordinator of the Obama-08 campaign’s defense policy task force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Singer is considered one of the world's leading experts on changes in 21st century warfare. He has written for the full range of major media and journals, [...] . He is also a founder and organizer of the U.S.-Islamic World Forum, a global conference that brings together leaders from across the US and the Muslim world (www.us-islamicworldforum.org). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;His first book &lt;u&gt;Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry&lt;/u&gt; (Cornell University Press, 2003) pioneered the study of the new industry of private companies providing military services for hire, an issue that soon became important with the use and abuse of these companies in Iraq. The book was named best book of the year by the American Political Science Association, among the top five international affairs books of the year by the Gelber Prize, and a “top ten summer read” by Businessweek. Singer continues to serve as a resource on the private military issue to the U.S. Congress, U.S. Department of Defense, CIA, and the European Union and he helped bring to light the role of private contractors in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal and the Halliburton contract controversies in Iraq. Singer’s work was featured in the History Channel documentary 'Soldiers for Hire' and he served as a consultant on the topic for the TV drama The West Wing&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Brookings Institute&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Brookings Institution is a nonprofit, public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. One of Washington's oldest think tanks, Brookings conducts research and education in the social sciences, primarily in economics, metropolitan policy, governance, foreign policy, and global economy and development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Its stated mission is to &amp;quot;provide innovative and practical recommendations that advance three broad goals: strengthen American democracy; foster the economic and social welfare, security and opportunity of all Americans; and secure a more open, safe, prosperous, and cooperative international system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Foreign Policy Think Tank Index ranked Brookings as the #1 U.S. think tank in 2009. The organization's president, Strobe Talbott, was United States Deputy Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About CSAIL&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/node/4"&gt;http://www.csail.mit....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Computation lies at the heart of understanding all physical and biological systems. Many solutions to the most challenging problems of our lives, our work, and our world, therefore, are based in computation. MIT’s &lt;b&gt;Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory&lt;/b&gt; (CSAIL) studies this vast, compelling field in an effort to unlock the secrets of human intelligence, extend the functional capabilities of machines, and explore human/machine interactions. We apply that knowledge with a long-term lens to engineer innovative solutions with global impact&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Technology and Culture Forum at MIT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/tac/about/index.html"&gt;http://web.mit.edu/ta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Technology shapes the modern world and MIT is a world leader in shaping technology. It is imperative that MIT students, faculty, and staff, not only engage in, but lead the dialogue about the potential change. For forty years, the Technology and Culture Forum has provided the only on-going, Institute-wide arena for such issues to be discussed&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>A "Hello My Name is T.J." nametag, a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
