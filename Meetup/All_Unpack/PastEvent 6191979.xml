Where: Rockport, MA

When: September, Saturday 29th. Meet at noon, return when we're done!

Price: Just a couple of bucks to the drivers for gas!

Let's invade Rockport, MA on Saturday, September 29th! The fall air, the ocean breeze, and Motif #1. What could be better?

For those who haven't been to Rockport before, its a historic seaside town with a small protected harbor, historic buildings, rock jetties, beaches, shops, and tight streets. There is plenty to photograph here. For more info on Rockport:

The plan is to meet at the Park and Ride in Millbury near the intersections of RTs 20, 146 and the Pike. This should be pretty central for WPC meet-uppers. We'll pile into as few cars as we can manage and head up to Rockport (short lunch stop along the way likely) for an arrival around 2. We'll stay and shoot until 6 or 7 before coming back. I don't plan to be in a rush to get back but I understand some might have schedules to keep. We'll try to organize the cars and their passengers so that those who want to leave at a certain time are riding together.</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191255005000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187286486000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's invade Rockport, MA on Saturday, September 29th- Click and Shoot</name><id>6191979</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191081600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/6191979/</event_url></item>
