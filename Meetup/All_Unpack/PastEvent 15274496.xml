Children are definitely a welcome part of this celebration, and we are providing activities for all ages! Feel free to join in at any point, share the whole day with us, or just come for one part...&lt;br /&gt;The plan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;11-1:&lt;/span&gt; Gather in Cedar Hill Cemetery to wander, leave offerings on grave sites we feel drawn to, and take in the beauty of ...this Autumn day. We will share a simple snack and some Samhain stories, talk about and remember our beloved dead, and gather some sticks to create our Ancestor Sticks, which are a tool for helping us communicate with our ancestors. For this project, please bring with you some scraps of fabric, ribbon or string to decorate the sticks. Materials that actually came from an ancestor are especially appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;**break**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;3-5 pm:&lt;/span&gt; Pumpkin carving! Bring a pumpkin and tools to carve if you have them. We will light them all together as it grows dark... Then, clean up and children (and adults) gather to hear the Samhain story, &amp;quot;Vasalisa.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;5:30 pm: Circle together, and Molly will conduct a short sunset fire ritual as we transition from day into night...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;5:45-8 pm:&lt;/span&gt; Altar-building... Please bring any items you would like to add to the altar for the evening. Some suggestions: symbols of the season like twigs, fallen leaves, gourds, pumpkins - as well as pictures or objects of your beloved dead that you wish to honor and connect with this night. Skull or skeleton figures are also appropriate, as well as special stones or crystals, candles, or anything else that speaks to you.&lt;br /&gt;We will have a couple craft projects for children and anyone else that would like to do them. We'll decorate Day-of-the-Dead skulls, and there will be more sticks around for anyone who would like to make an ancestor stick who is joining us at this point.&lt;br /&gt;On the chalk board wall, we will, as a community, create an ancestor &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; but we will focus on the roots - our &amp;quot;roots,&amp;quot; where we come from, how we might connect to one another. Feel free to add yourself to the tree.&lt;br /&gt;We will also share a potluck dinner. Vegetarian, vegan and raw vegan dishes are welcome. Appropriate Samhain foods would be things like root veggies, apples, nuts, dark bread, pumpkin and foods of our ancestors - If your grandma had an amazing dish that you love and remember her by, this is the time to share it! Please be sure to write down the ingredients in your dish as there are many people with allergies/sensitivities/special diets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;8-midnight:&lt;/span&gt; The evening Samhain party!!! (for all ages) Please come in costume!!! We'll start things out with singing a simple Samhain song together. There will be live music as well as some great dancing tunes for us to rock out together! We'll have an elixir bar set up for the evening with some herbal-superfood magic brews to enliven and bewitch you... as well as some luscious desserts for sale... There will be a costume contest, so be prepared! Categories: Most Magnificent Overall Adult Costume, Simply Most Splendid Child's Costume, Most Eco-friendly Costume (made using recycled materials), and Best Handmade (not store bought) Costume... We'll celebrate and dance and keep the Goddess-fire burning in our hearts tonight as we come together as a community.
