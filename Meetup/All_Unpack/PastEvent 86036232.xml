Please come to both events (Tues &amp;amp; Fri) if possible - WE NEED YOU to make a difference! This is the second in a proposed week long protest against Yale Vivisection for National Primate Liberation Week 2012. Let's make our presence known on behalf of animals! &lt;br /&gt;

 Please spread the word to your animal network and join us. &lt;br /&gt;

 Yale University imprisons, tortures &amp;amp; murders over 150,000 animals including primates, dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, ferrets, rodents, and others. &lt;br /&gt;

 Yale experimenters have drilled holes into the skulls of animals, stuck needles into their brains, forced them to consume dangerous drugs including cocaine, and have subjected them to electrical shocks. &lt;br /&gt;

 There is almost no end to the ways that animals suffer in Yale labs before being killed. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale considers this to be a humane and responsible use of animals and experimenters document their abuses in academic papers that boost their careers rather than bring them jail time. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please join us in exposing these Ivy League abusers and in standing up for animals! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaflets and signs will be provided; but feel free to make your own signs if you prefer. &lt;br /&gt;

 Let us know if you need transportation. &lt;br /&gt;
