I have not been able to attend the meetings, but I still pay the fee every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone else would like to step up and pay this fee every month, be my guest, If I step down as organizer and another does not take my place the group will be dissolved by Meetup.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know of an unused classroom where we can meet, perhaps we can finally have a meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541438000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179273998000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Digital Arts June Meetup</name><id>5781886</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1182294000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/5781886/</event_url></item>
