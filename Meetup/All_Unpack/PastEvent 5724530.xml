Neither do we! So come watch Dr. Paul confuse his competition with phrases like &amp;quot;Founding Fathers,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;powers not granted,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;individual liberty.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the west - Take Rt. 16 east/south past and through the traffic circle, continue south on Rt.1 by-pass. About a mile south of the traffic circle, you will see the Bowl-O-Rama sign to the left. Continue a few hundred feet to the traffic light. Turn left at the light into a small shopping center (the will be a mexican restaurant called Margarita's right there). Go left in the parking lot toward the Bowl-O-Rama. The entrance to Scoreboard is actually inside the doors to Bowl-O-Rama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From I-95 - Take the exits for 16/1/traffic circle. Go south on Rt.1 by-pass. Continue as above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the south on Rt.1 - Take route 1 north. The Bowl-O-Rama/Scoreboard is right at the split of Rt.1 and Rt.1 by-pass. Stay to the right and take Rt.1 towards downtown Portsmouth but the Bowl-O- Rama is right there at the split.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178410135000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177941167000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Debate Watching Party!
