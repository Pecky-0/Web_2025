WaterFire's sparkling bonfires, the fragrant scent of aromatic wood smoke, the flickering firelight on the arched bridges, the silhouettes of the firetenders passing by the flames, the torch-lit vessels traveling down the river, and the enchanting music from across the world all engage the senses and emotions of those who stroll the paths and bridges of Waterplace Park. WaterFire has captured the imagination of many thousands of people, bringing life to downtown, and continues to revitalize Rhode Island's capital city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187645948000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184869043000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterfire in Providence, Aug 18</name><id>6048008</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187472600000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6048008/</event_url></item>
