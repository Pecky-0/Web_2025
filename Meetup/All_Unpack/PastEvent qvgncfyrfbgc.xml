Their work rakes in millions of dollars, but the biggest illusion yet is their friendship, for -- now -- time and familiarity have bred contempt between them. When a street magician's increasing popularity threatens to knock them off their thrones, Burt and Anton recognize that they have to repair the relationship and salvage the act. &lt;br /&gt;
