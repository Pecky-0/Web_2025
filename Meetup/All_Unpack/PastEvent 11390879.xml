I need at least one more smore and a roaring fire to official end the season. Dinner on Saturday night will be at Woodstock station to officially try out the October brew.  Spend Friday and Saturday night camping at Hancock Campground with a hike on Saturday to Liberty, and possibly Flume depending on circumstances.  The rocky, open summit of Liberty offers excellent views and a spectacular place to relax and hang out.  We will also be joining Random Hikers from Boston so this is an opportunity to meet different hikers.  On Sunday we will do a more moderate hike at a relaxing pace probably near waterfalls. &lt;br /&gt;Mt. Liberty is 8.0 miles round trip via the Whitehouse, Liberty Spring Trail, Franconia Ridge Trail. &lt;br /&gt;Elevation gain 3,250 feet &lt;br /&gt;Elevation 4459 feet &lt;br /&gt;Join for camping, hiking, or both.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;Paula&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a 10.00 charge for people who are camping to pay for the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a level four hike due to distance, elevation gain, and difficulty.  Experienced hikers only please.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>to be determined later</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula</member_name><member_id>5505578</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255310396000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253138634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hiking Mt.
