<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi all, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seemed to be quite a bit of interest in watching the Eurocup final this Sunday and Markus generously offered his home as the venue - thanks Markus!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe everyone can bring a few snacks, beer, soda, bloody mary mix was also mentioned??  Whatever floats your boat!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game actually starts at 2:45 and I have included Markus's phone number as there was no apartment number in his address.  Just thought I would be safe - we don't want Ebru driving around the neighborhood looking for the apartment again, jot that number down Ebru!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nele and I will be there supporting Deutschland, hope you can all join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Brad&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ring Doorbell</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Taylor</member_name><member_id>1999104</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215008112000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214509076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eurocup Final Game - Germany vs.</name><id>8222007</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214762400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/8222007/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
