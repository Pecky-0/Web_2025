Lunch will be provided. Fees for this meetup also cover airfare and accommodations for our speaker Mother Clare Watts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topic for this meetup is Devotion - The True Path To God &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God gave us intelligence, life, strength, health, feelings, and creativity. God gave us the Light by which to see, the energy to get things done, and the ability to Love. Devotion is this Love expressing from our hearts. Devotion is acknowledging that God is the Divine Source and power behind everything. Join us for this seminar-a discussion and experience of what it truly means to live a life filled with Devotion and Love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sounds good to you please also note these additional seminars with Mother Clare: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, February 14th: The Joy of Being Single ($25) &lt;br /&gt;Friday, February 15th: Love, Sex and God ($25) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings, &lt;br /&gt;Rev.
