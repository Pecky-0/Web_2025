You voted, and the Organizers of the South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group have heard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carmen's Mexican and American Restaurant is one of those places that has been a neighborhood institution for years, although in this case the neighborhood has changed to East Bridgewater from their former location in Abington. Known for family style dining featuring dishes like sizzling fajitas and Texas chile as well as more adventurous offerings like mariscos arroz (shrimp, scallops and mussels sauteed in garlic butter with onions, peppers and tomatoes, served over rice and topped with melted cheese), Carmen's also has a wide selection of margaritas and other cocktails, for those so inclined. The menu includes American dishes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be our first foray into the world of Tex-Mex as well as our first real weeknight event. Please join us on Tuesday evening, April 24, at 7:30 PM as SSDOMG's ongoing adventure in dining continues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Carmens is located at 34 Bedford St (Route 18) in East Bridgewater.
