Please R.S.V.P. now for this free event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Maine State Director of The Humane Society of the United States, I am excited to meet animal advocates in our community.  Please attend this meeting to become part of a grassroots movement for animal protection in Maine. At this meeting we will talk about personal disaster preparedness for yourself and your pets, and will follow that topic with an overview of animal welfare issues and initiatives that need your help here in Maine.  Please attend this meeting and don't forget to invite your friends!&lt;br /&gt;This event is free of charge, but an R.S.V.P. is requested to attend.
