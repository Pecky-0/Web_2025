It appears the latter is the case. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revealing human foibles with sly humor and underlying sweetness, director Jorge Gaggero tells the touching story of a spoiled socialite trying to keep the maid who has served her almost 30 years. Beba (diva Norma Aleandro, Best Actress at the Cannes Festival for The Official Story), clings to the elegant Buenos Aires apartment she can no longer afford. Her stoic and phlegmatic live-in maid Dora (Norma Argentina) knows her better than anyone. Owed many months salary, Dora is at last pushed to the limits of the complexities that bind her to her employer?though after so many years they are more like family than simply boss and worker. Winner, Special Jury Prize, 2005 Sundance Film Festival.  Kendall description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;First-time filmmaker Jorge Gaggero manages to distill a remarkable quantity of poetic gold and psychological truth from this simplest of set-ups, peeling away the shared history of these women with brief but telling snippets of information.&amp;quot; Newsday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to a complete review: &lt;a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/chocano/cl-et-maid31aug31,0,2680046.story" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.calendarli...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is the custom, Tom will be holding a meetup sign near the front row at the film's conclusion and then its off to a local restaurant to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193239533000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191810638000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live-in Maid   A Chamber Piece from Argentina</name><id>6508388</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192998600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6508388/</event_url></item>
