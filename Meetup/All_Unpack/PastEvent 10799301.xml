<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell by the calendar, there will be NO Prudential Meetup today since it's the 4th of July.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I wanted to ask our local community if anyone is without plans.  I will go to watch fireworks near the the Harvard/Mass Ave bridge tomorrow night, and you are welcome to join me.  The 4th of July is an important holiday for the United States, so if anyone has not had the opportunity to enjoy this holiday, please join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong about the time -&amp;gt; THE FIREWORKS WILL NOT START UNTIL AROUND 10:30 PM, but I will try to be there by 5 or 6 to secure a good location, if not earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if any of our Japanese members would like to volunteer, I will be taking a short hanabi video to put on a Japanese language learning site, and we could use a few native Japanese speakers to say a few short words about Boston no hanami in Japanese.  If you are interested, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See everyone again in two more weeks at the next Prudential Meetup, and keep watching our calendar for upcoming events!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.july4th.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.july4th.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Thank you to everyone who volunteered to be Assistant Organizers.  Please expect to be contacted within the next few days to set up times that we can talk.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send an e-mail including my cell phone number to anyone who has signed up by late tomorrow morning.
