We provide informative guests at each meeting made up of constitutionalists, economists, candidates and anyone else that can help to educate our members on issues of concern. Our government has gone out of control and we intend on reigning it back within it's constitutional role. &lt;br /&gt;The group is made up of citizens and is non partisan. We urge all citizens that are concerned about the over reaching of our government to join and get active. We have a great history of wonderful speakers and we have a great group of 912r's. Get active and join us!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.6</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1241780502000</created><lat>43.2700004578</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>7040</id><urlkey>constitutionalist</urlkey><name>Constitutionalist</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15010</id><urlkey>the912project</urlkey><name>The 912 Project</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>16240</id><urlkey>liberty</urlkey><name>Liberty</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18432</id><urlkey>freedom</urlkey><name>Freedom</name></topics_item></topics><name>Rochester 912 Project</name><id>1452537</id><members>278</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>9270878</member_id><name>Jerry DeLemus</name></organizer><urlname>rochester-912-project</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/d/c/600_13852444.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/d/c/highres_13852444.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>13852444</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/d/c/thumb_13852444.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Rochester</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/rochester-912-project/</link><lon>-71.0100021362</lon></item>
