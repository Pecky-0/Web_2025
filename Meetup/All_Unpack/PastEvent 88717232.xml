Yep, that is right!! Lets send a message LOUD and CLEAR that as voters we have many presidential candidates to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for Round 2 of the fair, equal and honest third party debate between libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green candidate Jill Stein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay, it's official!! The Cheers at Faneuil Hal...l will have the honor of hosting our debate party. We will have the downstairs section with a full cash bar and the regular food menu available. Just ask for the debate party at the door and they will direct you. I really hope Sam Malone is working that night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come watch, drink and socialize with fellow liberty lovers as we rock the establishment by refusing to accept the two party system!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351653144000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1690</urlname><id>950430</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351285228000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Join us for our "We Refuse To Accept The 2 Party System" Debate Party!!!</name><id>88717232</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351641600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1690/events/88717232/</event_url></item>
