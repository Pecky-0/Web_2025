Let's meet at 7:30 at the up escalators to the left, just past the front doors.     For those who are new, I wear a little badge to help people recognize me.   Please be as prompt as possible.  We like to go in a bit early so we can sit together.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, this movie theater can be quite busy on Saturday nights...I recommend buying your tickets ahead of time if you can.  I bought mine on Fandago already! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do check the web site for rsvp changes throughout the day on Saturday.  If your plans change please update the web site so the group doesn't hang around waiting for a no show.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people are interested, after the show, we can descend on a local establishment for food/drinks.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171934950000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169206800000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Breach</name><id>5407349</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171758600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5407349/</event_url></item>
