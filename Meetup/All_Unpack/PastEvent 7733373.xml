IF YOU QUESTION THE NEIGHBORHOOD?  I felt very safe. The last time we were there, being women, as we went to leave, we were followed out to our cars by their security....... without even having to ask! Parking is not a problem. They have VALET prkg. Also, 2 + lots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Some of us will be meeting up earlier for dinner @ Pho Dakao. INTERESTED?&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there &lt;br /&gt;_Jo &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tables will be reserved for our group towrd the back.
