<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Laurel Marsh Trail loop is about 3 miles. Mostly easy hike great for beginning hikers with some sections including raised boardwalk over the marsh and bridges. Some wet areas, a few small hills, great Hockanum River and marsh views, water birds, mature forest, giant white pines, and mountain laurel. Park at Laurel Marsh parking lot on south side of Middle Turnpike West (Route 44) just east of I-84, Exit 60, and meet there at 1 PM. The lot is not well marked but can be seen with a low but heavy wooden fence. It is a small lot, so car-pooling is encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike should take about 2 hours at a social (slow) pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear waterproofed hiking boots or winter boots. Hiking pole(s) are recommended but not required. Microspikes or other traction device for your boots on ice is recommended to be brought along but not too likely we will need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids and Dogs on leash are fine if well behaved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
