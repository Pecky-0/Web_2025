These are GREAT tours, for only $1 you get to see behind the scenes at the Red Hook Brewery and then get to sample some of their great tasting beers, and you even get to keep the glass. Let's meet near the souvenir desk (that's where you get your tickets) before 2pm for the tour, then anyone who would like to remain afterwards and enjoy more beer and late lunch would be more than welcome. See you at Redhook.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob Lamothe</member_name><member_id>6364190</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1328131327000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326733383000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Late Lunch and a Tour at Red Hook Brewery</name><id>48308562</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327863600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/48308562/</event_url></item>
