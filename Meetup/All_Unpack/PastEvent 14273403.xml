Some of you know it for past meetups and it the popular choice for hiking the Bentley Loop Trail.  Good access from Headquarters or the East Entrance on Long Pond Road.  This lot I often call the Middle Lot because its pretty-much right in the center of Myles Standish State Forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll shuttle 3-4 min away to Circuit Road and do a nice hike - but we can stay right there and do the Bentley if you like.   Bring a snack and water; hopefully it'll be a repeat of this morning.  Cool &amp;amp; dry !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good dogs, as well as good friends &amp;amp; kids able to hike 2-1/2mph for 90 min tops are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>8840771</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280743378000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280598042000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Sunday Hike 8/1/10 TIME CHANGE 9:45AM</name><id>14273403</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280667600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/14273403/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/5/global_14344581.jpeg</photo_url></item>
