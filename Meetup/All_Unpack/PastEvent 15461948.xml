<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a pretty section of New Hampshire coast line. The hiking trails are quite flat and the trails are on solid ground, (i.e. you don't sink in the sand).  Odiorne State Park offers an extensive array of habitats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Walk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Science Center lot at 10:00 AM and start the hike at 10:10. The walk will be about 3-4 miles long. There are numerous turn back points for those who want a shorter walk.  For those who would like to join us, we'll head to Petey's for lunch following the walk.  They do not allow dogs at the park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to Bring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wear layers and wind gear as it can be chilly near the water.  Also, hiking boots would be preferable to sneakers, if you plan to walk out on to the rocks, or the jetty.  Binoculars and a camera might also be nice to have along.  There is a view of the isle of shoals and multiple light houses.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hiker Code of Conduct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please try not to get too far ahead of the group. I go to a lot of effort to organize these walks, and it's not enjoyable when people run ahead and create their own event. If you have an emergency, I completely understand. Otherwise, these are designed to be leisurely, social walks, with time to appreciate the critters around us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can always use more organizers, and if anyone feels that the pace of the walk is not appropriate for their needs, they should consider organizing their own event in the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Getting There&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address of the Seaside Science Center located within Odiorne Point State Park is &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;570 Ocean Blvd, Rye, NH 03870&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Their phone # is 603-436-8043. I would recommend using a GPS or mapping this out in advance as we got a little lost the first time we visited this location . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 95 North or South &lt;br /&gt;Take exit 5 off of Interstate 95 North or South toward US-1 Bypass/Portsmouth Circle. Go .6 mi. to the Portsmouth Traffic Circle. At the traffic circle, take the 1st exit onto US-1 Bypass S. Continue 1.3 mi. Continue onto Lafayette Rd (.7 mi). Turn left at Elwyn Rd and continue on this route for 1.4 miles. At the traffic circle, take the 2nd exit onto New Hampshire 1A S/Pioneer Rd. Continue to follow New Hampshire 1A S for 1.5 miles. The Science Center will be on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from the South some people may want to take Route 1A along the coast from Hampton Beach. It's a beautiful ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Some information on Odiorne&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;Odiorne Point is the largest undeveloped stretch of shore on New Hampshire's eighteen mile coast. Located three miles south of Portsmouth on Route 1A in Rye, Odiorne offers an extensive array of habitats. Just north, the shore evolves into a pebble beach which shelters a fresh water marsh. Along the way to Frost Point where a jetty extends into Little Harbor, lies a small sand dune environment. At the end of Little Harbor, Seavey Creek feeds the neighboring salt marsh. Extensive inland disturbances during World War II induced the growth of dense forests in various stages of succession. Large stone walls bound open fields. Fresh water systems are represented within the park by a man-made pond and marsh. Remnants of formal gardens and wildflowers grow side by side; and the man-made military bunkers lie hidden under mounds of earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;How the Waiting List Works&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When someone from the hike drops, everyone on the waiting list is automatically emailed. The first person on the the waiting list to add themselves to the hike will get in. I realize that this doesn't seem fair for the first person on the waiting list, if someone lower on the list gets in. However, I found that the automatic waiting list resulted in a very high percentage of no-shows. A number of people didn't check their email, even days before the hike, and therefore didn't know they had gotten in to the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking area with meetup stickers on.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1290387530000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289882210000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Slow Odiorne Point State Park Walk-Many Stops-Followed by Lunch</name><id>15461948</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290265200000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/15461948/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/0/global_19704000.jpeg</photo_url></item>
