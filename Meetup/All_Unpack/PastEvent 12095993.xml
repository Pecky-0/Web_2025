<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Each year, the Salvation Army sets up Angel Trees with ornaments corresponding to a needy childâ€™s wish for Christmas, and one of these trees is located at the Cambridgeside Galleria. Several families have requested help with buying their children gifts for Christmas, and as of Monday, December 14th, more than 58 children needed gifts bought for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, come join your fellow Republicans and friends on Saturday, December 19th at 4:30 PM to help fill this desperate need. Cambridgeside is accessible by the MBTA green line, and parking underneath the mall is only $4 all day. Afterwards, we hope that you will join us for dinner and/or drinks near the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tentative timetable:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:30 PM - 4:45 PM: Meet on second floor next to customer service counter - this is where the Angel Tree is. Someone will be near the tree to ensure that any questions are answered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:45 ~ 6:45 PM: Shopping followed by dropping off gifts (unwrapped) at the Angel Tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:45 PM: Post-shopping dinner/drinks/fun at Courtside (2 blocks from mall, near 3rd and Cambridge St.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>2nd floor, by customer service desk</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David</member_name><member_id>3754906</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261431403000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>(young) Republicans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>youngrepublicans-43</urlname><id>170358</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston (Young) Republicans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260968960000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Republican Angel Tree Meetup</name><id>12095993</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261258200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/youngrepublicans-43/events/12095993/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/8/global_12272216.jpeg</photo_url></item>
