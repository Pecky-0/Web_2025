Here are the details of the March meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a reminder: we start the meeting at 6:30 for those new to NLP, those who want a review, and those who want to come early to socialize/network.  At 7pm we will jump into the main event for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main event: New Possibilities for Getting and Staying Motivated – Learning What Works &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What motivates you?  What motivates others?  What will trigger a person into action? In what “direction” do they move?  Do they move toward an objective, or away from problems to be solved or prevented?  You will explore these and other extremely useful questions with our own Mark Ide.  Mark is a certified master professional leadership and management coach, and the co-founder and partner in New Possibilities Coaching.  I will be there as well, to assist Mark during the Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to discuss specific issues that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;We meet on the first floor of Sturtevant Hall, 197 Herrick Road, which is near the library on the central quad of Andover Newton. &lt;br /&gt;Andover Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
