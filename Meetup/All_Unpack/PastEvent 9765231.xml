Aaron Wolff is the son of New England Conservatory’s Director of Orchestras, Hugh Wolff, and will be featured in the Coen Brothers’ upcoming release, “A Serious Man.” The Newton South freshman will perform Popper’s Hungarian Rhapsody. The Boston Children’s Chorus brings together singers in grades 2-12 from 50 of Boston’s urban and suburban neighborhoods. Under the direction of Artistic Director Anthony Trecek-King, the chorus has performed in Chicago, Oregon, Mexico, at the Democratic National Convention, with the Boston Pops and on the annually televised Martin Luther King, Jr. Concert. The concert will also feature Mackenzie Hammel, a 17-year-old harpist from Cincinnati, OH playing selections from Suite of Eight Dances by Carlos Salzedo, flutist Alison Beskin, 18, from Atlanta, GA performing the second movement of Henri Dutilleux’s Sonatine, and Clifton Williams, a 17-year-old pianist from Washington, D.C who is a recipient of From the Top’s $10,000 Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist Award.
