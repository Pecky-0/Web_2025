After that we are planning on having a few drinks and dinner at the TAZZA Cafe on Westminster Street, hoping some of you could join us there for a fun Saturday night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you guys are up to it we could even go for a &amp;quot;pub crawl&amp;quot; and maybe even dancing in one of the many Providence Bars or Clubs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Carnival-time in Germany anyway :-)!! Time for some fun!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo, if you think that sounds kinda fun, then meet us at the TAZZA Cafe in a couple of weeks! I'd be happy to see you all again! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards and warm thoughts, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the black-red and yellow flag!!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238106984000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233284172000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner, drinks and.... dance??</name><id>9632433</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235262600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/9632433/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
