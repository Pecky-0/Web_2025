I have been going to Ace Archers for a few years now. Nice friendly staff, and they rent all equipment and show you how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price is $12/hr and includes all equipment you need. I know this is not scheduled for a weekend, and I would have to schedule with the archery venue for a date and time for a large group of up to 20 so they could have enough staff available. I figured this would be less formal this way. If more people want to try it later, then I will look into having a weekend event when time permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead of doing all of that. I am just posting this up for anyone who wants to try it on a Thursday night. I think there's also a class hosted on Thurs nights, so not sure of availability of staff to help more than 6-8 people. Just in case of some crazy popularity of this event on a Thursday, I will be placing a limit of 6 people for this event. Hopefully I can schedule one for&amp;nbsp; a weekend so more people can attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks! See ya there :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. GPS can be inaccurate getting to this place. It's by World Gym in a brick building near a pond. If you went past the pond, you probably went too far. If you're coming from the north headed down, then your GPS might take you 100 yards or so before you reach the place. So be careful with GPS directions and Google map it first.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305470272000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304103025000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Archery in Foxboro, Ace Archers on a Thursday</name><id>17482276</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1305241200000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/17482276/</event_url></item>
