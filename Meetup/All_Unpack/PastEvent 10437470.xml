<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'd like a headcount on who will be joining us for the weekend. RSVP soon! You need to bring water shoes and hope you don't get stuck in the mini rapids! We'll stop for lunch first then head to the river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a change of plans and we will not be spending the night at the hotel like we usually do. This will now be a day ride. This is a level 3 ride as we will be riding route 84 through Hartford Connecticut so we can get there to have enough time for tubing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the Dunkin Donuts for 8 leaving for 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: Lunch and $20 for tubing.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at Dunkin Donuts</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249906228000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242662786000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>River Tubing Weekend</name><id>10437470</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249732800000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/10437470/</event_url></item>
