Jovanotti, whose real name is Lorenzo Cherubini, was born in Rome on 27 September 1966. From the mix of hip hop, rap and disco of the early successes, however, Jovanotti departs gradually approaching to funk, world music and even classical arrangements and ska influences. As his musical influences changed, so too did his lyrics, which, over time, began to increasingly address philosophical, religious and political issues, which are more typical of the Italian cantautore tradition. Most of his songs are sung in the Italian language. His most famous songs are &amp;quot;L'Ombelico del Mondo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Serenata Rap&amp;quot;. Jovanotti has also appeared in one of Luciano Pavarotti's charity concert in 1996.&amp;quot;  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovanotti" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jovanotti's My Space page, with music:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/jovamusic" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $25 + 9 fees + $33&lt;br /&gt;They are general admission, standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To purchase tickets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.livenation.com/edp/eventId/415715" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.livenation...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will determine a place to meet for a drink prior to the show.
