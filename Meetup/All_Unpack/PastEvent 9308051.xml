Since the roads in that area are pretty busy with traffic I decided to move the starting location to &lt;b&gt;Commuter Lot&lt;/b&gt; near Dixwell Ave. &amp;amp; Hartford Tpke. in North Haven.  Seems to be the closest parking lot near a decent running road.   The address to use if you need to find it with GPS is 8 Devine Street - 06473.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mapped out a route that is 8 miles but there are convenient turn around points for running 4 or 6 miles.  We can decide on the distance based on the weather conditions in the morning. Below is a link to the proposed running route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/united-states/ct/north-haven/534702394430" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapmyrun.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Cummings</member_name><member_id>4930656</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230384893000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenRunners</urlname><id>426798</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228840002000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Commuter Lot - SUNDAY RUN</name><id>9308051</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229867100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenRunners/events/9308051/</event_url></item>
