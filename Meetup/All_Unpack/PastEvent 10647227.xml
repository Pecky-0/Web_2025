<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This time lets do BBQ (For those that haven't attended a meeting yet it is expected that you make what you bring - ie its a cooking club so don't just pick up brownies from the supermarket on the drive in....). I have a large gas grill so don't feel limited by space as to what you can make (ie beer but chicken, rack of lamb, or a big brisket will fit...)  As always make sure to amend your RSVP with the dish your are bringing so those joining up know what dishes will be needed to complete the meal. Also if you want to bring a friend have them sign up as an individual as well and bring a separate dish. Show up at 5:00 and we will start chowing down once the food starts coming off the grill.  Finally by signing up please consider this a commitment to attend - people are picking their dish based on what you sign up for - since those who attend are putting effort into getting their meal ready and the host as well getting their place ready - doing a no show or last minute cancel is contrary to the spirit of the group and will result in getting voted off the island...&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254011091000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club</urlname><id>1354358</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Near Boston 30 something cooking club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244950752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BBQ  </name><id>10647227</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246222800000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club/events/10647227/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/c/global_6879276.jpeg</photo_url></item>
