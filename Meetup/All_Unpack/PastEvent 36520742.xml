&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: McBride's Pub in Wayland Square!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening of McBride's Pub was a much anticipated event for the Wayland Square P-Collective folks early last summer. It instantly became a natural gathering place for the neighborhood - sitting outside on the patio for a pint or enjoying the cozy warmth of the large bar and bistro tables on a rainy night - its great! Did I mention that its also a funeral home? So this great meeting place has had a change in the last few weeks.....its open Monday nights!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those that know (and there are A LOT of you), and those that don't - yet. We're heading to McBride's - finally! Come over to the East Side and bring your good cheer. Hopefully the weather will be still be a little warm and let's celebrate the close to the long weekend at this warm local pub. Its a great one to know about - you'll be back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...Nothing cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're very friendly and hard to miss - just look lost......someone will say hello :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suzanne</member_name><member_id>3658033</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
