&lt;p&gt;Calling all music lovers! Jon Pousette-Dart (of Pousette Dart Band fame) is playing with some very talented local musician at the Adams Opera House in Derry. I saw him perform a couple of years ago and it was a fantastic show.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Tickets can be purchased at the door. Price is $22.50 for general admission at 8:00 or VIP tickets cost $28.50 and includes a Meet and Greet (light refreshments with the musicians) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at 7:00&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and preferred seating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be working the show so I can make sure you meet up with other Meetup folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pousette-Dart Band, led by Jon Pousette-Dart carved a place in the landscape of American music in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s. They were a mainstay of album radio, a favorite on the college circuit, and became one of the busiest touring groups in the US. While the original group dis-banded in the early 80&amp;rsquo;s, Jon kept performing with original drummer Eric Parker and continued writing and producing into the 90&amp;rsquo;s, when he returned to Nashville to begin recording again on his own. He turned out four more solo albums and recently released &amp;ldquo;Anti-Gravity&amp;rdquo;, a cohesive selection of his best songs to date. He has co-written with some of the finest writers in the country including, Darrell Scott, Gary Nicholson, Jaime Kyle, Kostas, John Bohlinger, Angelo, Sally Barris, Fred Knobloch, and Angela Kaset. &amp;lsquo;Heaven is Here&amp;rsquo; from youtube: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnpTVVUUqC0&amp;amp;feature=list_related&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;list=AVGxdCwVVULXc8jwrSYjv2vyiVvi3XnAdh"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnpTVVUUqC0&amp;amp;...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask Joan when you buy your ticket at the front desk</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joan Dg7</member_name><member_id>11561900</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321754120000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>fun folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dance-342</urlname><id>462174</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>Dance &amp; Activities Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321315128000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Concert: Jon Pousette-Dart with Harvest</name><id>41176912</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321749900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dance-342/events/41176912/</event_url></item>
