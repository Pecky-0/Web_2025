&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because Doherty's is renowned for their beer list, with over 82 beers on tap and even more in bottles at last count.&amp;nbsp; Its trivia night is famous for their stumpers and one of a kind "name that tune" round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on down as we make another showing. At the very least, its an occasion to sample their beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying you aren't any good at trivia is no excuse not to come out. Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every little bit helps and great conversation is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you know your music, even better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game starts close to 8:30 and runs for about 2 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 **** Try to get down there earlier, by at least 7:45 so that we can be seated. The place is fairly large but fills up fast. Finding seating has been extremely difficult the last couple of times. Any winnings will be applied to a future event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me with a meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>c</member_name><member_id>2264651</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1332951070000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330301023000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ Doherty's</name><id>53941862</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332891900000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/53941862/</event_url></item>
