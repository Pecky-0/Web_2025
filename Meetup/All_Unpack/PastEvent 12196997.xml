This is a great exercise for those who wish to improve how they see details when shooting. Whoever manages to find all of the items, and take photos of them, will have their name entered into a drawing for a special prize (TBA). More details to come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the hunt we'll meet for a bite to eat and to warm up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following dinner (around 5p.m.) we'll head back into Rockport for a night shoot. Our goal for this shoot will be to capture that classic, small town New England feel. The buildings I have in mind are historic or quaint, with classic decorations such as simple garland and wreaths. Think Norman Rockwell or even the villages of Department 56, and you'll know the feeling I'm hoping we'll capture. Examples are our fire stations, churches, and local historic homes or Inns. You may even get that perfect shot for next year's holiday card! While the buildings are lit fairly well, a tripod is highly recommended. Don't worry if you're not much for the cold, we will have a chance to warm up in our cars as we travel from place to place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can only join us for one segment of this shoot, please let me know when RSVP'ing. We'll meet at T-Wharf in Rockport for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272910094000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262446203000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rockport Photo Scavenger Hunt and Night Shoot</name><id>12196997</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263063600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/12196997/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_3584529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
