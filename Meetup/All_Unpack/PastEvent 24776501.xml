&lt;strong&gt;Top Rope Manager (221)&lt;/strong&gt; course on 
&lt;strong&gt;Sunday July 10'th, 10am&lt;/strong&gt; to learn how to setup ropes outdoors at such places as Quincy Quarries. This is a 6 hour course, Metrorock will provide the ropes and equipment. We'll learn how to setup all the different types of anchors and climb a variety of routes.&amp;nbsp; Ideally bring your harness and shoes, belay device, lots of water, lunch, helmet, snacks, sun screen, bug spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a climbing harness, belay device and shoe rentals please speak with Mike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the price breakdown I was offered:
 &lt;br /&gt;$175 for one-on-one,
 &lt;br /&gt;$150 per person for 2,
 &lt;br /&gt;$125 per person for 3,
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$100 per person for 4 or more people&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person to sign up will bring us to 3, and the second will bring us all down to $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should know how to tie in and how to belay and know how to climb 5.6+ routes at least. We'll meet in the parking lot at 10am sharp. If you need transportation, Mike or I can help arrange.&lt;/p&gt;
