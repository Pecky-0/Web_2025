So we will have our holiday dinner there on Monday evening, December 14th. It will be served family style. (passed bowls-take all you want) The menu will consist of individual Caprese Salad (bocconcini cheese &amp;amp; tomatoes), followed by family style servings of Penne Pasta in marinara sauce, then Eggplant Parmigiana &amp;amp; Chicken Marsala. American coffee and a mini cannoli will be our dessert. All of the above will cost $45, including tax (7%) and tip. (18%) Alcoholic beverages and soft drinks are extra. Please bring cash, as we expect a large gathering, so  individual checks or multiple charges will be difficult and time consuming. We'll have a cocktail hour for  mingling from 6:00-7:00, then sit down to dinner at about 7:00. The restaurant is located on the right-hand side of lower Hanover Street, across from the fire station. The dinner will be downstairs on the lower level. Please RSVP by Friday, December 11th at 5:00. It promises to be a wonderful evening among friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further event guidelines. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be at the bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263063958000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259621761000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lucia-Family Style Holiday Dinner</name><id>11983957</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260835200000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/11983957/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/a/global_7834474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
