We will start the group by listening to a pre-recorded talk on mindfulness and/or meditation, followed by a short meditation and discussion about our talk of the evening and what we can bring into our lives. While many talks are from practicing Buddhists, our group focuses on the philosophies of buddhism which are the root of mindfulness training. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world. We'd love to have you join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Please try to get there by 6:00pm as they have asked us to keep the door locked due to recent security issues. If you arrive after 6pm and there's no one at the door, please ring the night buzzer (it's right by the door and is labeled as there are two buzzers). We'll come down and get you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300237140000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288822783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Mindfulness Weekly Meetup</name><id>jdptpypfbsb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300140000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/16809479/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
