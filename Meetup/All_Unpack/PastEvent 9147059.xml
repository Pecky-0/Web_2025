Wonder Bowl in New Bedford has Cosmic Bowling (aka Rock N' Bowl) on Friday nights.  What better way to work off your turkey coma from the day before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the website for Wonder Bowl: &lt;a href="http://www.wonderbowl.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wonderbowl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 9pm near the entrance.  According to the website, it's $20/hour for up to 6 people per lane, but I was there last week and they were charging $14/hour during cosmic bowling.  This includes shoes.&lt;br /&gt;There is an attached bar where you can get drinks to bring back to the bowling alley, and snacks are available as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in meeting up for dinner first, we could do so around 7 in any one of the many fine establishments in New Bedford.  Please indicate in your reply whether you just want to bowl or if you want to meet up for dinner first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is also being posted for the South Shore 30+ Singles Meetup Group.  If you are a member of both groups, please RSVP to only 1 group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send out my cell phone number to Yes replies the day before the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Trina&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm tall!
