It's really beautiful and the perfect length hike for mid-week. The area features a lovely, lively trout stream, towering hemlocks and pines, a scenic footbridge, picnic tables, a walking trail and the remains of an earthen stone dam. This will also be a great summer picnic place on hot days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is about a 2 mile hike, but spots for available opt outs. The terrain is rocky and filled with roots, but nothing you can't handle. There are a couple steep hills and one very steep downhill, but after you do it once it's easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to bring water and snack if you'd like, well hang out as long as we have daylight. After for those who wish we will head to Box Seat just around the corner for a beverage and munchies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Please note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The parking is very limited, only 3 cars are able to park along the road, so depending on RSVP's we can meet just down the road and carpool up - will post as event gets closer.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>5999051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273359394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Funseeker</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>nefunseekers</urlname><id>1277691</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>Funseekers!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272235685000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mid-Week Mini Hike</name><id>13287622</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273185900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nefunseekers/events/13287622/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/d/global_11698477.jpeg</photo_url></item>
