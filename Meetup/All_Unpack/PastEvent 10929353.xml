<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Diego's is a new Mexican Restaurant in front of Fluke on Bowen's Wharf.  &lt;br /&gt;August 8, 2009 7:30 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice time of year to be on the Wharf...a great time to meet/greet new or old friends! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Dinner event with BYOB.  Bring whatever you would like to drink! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good food! Great company!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like Sangria bring wine (white or red) and they make a signature Sangria for an additional $4.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Dinner we plan to explore the wharf and check out some pubs in the area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reservations are tough to get during the summer in Newport so please keep your RSVP updated and be on time so we may all be seated together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking: If you are driving in to Newport the easiest and best priced parking lot is Mary's lot. Mary's lot is located off of Thames. Enter Thames St. at Banana Republic and make first left onto Mary Street, then right into Mary's lot. Diego's is through the archway on the wharf.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet me in front of Diego's - Lonnie - 401-829-8516</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lonnie</member_name><member_id>6911660</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249992787000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248230516000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner -Drinks (BYOB)  -  Summer Fun - Diego's -  Bowen's Wharf , Newport </name><id>10929353</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249774200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/10929353/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/b/global_9801931.jpeg</photo_url></item>
