Also, this 1 day only, they are having their annual &lt;a href="http://www.creativeartsworkshop.org/html/events/bowlathon.html"&gt;Bowl-A-Thon&lt;/a&gt; to raise funds to benefit the Community Soup Kitchen.  Donate at least $15 and receive a hand-made bowl or mug (that you keep!) of soup with fresh baked bread (you don't have to give back the food either...ewww!) (lower &amp;amp; higher price levels exist too).  Such a deal!  Food donated by local merchants, including Anny Liffey's and Edge of the Woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want even more of Creative Arts, the crafts start at 1 and the food at 1:30, so you can show-up before the concert if you like, then come back again after the concert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Creative Arts activities end at 5 (but you can always catch their &lt;a href="http://www.creativeartsworkshop.org/celebration/index.html"&gt;holiday sale&lt;/a&gt; on another day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part 3?:&lt;/b&gt; Who knows, after Creative Arts will we still be hanging-out doing something?  Time will tell. Hmmm, what's playing at Criterion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/members/2469731/"&gt;Alexis&lt;/a&gt;, cell 203-747-9203 (texting ok too).  However she will be unreachable for a while before the concert, as she'll be busy warming-up for it.  For directions or parking info you can call the venue, Neighborhood Music School, 203-624-5189.
