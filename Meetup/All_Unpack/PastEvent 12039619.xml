After the premiere, Haneke told The Times: “I see my films as a ski jump. It’s up to the spectator to decide whether to take off.” Critics have interpreted the film as an investigation of the roots of German fascism, but Haneke said that he intended it to have a much wider resonance as a warning about how any absolute value system leads eventually to terrorism. &amp;quot; - &lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Ben Hoyle, Correspondent in Cannes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.altfg.com/blog/festivals/michael-haneke-the-white-ribbon-cannes-2009/" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative Film Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director of Hidden, Director of Cache, Iconic Director in Person at the HFA for a showing of Funny Games, Michael Haneke's &lt;u&gt;The White Ribbon&lt;/u&gt; has been called by some, his best film to date.  Please be prepared for a Haneke film before RSVP'ing to this event!
