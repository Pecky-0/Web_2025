Given the season, the computer I am using was struck by a &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot;... after some days of &amp;quot;antibiotics&amp;quot; we are back in business. I hope you are enjoying this beautiful spring day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGARDING OUR UPCOMING MEETING, mark your calendar:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME:Our next meeting is going to be on Sunday March 29th, at 4:00PM.&lt;br /&gt;PLACE: PEACE ABBEY - located at: Two North Main Street, Sherborn, MA 01770in Sherborn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you know the format of our meetings is quite simple: we gather to share our reflections and reactions on what we read at home. For our next meeting (MARCH 29) we are going to share on chapter one: &amp;quot;RELATING TO CREATION&amp;quot; and specifically part 3 LIGHT (pages 50-79). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you not able to read the material &amp;quot;assigned&amp;quot;, don't worry and come anyway. It has always been my belief that our simple presence can still foster deep and creative interaction. Hope to see all of you on March 29. On our first meeting (March 1), the first 50 pages of this book have provided us with a lively and good inter-action... I am sure you will enjoy...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, mark your calendars and hope to see you at the meeting. Enjoy this new wonderful book and have a great day. Blessings on you and your families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEACE&lt;br /&gt;Fr.
