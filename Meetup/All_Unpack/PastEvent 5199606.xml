<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Two locations this Sunday -- but please note -- we've been overburdening Doggie Day with our large numbers, and the Brookline locale for this meetup only can only accomodate around 10 dogs. For future indoor meetups, we'll have to limit the # of RSVPs. For this one -- please try to help by limiting guests and please make sure to note which location. IF anyone knows of a third place for this weekend -- let us know.    - S &amp;amp; S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Doggie Day per usual - 11am -- 400 Tremont Street in Boston  &lt;br /&gt;2. Paws for a Cause -- 10:30am -- 1386 Beacon Street in Brookline (Coolidge Corner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to RSVP accordingly, so we can keep track of the numbers. I'll be hosting a &amp;quot;Guess the Treats&amp;quot; contest. Prizes for the pooches included! Look forward to seeing everyone there. Stay warm.... Susana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, please note in your RSVP which location you'll be attending. :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2067938</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1163520438000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>Chihuahua Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>chihuahua-99</urlname><id>32412</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Chihuahua Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>43</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160928044000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chihuahua November Meetup</name><id>5199606</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163347200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chihuahua-99/events/5199606/</event_url></item>
