Blending poetry from the 16th-century Spiritual Canticle written by St. John of the Cross during his imprisonment in Toledo, Spain, with music from a variety of such composers as medieval Magister Perotinus and Spanish Renaissance composer Cristóbal de Morales. &lt;br /&gt;The works are musically juxtaposed with Arvo Pärt’s contemporary minimalism, whose purity of expression is also reminiscent of St. John’s language and works by Henryk Góreki. The drama plays out as actors portray St. John as prisoner, and his guard, who is transformed as he witnesses the poetry of his captive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TICKET PRICES&lt;br /&gt;MFA members, seniors, and students $20; general admission $25. &lt;br /&gt;Purchase tickets online  www.mfa.org/concerts, in person at any MFA ticket desk, or by phone at 617-369-3306.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is wheelchair accessible.
