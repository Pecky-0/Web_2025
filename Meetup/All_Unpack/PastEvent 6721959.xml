NO MARCH MEETUP - SEE YOU IN APRIL INSTEAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are rescheduling our first meetup of the year to April.  The second Sunday in March is scheduled to be cold and windy and sunless, which doesn't bother the Puggies in the least, but it sure does bother the Puggies' owners, not to mention that Shar's back yard can be a pretty scarey place before it's been spiffed up for spring - and mine looks even worse than hers!  So.... same place, same time, different month - see you in April!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are looking forward to having quite a few new people at the next meetup, and some of the oldtimers have new Puggies, so we're looking forward to seeing everybody, both old and new.  Clovis, Stoney, and Cletus can hardly wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was last year!   Can you imagine?  Last year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you think the cold weather and early twilight hour kept anyone home?  Not a chance!  The more delicate among us put on coats (people) and sweaters (Pugs), and at least 40 people and 50 Pugs showed up for Buford's, Millie's, and Max's birthday party meetup in Carver, and some of them even brought presents.  Shar made goodie bags for all the Puggie guests and a huge pan of liver brownies which all the Pugs gathered eagerly around to devour.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pugs ran and ran and ran, kids and puppies tumbled underfoot, and even a stuffed Pug (toy) made the rounds.  It's so much fun to watch so many Pugs having such a good time! Thanks so much to Shar for making her yard available - is it my imagination, is the yard getting smaller, or is the crowd just getting bigger?   Thanks so much also  to Christopher for taking so many excellent pictures, and then posting them before most of us had even managed to get out of our cars!  Clovis is still passed out on the big doggie bed opposite my desk, snoring away, deep under the influence of too many brownies and too much excitement.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did everyone have a great time?  We know they did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have! If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>shar</member_name><member_id>2833949</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208521209000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>39</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194811824000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug April Meetup</name><id>6721959</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208109600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/6721959/</event_url></item>
