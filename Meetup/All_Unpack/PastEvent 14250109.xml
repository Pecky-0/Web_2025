Science, Pop Culture, Current Events, Music, History, Geography, Literature, Sports, TV, Art, Business, &amp;amp; Movies are some common categories.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stump! Trivia rules:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) To be eligible for prizes, teams are limited to six players. Be aware, teams with less than six players and have one of the top three scores, win first or second place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The trivia jockey (TJ) provides Stump! sheets, on which to keep your team score. Write the categories as the TJ reads them, and keep track of the points you've wagered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) When the TJ asks a question, you have one song to write your team name, your answer, and your wager on an answer ticket and hand it in. You can wager 1, 3, 5, or 7 points in the first two quarters, and 2, 4, 6, or 8 points in the last two quarters. You can only use each value ONCE per quarter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) There are three bonus rounds where you can earn lots of extra points! Your TJ will explain how they work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) No shouting out answers, and absolutely no using cellphones or other devices to look up answers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;center&gt;Teams breaking this rule are disqualified.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Have fun and good luck.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the hostess for the Meetup seats</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick</member_name><member_id>5798433</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283391965000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280385102000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kinsale Happy Hour on Wednesday September 1st, 2010</name><id>14250109</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283378400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/14250109/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/8/4/global_12290692.jpeg</photo_url></item>
