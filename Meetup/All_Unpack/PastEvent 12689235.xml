<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This hike will be a looping hike just south of Rt. 4 in Burlington, CT. I estimate the hike will be about 6.5 miles of lower to moderate difficulty. We would hike on the Main Line Tunxis Trail as well as the White Dot trail and Punch Brook Trail. We have not hiked in this area before so we are checking it out to see what we find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will park at Sessions Woods parking area and shuttle to the starting location due to limited parking there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail Map&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;Can be found in the &amp;quot;Connecticut Walk Book: West&amp;quot; 19th edition, by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, as Map TU-3c, on page 320.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meetup location&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;Parking lot at Sessions Woods is at 341 Milford Street (Route 69) in Burlington.  It is 3.3 miles from Rt. 4 and 3 miles from Rt. 6 in Bristol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Burlington&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=341+Milford+Street&amp;amp;zipcode=06013" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limited Trailhead Parking&lt;/b&gt; (2 - 3 cars?) we will shuttle to on Rt. 4 in Burlington, approximate location:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Burlington&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=141+Spielman+Hwy&amp;amp;zipcode=06013-1808&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.774516&amp;amp;longitude=-72.945144&amp;amp;geocode=ADDRESS" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== &lt;b&gt;Legal Stuff&lt;/b&gt; ===&lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
