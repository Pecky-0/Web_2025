&lt;p&gt;Akari is the daughter of the time-traveling teen from the anime classic The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. In order to help her mother, she travels from the present to the 1970s, where she must contend with a world without instant communication and meet her father, who she never knew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE GIRL WHO LEAPT THROUGH TIME &lt;br /&gt;

 Directors: Mamoru Hosoda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run Time: 98 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makoto Konno regards herself as a normal high-school student. She's smart, but not brilliant; a little clumsy, but not a klutz; well-liked, but not a social star. Her favorite pastime is playing baseball with her best friends: handsome, studious Kosuke Tsuda and shaggy, offbeat Chiaki Mamiya. When Makoto nearly loses her life in a bicycle accident, she escapes by moving back through time. Her aunt tells her the talent isn't unusual in girls her age, and Makoto begins exploiting her ability. But her efforts to improve the present backfire, making school, friendship, and romance even more complicated and difficult--until she discovers a surprising secret about Chiaki. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo) has remained a popular property in Japan since Yasutaka Tsutsui's novel appeared in 1967: It's been filmed repeatedly in live action and adapted to a manga. Mamoru Hosoda's animated prequel to the original story blends warmth and fantasy in ways usually associated with Studio Ghibli films. The relationship Makoto, Kosuke, and Chiaki share is exceptionally well-drawn, and nicely balances the fantastic elements of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
