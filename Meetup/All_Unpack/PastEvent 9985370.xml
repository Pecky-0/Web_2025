There's plenty of spring skiing still to be had up in the Mount Washington Valley. With great weather for spring skiing, this is always a popular weekend every year and we'll have a lot of club members up at the Brettl-Hupfers lodge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our lodge is located within 2 minutes of Attitash and 20 minutes of Bretton Woods and Wildcat. This is a great weekend to come ski with a great group of people and have some fun afterwards. Guests are welcome for $20 per night lodging at the club. Full details and information will be sent to all Yes RSVPs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All members and guests must be 21+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you up!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come on into the lodge and say hello</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Harty</member_name><member_id>8116925</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239446987000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1342211</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Brettl-Hupfers Ski &amp; Sports Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237428571000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend at the Bretts March 27th to 29th</name><id>9985370</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238202000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club/events/9985370/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/5/global_6726629.jpeg</photo_url></item>
