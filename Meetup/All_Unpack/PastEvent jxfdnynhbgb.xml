Esther Hicks, a best-selling author &amp;amp; inspirational speaker, says she dialogues with or &amp;quot;channels&amp;quot; a group of spiritual teachers collectively known as &amp;quot;Abraham.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through video &amp;amp; audio clips, we'll watch/listen and discuss our impressions &amp;amp; experiences using LoA as taught by Abraham.  As always, we'll enhance our discussions with practical “How To”s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topics include....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Did you know that there are 2 DVD versions of  The Secret? Why was Abraham featured only in the original first version? Why was Abraham not “invited” to Oprah 's TV show &amp;amp; only showcased on her XM Radio show?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) What is the &lt;i&gt;Secret&lt;/i&gt; Behind &amp;quot;The Secret&amp;quot; that was suppressed? How do you align with this &lt;i&gt;Secret&lt;/i&gt; to follow your bliss?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&amp;gt;We are fortunate that &lt;b&gt;Ann Ide&lt;/b&gt;, BostonLOA member &amp;amp; New Possibilities Life Coach, will guide us in a meditation to connect with this &amp;quot;Secret&amp;quot;. She will also give us a &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; to use daily to strengthen the connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) How do you shift away from “sloppy” thinking to “focused, empowered” thinking in 1 minute or less for blissful living?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For folks new to Abraham, go here for list of free resources.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, SHARE your resources too.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/messages/boards/thread/8984866"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/messages/boards/thread/8984866"&gt;http://lawofattractio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Ann Ide:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.NewPossibilitiesCoaching.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann is a certified master practitioner in Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) and Hypnotherapy, and a certified NLP Life Coach with over 15 years experience.
