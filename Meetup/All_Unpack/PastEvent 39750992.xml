<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;***UPDATE*** This bushwhack trip is closed to new RSVP activity, however if you are ready for this type of a trip, you can email me and IF WE COMMUNICATE, you can be added to the list. Please do not just email me and assume that's it and show up. We need to make sure you are a good fit for the conditions expected. If so you will hear back. Also note the 24 hours before the trip is is unlikely we will be able to respond so do not delay if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is being co-led by Andrew and Kate. The meeting time is EARLY at 6:30 in Lincoln. We will have only about 9 hours of daylight and since the sunrise is around 7 AM, this is as late as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route I am proposing is via Black Mountain, which is right next to Loon mountain. We may get to use some XC ski trails for a bit on the way up, then encounter pretty open hardwoods for a while. There will likely be a herd path as we approach and pass Black Mtn, then the real bushwhack starts at the same place where it would be for the more common ski trail route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required gear is as follows: full winter gear including snowshoes and traction. Several extra pairs of gloves will be needed. Dress very warmly, as the speed we will be moving at makes it hard to stay warm. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you do not have winter hiking experience on 4000 ft mountains, this is most likely not a good trip for you to go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email with any questions before signing up, as I am expecting all who go on the trip to either have the experience already OR just simply explain what you are expecting to see and the gear you will bring and ask what may be missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew B</member_name><member_id>4803051</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate K </member_name><member_id>9984045</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323648818000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320287569000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scar Ridge (West) 3774'   NEHH Bushwhack (Advanced)</name><id>39750992</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323516600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/39750992/</event_url></item>
