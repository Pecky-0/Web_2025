Come on out and join us Saturday for some fun, laid back, frisbee.  Weâ€™ll be on the Boston Common at the softball fields. No dudes allowed. Not even if you wear a skirt and a wig, Joe, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the success of the debut women's game, we're going to make this a monthly recurring event. And as demand pents up, we may increase the number of games per month. So...tell your friends! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the game plan:&lt;br /&gt;11:00 - Toss the disc around, meet folks, be merry&lt;br /&gt;11:15 - Overview of the rules, safety, etc - then divide into teams&lt;br /&gt;11:30- Play!!!!!! &lt;br /&gt;1:00 - Conclude the meetup with food and socializing&lt;br /&gt;Here's what we humbly ask of you (works great as a checklist):&lt;br /&gt;Arrive on time to be guaranteed a spot in a game (RSVP is optional - but helpful for us)&lt;br /&gt;Bring LOTS OF WATER!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, cleats are not allowed on the Boston Common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, we will supply the frisbees, cones, first aid supplies (hopefully will never be used) and our pretty smiles. As we periodically mention, all these supplies are paid out-of-pocket by your loving Frisbee organizers and everyone has been so generous with their donations to-date. Thank you and let's keep the dream alive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan and Kate&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>"See the About &gt; Boston Common page for map and directions"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>461418</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katherine England</member_name><member_id>10147877</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275756366000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274479206000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Women Only: Saturday Daytime Ultimate @ Boston Common</name><id>13556616</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275750000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/13556616/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/b/2/global_14542274.jpeg</photo_url></item>
