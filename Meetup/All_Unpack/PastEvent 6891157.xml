Read Further down for the party details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd and 4th Monday meetings to practice Mandarin conversation. Learners of all levels, and native speakers welcome!&lt;br /&gt;This is an opportunity to meet with other learners and practice whatever you'd like to work on. Bring any books or homework you would like to review, and ask a native speaker to help you with pronounciation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be 5th floor.  the event location for this location won't let us edit it to say the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the below information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is the new year, we will celebrate with food and drinks. Please bring something to share with the group. If possible, say what type of food you will be bringing next to your name (Using Comment box) Ie: main dish, drinks (alcohoic or non), appetizer, dessert or snacks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will not go out to eat tonight, instead we will have dinner at BCNC, so people bring food and drinks to share.  If no time to cook or buy something in advance, there are many restaurants (to get take out) and the 88 Supermarket are nearby.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic will be: What did you do for the Holidays...If you don't celebrate any Holiday around this time say what you did recently. What are your traditions?  Did you go away? Please prepare a 2-5 minute speech, in Chinese, if possible to share with the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can all make it. We want to party and have fun and ring in the new year with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: (a member says that Mapquest directions are confusing)&lt;br /&gt;BCNC is at 38 Ash St., off of Oak St. between Washington St. and Harrison Ave.&lt;br /&gt;Oak St. is between Kneeland St. and Marginal Way (alongside the Turnpike)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest T stop is Orange Line New England Medical Center. &lt;br /&gt;Walk toward the South End (away from Chinatown) on Washington St and take the first left onto Oak St. The entrance to the building is in Ash St., the first small street on the left.
