<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&amp;quot;The Art and Design of Websites&amp;quot; will be the next Boston Digital Arts roundtable discussion at Wheeler's Cafe (near Symphony in downtown Boston), Wednesday December 2nd at 7:15 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin with time for introductions and networking, and will talk about the artistic aspects of the web medium. How has the artistry of website design evolved? How is web design being recognized? What can we expect for the future of web design?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a list of websites that inspire you. We will share links to take back home with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designers and non-designers are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Those who RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; by 11/28 and attend will receive a free packet from the organizer's web design courses. This will summarize graphic design principals that apply to website design, list common web design mistakes, include web design tips for print artists, and show an overview of current styles with screen captures ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, please remember to update your RSVP if your plans change, to be considerate of other members who may want to attend. Thanks and I look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259972804000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257531405000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Event: The Art of Web Design</name><id>11812906</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259799300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/11812906/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
