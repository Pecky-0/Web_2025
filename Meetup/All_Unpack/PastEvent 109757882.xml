&lt;p&gt;About the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marko is in his mid-thirties, has just published his first book, and has been living in Berlin since his university days – far enough away from his parents Gitte and Günter with their bourgeois lifestyle that he could never quite get used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He visits them once or twice a year, mainly to give them a chance to spend a few days with their grandson. His hopes of spending a quiet weekend with his family fall short when Gitte, who has been mentally unstable since Marko was a child, announces that she has stopped taking her medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an ensemble of top-class actors, director Hans-Christian Schmid shows in &lt;span&gt;Home for the Weekend&lt;/span&gt; how in just a few days families can fall apart and find each other again. After his award-winning films &lt;span&gt;Requiem&lt;/span&gt; (2006) and &lt;span&gt;Storm&lt;/span&gt; (2009), this is his third collaboration with the screenwriter Bernd Lange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa&lt;/p&gt;
