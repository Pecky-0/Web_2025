I'm bringing three ropes, and plan on setting up one in the 5.6 to 5.8 range, one in the 5.8 to 5.10 range, and the third somewhere else.  :)  I'm hoping someone else can bring more ropes, etc?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't be getting down there until after 1pm, so I'm planning on staying as long as I can into the evening.  If you plan to stay late with us, bring a jacket!  It gets chilly when the sun starts going down and the wind picks up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more people who have their personal gear, the better.  If you have extra harnesses/shoes, please bring those as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven't been to the quarries yet: it's fine climbing, with lots of slabby routes.  Plenty of variety overall, and lots of fun.  Also, it's really close to Boston.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be around the pond, or by the buttress</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209402422000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Summer is here, and rock is outside.
