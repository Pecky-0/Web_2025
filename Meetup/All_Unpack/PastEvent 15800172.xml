Part one takes place Sunday, January 9th and part two takes place Sunday, January 16th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find your inner abstract artist. Kim Abraham will lead an abstract drawing and painting workshop. You can sign up for either one or for both. Cost for one workshop is $15. Cost for both workshops is $25.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abstract Art Explosion Returns - Part 2. This workshop is based on the abstract art workshop presented at this year's retreat except with new materials and techniques for those who already participated. Explore abstract art through color and form. Abstract painting on yupo paper and wood will be taught. Use interesting materials to create texture and form. Go home with a multi-media abstract painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part One was very exciting, now let's take it to the next level!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part Two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be making multi-media, textured, collaged abstract artwork. I will teach two acrylic paint techniques. We will be making mono-type prints. One uses black gesso and tin foil. The other uses fluid acrylic paint on glass. I will also teach how to create texture with glass bead medium and fiber paste. You will have a small sample of glass bead medium and fiber paste to take home and practice with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a lunch or snack because we will take a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring some basic tools:&lt;br /&gt;1.Artwork from part one (if you have, if not, don't worry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Scissors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Glue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Ruler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.Pencil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.Colored pencils, especially white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All other supplies provided. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim</member_name><member_id>10816488</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295289856000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293043801000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Abstract Art Explosion Returns - Part 2</name><id>15800172</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295197200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/15800172/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/b/global_19441659.jpeg</photo_url></item>
