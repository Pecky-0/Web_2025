Saturday night is karaoke. Sing some songs or just watch while others do their thing. You can rock out with me while i jam to some Livin On A Prayer, lol. Also while you're at JD's grab a bite of their awesome pizza. I had their greek pizza, really really good. JD's is located on queen street next door to Taco Bell near exit 32 on 84. So come down have some laughs, jam to some good songs, and if you got the guts to sing then do your thing. See you at JD's Saturday June 25 @ 10.....
