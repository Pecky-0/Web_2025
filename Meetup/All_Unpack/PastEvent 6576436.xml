NOT-ME! IS A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROVIDING INSTRUCTION, CONDITIONING, AND TRAINING TO INDIVIDUALS IN AT-RISK POPULATIONS. 

Our primary objective is to help at-risk individuals survive violent attacks and deter aggressive confrontations. The majority of students are people in groups that are traditionally considered vulnerable or have been historically targeted for violence. These groups include but are not limited to people with physical disabilities, women, the gay and lesbian population, and racial minorities.

We will conduct a condensed 30 minute summery of the Not-Me! self-defense course.
