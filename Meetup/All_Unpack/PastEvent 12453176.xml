But itâ€™s the guests who are surprised when gunshots are fired and the doors are blocked. There is no way out until the family honor has been restored and the killer captured. Enjoy an interactive murder mystery, a delicious meal and great live music.&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dinner &amp;amp; Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performances take place in the renowned &lt;b&gt;Emerald Room&lt;/b&gt;. Doors open at 7:00pm. Lavish Buffet Dinner and Live Performance.&lt;br /&gt;$56.90 per person includes $45 for the ticket plus $11.90 for tax and administrative fee.  This does not include gratuity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;  Each table holds 8 guests.  In order for all of us to sit together, I have to make the reservation which means I have to pay up front.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please send a &lt;b&gt;check or money order&lt;/b&gt; for&lt;b&gt; $56.90&lt;/b&gt; payable to &lt;b&gt;Sharon Christensen&lt;/b&gt; at &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PO BOX 2795, Hyannis MA 02601&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;BEFORE&lt;/b&gt;  the deadline date of&lt;b&gt; February 17, 2010&lt;/b&gt; in order to hold your reservation.  Even if you reserve for this Meetup, if I don't have your payment by February 17th, I can't buy a ticket for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to limit the Meetup, for now, to 8, but if more than 8 ladies are interested and you want to reserve after 8 have signed up, put your name on the wait list. If we get enough for a second table, I'll increase the Meetup size to 16!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet me in the Emerald Room!
