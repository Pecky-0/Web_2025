Brown uses his wit and insight to tell a contemporary story of a relationship between a writer and an actress falling in and out of love and told from both points of view.  Contains some strong language and situations; intended for mature audiences.  &lt;br /&gt;Directed by Kyle Fabel &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In Lobby at 7:45, or at Dinner. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ira Wettenstein</member_name><member_id>5032313</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277089338000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275576299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Ira-  "The Last Five Years "  A FUN FILLED EVENING OF CULTURE AND DINING </name><id>13684126</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276992000000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/13684126/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/8/global_2930168.jpeg</photo_url></item>
