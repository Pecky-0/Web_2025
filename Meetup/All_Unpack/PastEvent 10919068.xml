We'll be listening to a talk by Andrea Fella, teacher at the Insight Meditation Center in California. In her talk, she discusses how, by watching our experience closely, we can learn how conditioned thinking and beliefs inform our worldview. This is one of the best explanations of mindfulness I have heard in a long while, I think you'll enjoy it. We will also have time for group discussion and a short meditation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us in spiritual community as we explore how the power of wisdom can help us gain clarity and presence in our lives. All levels of experience are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TomC, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting people at the door until about 6:05pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251153461000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248131174000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup: Wisdom Teachings</name><id>10919068</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250546400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/10919068/</event_url></item>
