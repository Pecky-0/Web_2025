As you might expect, there is always time for open Q&amp;amp;A. But we're also trying out a meeting format that encourages those in attendance to share their DotNetNuke expertise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The meeting opens with group presentations. Anyone at the meeting is encouraged to present a ten minute overview on any topic that is DotNetNuke related. At the end of the meeting, we vote on the presentation that we would like to hear more about at the next meeting, at which time the chosen presentation becomes the main topic for that meeting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Last month we had an excellent presentation from a member on how they are using SQL Server Reporting Services to deliver formatted reports through SQLView Pro and Microsoft Report Builder 3.0. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This month, the main talk is a "deep dive" into a DNN site that will review such topics as CSS skinning, streaming video via Amazon EC2, custom module development, jQuery for UI, and consuming a web service to generate ad hoc pdf's.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Swanzey</member_name><member_id>2473211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299683344000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>DotNetNuke Users</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DNNBoston</urlname><id>1372592</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>DotNetNuke Boston Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277070564000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DotNetNuke Boston User Group</name><id>pmgwnypfblb</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299627000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DNNBoston/events/16463757/</event_url></item>
