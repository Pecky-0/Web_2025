A portion of the beach to the left of the westernmost (town of Ipswich) boardwalk has been designated as an area where dogs can run free without bothering other visitors. A one-day Green Dogs pass may be purchased at the Crane Beach front gate for $3.00 per dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds as though we should meet near the main front gate, but I don't know how far it is from there to the place where our "Green" Cavaliers can have their romp safely. If anyone has been to Crane Beach before can advise us about this, please do so! Neither Ron nor I have been to this beautiful place before. &lt;br /&gt;

 Rain or stormy weather will cancel this meetup.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karla Rab</member_name><member_id>10717717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351562686000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349401223000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Go for a romp at Crane Beach, Ipswich!</name><id>85586972</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351357200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/85586972/</event_url></item>
