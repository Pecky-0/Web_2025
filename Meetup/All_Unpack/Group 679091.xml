&lt;br&gt;

 Friend/colleague: "So what are you up to tonight?"&lt;br&gt;

 You: "I'm headed over to [The Middle East/Brighton Music Hall/Great Scott] for a show tonight."&lt;br&gt;

 Friend/colleague: "Oh. One of those bands you listen to. Who is it, Nervous Squirrel again?"&lt;br&gt;

 You: "That was Frightened Rabbit. And no, I'm going to see [insert name of awesome indie band]."&lt;br&gt;

Friend/colleague: Blank stare.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

If so, you're in the right place.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

This group is for people who don't have a lot of friends who frequent indie rock &amp;ndash; as you'll see from the range of shows we attend, we use that term very loosely &amp;ndash; shows, who are looking to meet some avid concert-goers, or just love live music and want to see some Boston venues. Meet up for food or drinks before and after shows.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Venues that will be the most frequented:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Middle East &amp;ndash; Cambridge&lt;br&gt;

Brighton Music Hall &amp;ndash; Brighton&lt;br&gt;

Great Scott &amp;ndash; Allston&lt;br&gt;

Paradise Rock Club (and Lounge) - Boston (near BU)&lt;br&gt;

Royale &amp;ndash; Boston&lt;br&gt;

TT the Bears - Cambridge&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

This group will be an open forum for indie (and the like) shows. Rather than stick to the standard Meetup model of having a few organizers run all the events, we&amp;rsquo;d like to get everyone involved and have lots of options on the calendar. So if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on heading to a show, and you&amp;rsquo;re willing to be responsible for arranging a time and place to meet and making sure people can find you and the group when they arrive, send us a suggestion (use the big &amp;ldquo;Schedule a New Meetup&amp;rdquo; link on our page) and we&amp;rsquo;ll help you do the rest!&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.74</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1189618163000</created><lat>42.3499984741</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>264</id><urlkey>friends</urlkey><name>Friends</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1273</id><urlkey>newintown</urlkey><name>New In Town</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4422</id><urlkey>socialnetwork</urlkey><name>Social Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>8652</id><urlkey>livemusic</urlkey><name>Live Music</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10581</id><urlkey>social</urlkey><name>Social</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15018</id><urlkey>music</urlkey><name>Music</name></topics_item></topics><name>Indie Rock Boston</name><id>679091</id><members>1585</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>8828135</member_id><name>Matthew</name></organizer><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/e/e/600_4504078.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/e/e/highres_4504078.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>4504078</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/e/e/thumb_4504078.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Brighton</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/</link><lon>-71.1200027466</lon></item>
