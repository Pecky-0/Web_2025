It is the story of how one British bureaucrat’s slip of the tongue can be the catalyst for a campaign for war in the Middle East. There are scenes in secret Congressional meetings and UN hearings, but the tone is one similar to that of The Office, deadpan comedy at the expense of realistic human foibles. Mark my words, In the Loop will be a massive cult film once it hits DVD and is watched over and over again. Being on the bandwagon early is but one of the reasons why you should see the best political comedy of the decade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most amazing thing about the way the film is written and structured is that while the tone remains consistently cheeky, there are a lot of different types of comedy at work here, depending on which characters are in the scene and how they play off one another. Each character is funny in a very peculiar and particular way and everyone will have a different favorite and the joy is watching them interact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ifcfilms.com/videos/in-the-loop-trailer" target="_blank"&gt;Watch In The Loop Official Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106141579" target="_blank"&gt;NPR's All Things Considered talks about In The Loop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252454081000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250275790000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>In The Loop</name><id>11112969</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252018800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/11112969/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
