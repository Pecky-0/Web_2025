Mark Simonoff, Legal adviser to U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, will join the New Hampshire Institute of Politics &amp;amp; Political Library at Saint Anselm College to discuss, Diplomacy at the United Nations: Tackling the Most Important Issues in the World Today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the United States has worked to re-invigorate its relationship with the United Nations, citing its importance as the only forum where every country comes together to address a wide range of pressing world issues. Simonoff will provide an overview of the principal organs of the United Nations, including the UN Security Council, charged with the maintenance of international peace and security, and will discuss current issues on the UN's agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from Simonoffâ€™s role as Legal Adviser to US Ambassador Susan Rice and as the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations since August of 2008, Simonoff worked in the Office of the Legal Adviser at the US Department of State, handling Antarctic, Arctic, oceans, outer space and environmental issues, among others. Simonoff also worked as a litigator in private and government practice for several years in Boston, and clerked for judges at the US District Court and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. He received his law degree from Harvard Law School, and his undergraduate degree from Yale College.&lt;/p&gt;
