Come join us! The runners will pass us after the 2 mile mark and again after 11 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff ; font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mylesstandishmarathon.com/index.html"&gt;Myles Standish Marathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Marathon Relay will start at 8:00 at College Pond in Myles Standish State Forest. The course passes through many sections of the forest, finishing out of the forest at the Shops @ 5 on Long Pond Road in Plymouth. (The basic course starts at College Pond, runs down to Charge Pond, back over to the headquarters, up Lower College Pond to Bare Hill Road and on to and around the Billington Sea and Morton Park before crossing Drew Road to the finish at the Shops at Five on Long Pond Road.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/100277251"&gt;A link to the course map&lt;/a&gt; showing mile by mile marks and turns is provided at the website linked above.)&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/2/c/event_170233612.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race is sponsored by the Bayside Runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #cc33cc ; font-size : x-small"&gt;A portion of race proceeds will be donated to the Plymouth Area Coalition Food Pantry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers are needed at water stations and to act as course spotters at various points along the route.  Some volunteers are needed very early in the day. Others will not be needed until well after the 8:00AM start. Some volunteer jobs are short duration (at the 1 mile mark.) Others go on for three or four hours (closer to the finish).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers have announced that all runners will be shuttled from the Shops at Five, so runners will not be parking directly at College Pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of events bring hundreds of people into the forest who may never have visited. It is an opportunity to make them aware of our organization and perhaps interest them in some of the many things we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to know if any of our members are running or have friends/neighbors/relatives planning to run so we can look for them. Let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
