More organized? Find balance between work and everything else that matters to you? &lt;strong&gt;Join Socializing for Justice for a Skillshare on Value-Based Time Management on February 4, 6:00 - 8:30 PM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoJust hosts events that draw progressives of all stripes that share common values but may work on different issues. We host monthly socials that allow for the possibility of cross-issue connections and run a monthly Skillshare Series, hosted by The NonProfit Center*, which increases our individual capacity for movement building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHEDULE  &lt;br /&gt;

 6:00-6:30 Socializing -  &lt;strong&gt;bring your own dinner&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 6:30-8:30 Training and Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value-Based Time Management&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 This workshop begins with a discussion of how time should be viewed and valued; why one needs to manage it; and how successful people tend to view and use time. Then we move onto the five foundational principles of time management, and contrast examples of managed and unmanaged time schedules. We then discuss right and wrong ways to use time, lifestyles that support and inhibit success, and techniques for budgeting and tracking your time. We also discuss how to set priorities; how to decide and maintain boundaries; and how to “create” time through delegation and other techniques. Finally, we discuss tips for sticking to your schedule, and dealing with unsupportive people. After the workshop, many participants report being more productive and less stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Socializing for Justice - www.sojust.org&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 2200 members and 6+ years of creating a diverse cross-issue community in Boston (140+ events!), Socializing for Justice is the best place to find the great people, organizations and community you're looking for while putting the SOCIAL back in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/strong&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
