&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a poll for the July book and you guys chose American Gods by Neil Gaiman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Amazon synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Released from prison, Shadow finds his world turned upside down. His wife has been killed; a mysterious stranger offers him a job. But Mr. Wednesday, who knows more about Shadow than is possible, warns that a storm is coming -- a battle for the very soul of America . . . and they are in its direct path.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!   &lt;br /&gt;

 -Josh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Oh my, 31 respondents! I had to cap the responses because Comicazi cannot handle much more people than this. I set up a waiting list for those that would like to respond late.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the back of the store.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>9704391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342305622000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339688600000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>July Book Club Meeting</name><id>69161132</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342135800000</time><rsvp_limit>31</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/69161132/</event_url></item>
