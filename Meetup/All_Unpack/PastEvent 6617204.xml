Wish you all have a great family holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a day to remind me to be grateful. Hundred years ago people shared food and took care each other so that we have this holiday. We can continue this spirit! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's meeting, we can share more about How to practice postive thinking and to be grateful and how do we practice in our daily life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to welcome all the friends with peaceful mind to join the discussion and sharing! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to meet more friends with the same interest about seeking a spiritual life, please come and share your thoughts and experiences about how to practice spirituality in daily life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jonathan</member_name><member_id>4981726</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195585388000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spirituality-149</urlname><id>670379</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5999984741</group_lon><name>The Westborough Spirituality Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193349697000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Westborough Spirituality November meetup</name><id>6617204</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195412400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spirituality-149/events/6617204/</event_url></item>
