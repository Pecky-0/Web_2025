Rescuing the Constitution: The Destructive Effects of Progressivism What were the people of the early 20th century attempting to remedy by approving the Progressive led &lt;br /&gt;

assault upon the Framers' Constitution? What were they thinking when they voted to ratify &lt;br /&gt;

the 16th Amendment and the 17th Amendment to radically alter &lt;br /&gt;

the Framers' Plan of Government? &lt;br /&gt;

Featured Topics &amp;amp; Speakers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Honorable Dan Itse: &lt;br /&gt;

Can administrative agency rules lawfully enjoy the full force and effect of law when &lt;br /&gt;

a State Constitution specifically vests the supreme legislative power in a Senate and House of Representatives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ralph Rossum: &lt;br /&gt;

James Madison, Father of the American Constitution, declared that the Constitution set up a &lt;br /&gt;

government that was neither wholly national nor wholly federal, but both. Is that still true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee Button: &lt;br /&gt;

The Ten Commandments form the basis of American Civil Law. Thus, religion is liberating and not the &lt;br /&gt;

enemy of personal liberty, as some would make it out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Edwin Vieira: &lt;br /&gt;

How does the existence of the Federal Reserve Bank fit into the Framers' plan for a limited government? &lt;br /&gt;

In whose hands does control of America's economic system really lie? Is it controlled by our &lt;br /&gt;

national government or is it controlled by private hands?&lt;/p&gt;
