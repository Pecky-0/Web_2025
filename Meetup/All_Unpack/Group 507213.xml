The group originally ran with two branches: Cambridge and Brookline, and our goal is to provide similar groupings in and around the Boston area.  Organization has changed hands over the past two years, but the result has always been a source of good conversation, new acquaintances, and exposure to books and genres that provide both comfort and exploration.  

So, if you're into reading, talking, and often eating (yay, eating!), you are even remotely close to the Boston area, and are the ages of 20-30ish, this is the group for you.</description><rating>4.54</rating><join_mode>approval</join_mode><created>1179761947000</created><lat>42.2900009155</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>264</id><urlkey>friends</urlkey><name>Friends</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>713</id><urlkey>diningout</urlkey><name>Dining Out</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2767</id><urlkey>bookclub</urlkey><name>Book Club</name></topics_item></topics><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name><id>507213</id><members>1961</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>12400154</member_id><name>Paras Hezar</name></organizer><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/3/e/600_1450046.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/3/e/highres_1450046.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>1450046</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/3/e/thumb_1450046.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/</link><lon>-71.0500030518</lon></item>
