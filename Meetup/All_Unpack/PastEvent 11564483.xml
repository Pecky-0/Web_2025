Turn left here; this is Hunting Road. Proceed roughly 0.6 miles to another stop light, the first one youâ€™ll come to after making the left onto Hunting Road, and turn left again.  This is (take our word for it) Kendrick Street, though we offer a prize for the first of you to spot a road sign saying so. Continue about&lt;br /&gt;0.3 miles on Kendrick, over Route 128/95, to Cutler Park on the right. It's prominently marked and features a capacious parking area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking lot and leave/return from there</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255958554000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254858800000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Road Ride- Meet at Cutler Park Needham/Dedham</name><id>11564483</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255784400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/11564483/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/2/global_1776498.jpeg</photo_url></item>
