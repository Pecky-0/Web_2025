&lt;p&gt;Please arrive in time to be in your kayak and ready to paddle by 7:00 PM.  It will already be dark at 7:00 (sunset @ 5:45), so keep that in mind as you will need to unload and load your kayak in the dark.  Moonrise (not full, but close enough) is at 4:01 so it will be above the trees by the time we are heading out.  If the forecast is for cloudy weather I will most likely cancel, so check your email before heading over.  I will decide by Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have a whistle, a headlamp or flashlight and wear a properly fastened PFD. Although not required by law, it is a good idea to have a pump and paddle float with you.   The water is starting to get cold and a wetsuit or drysuit is recommended, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The parking and launch is on Route 135 between Hopkinton and Westborough centers, approx 42.24166 North and -71.57316 West.  Do not program "Whitehall State Park" into your GPS. That will not take you to the launch site.  The nearest side road is Dale Road in Hopkinton, just west of the parking lot entrance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PLEASE NOTE - The organizers in this group are NOT trained leaders or instructors.  The organizers only set the time and place, each person participating in any group trip is responsible for their own safety.  Each participant is responsible for evaluating all relevant conditions for the trip and determining if their skills and equipment are appropriate for those conditions.)&lt;/p&gt;
