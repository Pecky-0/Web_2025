&lt;p&gt;Ivan will be raffling off a Kindle Fire and a SkySQL HA review at the December meeting.&amp;nbsp; Must be present to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan Zoratti, VP of Professional Services for SkySQL, will talk about "MySQL HA reloaded - old tricks and cool new tools to guarantee high availability to your MySQL Servers"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think that High Availability is all about MySQL Replication? Have you tried to alter your tables to NDB to drink at the holy grail of the shared nothing architectures? High Availability is #1 request for MySQL Servers, even more popular than scalability and performance. In this presentation we will talk about old and new tools to provide HA, automatic failover and disaster recovery for MySQL - there is a solution for every need.&lt;/p&gt;
