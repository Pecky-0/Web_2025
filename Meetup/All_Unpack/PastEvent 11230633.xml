In addition to any clothing designers, we welcome those who  have wardrobe consulting businesses and are interested in adding  the potential of working with designers in various categories. Letâ€™s have another productive meetup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those designers who have a product to show, please bring a sample to help others as well as yourselves in explaining how and why you designed the way you did for your target consumer, and how you are intending to reach your specific consumer market. There are a couple who have already replied. RSVP and join us. Remember, only ten can RSVP. We like small groups for achieving results. Please continue to bring any production or pattern questions that you may have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email me if you want specific directions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes, &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley, Organizer of BDL &lt;br /&gt;Assistant organizer of Boston Fashion Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Email Shirley for directions</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1252517201000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251548052000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Design Lab Continues Designing &amp; Selling Discussions</name><id>11230633</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252159200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/11230633/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/a/global_7779386.jpeg</photo_url></item>
