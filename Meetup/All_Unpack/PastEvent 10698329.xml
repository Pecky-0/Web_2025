And Somerville's Sabur restaurant, located close to Davis Square, is one of the best places in the greater Boston area to try them. Let's try getting together on a week night after work and see if we can get enough interested people to taste every meze on the menu!  If we're lucky, we'll be able to snag an outside table and do this al fresco. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabur's wine list usually has some interesting and affordable choices from Greece/Croatia/Macedonia, so we should be able to taste some delightfully different drinks in addition to food. Just as people often do with tapas, it is possible to make a complete meal out of meze. . . we can stay into the dinner hours and try this or just make it an early-evening rendezvous, as the group prefers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your $2 reservation fee will be added to the tip for our party.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Weather permitting, look for me and a Meetup sign at an outside table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248559006000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245546463000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Midweek Meze at Sabur</name><id>10698329</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247695200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/10698329/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/4/global_9254596.jpeg</photo_url></item>
