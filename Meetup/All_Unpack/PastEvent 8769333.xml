The philosophy of yoga includes concepts of loving-kindness, compassion for others as well as for one self, our connection to all.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The physical exercise of yoga is to quiet the mind, by being in the present moment Yoga is meditation in motion. Yoga practice can also lead to a seated meditation&lt;br /&gt;(mindfulness).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yoga reduces stress, helps us to focus, stretches our muscles, and massages our internal organs. Our energy centers are a natural part of this practice, with the breath central to focus.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This presentation will include an introduction to yoga philosophy.  It will include yoga for stress reduction with use of breath, poses to quiet and open ourselves. Poses that may assist anxiety and depression will be demonstrated.  For those who would like to participate in some of the exercises (asana) please wear lose clothing (and don’t eat too much at lunch).  If you have a yoga mat—please bring it (if not—that is alright too).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ann Vasey, M.Ed. is a registered yoga teacher (200 hour), and has practiced yoga for 30 years.
