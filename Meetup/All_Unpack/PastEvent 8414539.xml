We will be having the event in an old historic theater located in downtown Rochester, NH, it is under renovations but will be ready for our party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theater is called the &amp;quot;Scenic Theater&amp;quot;, and it can hold about 900 people, so its fairly large. This game is not a board game; everyone will be participating at the same time; you must not be afraid of the dark, and you must dress all in black clothing! This is not a show. The downstairs floor is somewhat inclined so wear sneakers or comfortable walking shoes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be having a potluck before the game so bring something special. We will meet at 6 pm to socialize at which time I will explain the game and give a brief tour of the building then at 7pm the mystery will start. This is not a child event so please do not bring your children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipate we will have a fairly large amount of people coming so I will be limiting the number of people for this event to 50. I may be combining this with some other meetup groups. After the party we can go dancing at Slim's Tex Mex restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details will follow as we get closer to the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a free event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions call me at 603-509-2907. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there for a wonderful special night! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy in the black cape.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221516787000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217069569000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trailblazers Event: Murder Mystery Party </name><id>8414539</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221343200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/8414539/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/d/global_4922573.jpeg</photo_url></item>
