It should be a very nice introduction to many of the basic concepts in the Course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a well-known teacher of A Course in Miracles.  He holds these seminars once a month between presentations that he does all over the world.  He has a nice website and is responsible for Miracles Magazine, &lt;a href="http://www.miraclesmagazine.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.miraclesma...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 2 hours to get to Middletown from my house so we will be leaving at 10:00 to be sure to get there on time and have a chance to have a bite to eat and stretch our legs before the seminar.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to join us, please call me so we can get an idea of how many are going.  Best to try my cell, (860) 338-3922.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Jon Mundy.
