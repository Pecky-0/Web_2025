<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>As something new, we will try a chat follow-up of today's meetup about Flaubert's Madame Bovary. This has been suggested by one of our members, Perkins. This may be of interest to you if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- you read the book but couldn't attend the meeting&lt;br /&gt;- live further away&lt;br /&gt;- attended the meetup but more things came to mind after the meeting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, let's try this as an experiment, and see how it goes. If there is an interest for this, and we find that the discussion can work out in a chat forum, we will do this again with other books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP as if this was a regular in-the-flesh meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;- Go to www.mirc.com and download the chat program&lt;br /&gt;- Click the button labeled &amp;quot;join&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;- There should be a list of chat rooms - click on #classicbooks&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>sivert</member_name><member_id>2371042</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248042250000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246253836000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Madame Bovary - Chat Discussion</name><id>10758056</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246831200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/10758056/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
