The Starbucks is right next to a Chinese restaurant called the Golden Temple. I (Cathy) will try to find a place outside and sit with a book on the table so you can find me. I'll try to get there early to save a few tables, but seating might be a stretch. We'll be meeting to discuss what kind of books we'll be reading, any literary or non-literary activities we'll participate it, and in general just to get to know each other over a warm, refreshing cup of $70 coffee. So let's rock this mother!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cathy</member_name><member_id>4263429</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185318389000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184689838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brookline Meetup</name><id>6036354</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185145200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/6036354/</event_url></item>
