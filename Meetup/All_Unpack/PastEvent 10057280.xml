The only avenue we have had for change has been the appeals court. Had it not been for the appeals court we would not have won the right to an evidentiary hearing in 2005 to defend ourselves against false allegations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Judge Hanlon is appointed to the appeals court she will block the only legal avenue we have for progress and an important defense against false allegations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important that every one arrive at 10:00AM so that we are certain to be seated. Please rendezvous with Joe Ureneck who will be at the Governor' office and will be wearing a badge that says &amp;quot;Vote No on Hanlon.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In preparation for opposing Judge Hanlon there is a conference call on Tuesday evening March 31 at 9:00PM. Please join us then. For conference call credentials please call Joe at 857 350-0575 or by email: jureneck@comcast.net.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joseph Ureneck</member_name><member_id>8050884</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240265158000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fathers' Rights Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Greater-Boston-Chapter-of-The-Fatherhood-Coalition</urlname><id>1412531</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Chapter of The Fatherhood Coalition</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238266942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Urgent Opposition to Appeals Court Judge Appointment</name><id>10057280</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238594400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Chapter-of-The-Fatherhood-Coalition/events/10057280/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/b/global_7743227.jpeg</photo_url></item>
