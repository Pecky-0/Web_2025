These Asylums were laundries where supposedly “fallen” young women would be rehabilitated. Many of these young women would spend the rest of their lives there. These were places of horrendous physical and psychological abuse, and inhumane living conditions. The last of the “Magdalene Laundries,” as they came to be called, closed in 1996. This movie painfully depicts the plight of four young women in one of these institutions and how they suffered at the hands of the nuns who had lost their love for humanity and colluded in the horrible treatment of the girls. This movie will open your eyes to how advocating for children and young people who have no voice in society is essential, and that we need to speak up on their behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhXKI9tAI_M" target="_blank"&gt;Click here to view the trailer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our September Conscious Movie supports&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.icfaid.org/default.asp" target="_blank"&gt;International Children’s Fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people and support a worthy cause!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
