By visiting each winery, you can earn a stamp on a booklet that you then mail in (or turn in to a winery) to earn a chance to win a cruise, a getaway to the cape, or free wine! More details here: &lt;a href="http://coastalwinetrail.com/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;http://coastalwinetra...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For today's meetup, we're going to visit Newport Vineyards in Middletown, RI, and Greenvale Vineyards in Portsmouth, RI. We'll follow our wine tasting with a late lunch at Fieldstones in Portsmouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newport Vineyards has daily tours at 1pm, so let's meet in the store at 12:45. &lt;br /&gt;Here is Newport Vineyards' website: &lt;a href="http://www.newportvineyards.com/default.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newportvin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't say on their website but I think the tour + tasting is $10 (incl. wine glass).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll then head 5 min away to Greenvale Vineyards, which has daily tours at 2pm.&lt;br /&gt;Here is Greenvale's website: &lt;a href="http://www.greenvale.com/home2.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenvale....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tours + tastings are $9 and include the wine glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we'll drive about 10 min to Fieldstones: &lt;a href="http://www.atlanticgrille.net/fs/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.atlanticgr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It'll be a fun afternoon! :) Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;This event is cross-listed with WINGS.
