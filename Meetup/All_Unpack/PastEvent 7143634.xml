The story chronicles the life and times of one Daniel Plainview (Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis), who transforms himself from a down-and-out silver miner raising a son on his own into a self-made oil tycoon. When Plainview gets a mysterious tip-off that there's a little town out West where an ocean of oil is oozing out of the ground, he heads with his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), to take their chances in dust-worn Little Boston. In this hardscrabble town, where the main excitement centers around the holy roller church of charismatic preacher Eli Sunday (Little Miss Sunshine's Paul Dano), Plainview and H.W. make their lucky strike. But even as the well raises all of their fortunes, nothing will remain the same as conflicts escalate and every human value - love, hope, community, belief, ambition and even the bond between father and son - is imperiled by corruption, deception and the flow of oil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dir. Paul Thomas Anderson, w/ Daniel Day Lewis, Paul Dano, Ciaran Hands, Kevin J. O'Connor, and Dillon Freasier, 2h38m&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots to digest about this film, so plan to join us afterward at a local eatery for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup assumes that the film will be playing at the Coolidge at the stated time.  I will send an email during the week to confirm the showing and start time as well as a link to pre-purchase tickets - always a good idea at the Coolidge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, strongly consider getting a membership at the Coolidge.  Saves money, helps the theater, gets you free popcorn - heck, it's like discovering oil!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will conduct the usual drill at the front of the theater with a meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949394000</updated><rating><average>3.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><why>People are gushing about how great this group is to see and discuss the best films.</why><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200663202000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>There Will Be Blood</name><id>7143634</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201303800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/7143634/</event_url></item>
