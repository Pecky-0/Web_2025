<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Heublin Tower is a beautiful landmark in the Hartford area.  For this hike, we will meet at Reservoir 6 and complete an 8.5 mile loop that will take us to the tower and back by the reservoir.  The tower will be a great place to break for lunch and enjoy the views from the top. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those concerned about the distance and elevation gain, there is a 3.5 version around just the reservoir that can be an option. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like us to be on the trail no later than 9:30.  Parking is somewhat limited but there is more street parking across from the lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is considered a moderate hike with a 700ft gain.  It should be do-able for many.  The trail is well traveled and marked.  Please understand though, we are not hiking the wide, groomed recreational trail.  We will be on the Metacomet Trail in the woods with rocks and mud and trees and bugs....hiking.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Please wear appropriate footwear (boots) and bring snacks or lunch and water.  I expect to be on the trail until early afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;Reservoir 6 is on Rt. 44 in West Hartford.  From Bishops Corner, travel north on Rt. 44.  You will see the sign reading Reservoir 6, Metropolitan District on your right. &lt;br /&gt;From Avon, at the junction of 44 and 10, take 44 south for 2.3 miles.  The lot will be on you left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will watch the weather closer to the date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
