Everyone is invited, not just volleyball players. You can meet us at Jenness State Beach. Please comment on what you plan to bring for food, paper goods or firewood. I will bring samores. Keilbasa, sausage, hot dogs, rolls, potato salad or pasta salad would be a good idea. (Don't forget ketchup) I have plenty of kindling, we just need plenty of firewood. Can't wait to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>9389653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284599716000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284082996000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The After Party!</name><id>14718767</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284595200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/14718767/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/c/global_2393356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
