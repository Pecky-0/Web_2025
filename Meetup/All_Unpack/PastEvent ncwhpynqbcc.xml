Within this segment, battery technology (principally defined as electro-chemical energy storage methods) has tremendous demands being placed on it by industries, utilities and policymakers focused on transportation, portable power and grid reform. The stakes for battery technology are only increasing with the relatively recent focus of the transportation industry on electric and hybrid engine power, and incumbents and new entrants are all focused on optimizing their positioning for the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The December 21st EntreTech Forum will explore the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field by bringing together a panel of local leaders on the topic. Some of the key questions to be asked include: How did the industry leaders get where they are today? How can new entrants position best themselves in this industrial ecosystem? What is the role of private funders vs. public sources of funding? What are the current market demands for Li-ion Tech? Where are the advancements going to be made (new chemistries, engineering systems, or utilization/implementation)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panelists:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. K.M.
