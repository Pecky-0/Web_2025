<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few of us heading for a biking weekend on Cape Cod on June 13 - 14.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to get the fast ferry to Province town on the Saturday morning at 9am, cycle to Eastham and stay overnight and cycle back to P town on the Sunday, spend a few hours drinking and relaxing before getting the ferry back to Boston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cycling about 20 - 25 miles each day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estimates of cost:  &lt;br /&gt;Ferry is $86 return, &lt;br /&gt;accommodation: if we stay at the hostel in Eastham it would cost about $35. But people could stay wherever they liked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rsvp if you are interested, I think accommodation likely to book out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;Amy &amp;amp; Eveline&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245369411000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243290951000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike weekend - Cape Cod - June 13 to 14</name><id>10489978</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244897100000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/10489978/</event_url></item>
