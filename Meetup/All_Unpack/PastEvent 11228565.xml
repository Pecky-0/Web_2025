I would still like to hike but earlier. By midday the trails should dry a bit. Please update your RSVP accordingly. Sorry for the change. It's in the interest of safety.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I have the urge to hike. After a morning run with Zeus, I'm sure CoCo will want to go out. Why not oblige?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing overly organized, just some play time for her. I'm thinking of something around 1.5 hours at a moderate pace with plenty of ups and downs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the late posting but I just thought about it. This all assumes the weather holds out for Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I own a green Chevy Pickup</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252335086000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251507088000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sundays Are Made for Hiking.</name><id>11228565</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251648000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/11228565/</event_url></item>
