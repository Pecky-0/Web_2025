Traditionally dinner was not served until 8:30 or 9:00 in the evening and the Duchess often became hungry, especially in the summer when dinner was served even later. She ordered a small meal of bread, butter, and other niceties, such as cakes, tarts, and biscuits, to be brought secretly to her boudoir. When she was exposed she was not ridiculed, as she had feared, but her habit caught on and the concept of a small meal, of niceties and perhaps tea, became popular and eventually known as &amp;quot;afternoon tea&amp;quot; (Ukers 1935). Obviously the origins of the well known British tradition of afternoon tea cannot be credited to only one woman, but evolved over a period of time, as many cultural customs do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh,... but there's more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the introduction of tea into Britain, the English had two main meals, breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was ale, bread, and beef.  During the middle of the eighteenth century, dinner for the upper and middle classes had shifted from noontime to an evening meal that was served at a fashionable late hour. Dinner was a long, massive meal at the end of the day. On a side note, did you know that people would often drink ale instead of water because drinking water could make people deathly ill and even cause death. Drinking ale was definitely the safer way to go because of the beer making process naturally make ale a clean and healthy alternative.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17th Century&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afternoon tea may have been started by the French. According to the monthly newsletter called TeaMuse, in the writings of Madame de Sévigné (1626 to 1696), one of history's greatest letter writers on life in 17th Century France:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a little known fact, but after its introduction to Europe in the 17th century tea was tremendously popular in France. It first arrived in Paris in 1636 (22 years before it appeared in England!) and quickly became popular among the aristocracy. . . Tea was so popular in Paris that Madame de Sévigné, who chronicled the doings of the Sun King and his cronies in a famous series of gossipy letters to her daughter, often found herself mentioning tea. &amp;quot;Saw the Princesse de Tarente [de Sévigné wrote]... who takes 12 cups of tea every day... which, she says, cures all her ills. She assured me that Monsieur de Landgrave drank 40 cups every morning. 'But Madame, perhaps it is really only 30 or so.' 'No, 40. He was dying, and it brought him back to life before our eyes.' . . . Madame de Sévigné also reported that it was a Frenchwoman, the Marquise de la Sablière, who initiated the fashion of adding milk to tea. &amp;quot;Madame de la Sablière took her tea with milk, as she told me the other day, because it was to her taste.&amp;quot; (By the way, the English delighted in this &amp;quot;French touch&amp;quot; and immediately adopted it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:&lt;br /&gt;We'll have to go back for Cafe Fleuri for their decadent Sunday Brunch and another time for their decadent chocolate bar!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afternoon Tea; 4 star decor!!! 4 Stars&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259028363000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257265180000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bond for Afternoon Tea - Sounds Splendid! </name><id>11782240</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258227900000</time><rsvp_limit>9</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11782240/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/7/4/global_11753236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
