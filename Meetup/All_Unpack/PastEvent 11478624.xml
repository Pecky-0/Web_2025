I hope at least the SAME people can come, and more!! If you never have been to a euchre meet up yet, why not?? It's on a Sat, bring your own drinks- we have water, milk, some hard  booze for making some drinks... we'll play until our hearts are content, so if it's a further drive for some of you, just know your drive will be worth it (we hope)...come along for some EUCHRE fun!! &lt;br /&gt;See you soon, Mindy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mindy</member_name><member_id>4498017</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256193949000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Euchre Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>euchre-262</urlname><id>1040200</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North of Boston Euchre Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254071496000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Euchre</name><id>11478624</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255215600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euchre-262/events/11478624/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/global_3408104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
