This should be about 13 miles round-trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who prefer a longer ride may choose to continue north from Barrington on to the Providence end of the path and back (this will add another 16 miles round trip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain will cancel the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested donation $1 for the organizer fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From I-95 North and South:   Take Route 195 East to Exit 7, Route 114, towards Barrington. Follow route 114 until it narrows to a single lane road. You will come to a stop light (there will be a white church on the left and high school field on the right). Continue through this light straight into town. You'll pass through a couple more lights and you'll eventually see a large shopping center on your right (look for a Talbot's, Staples, and Shaws Supermarket).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike trail runs along the side of the shopping center parking lot. Park in a spot near the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please consider carpooling. Add a comment to your rsvp offering or asking for a ride and saying where you could meet. Offer gas money to the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dot.state" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.dot.state&lt;/a&gt;....   Total Bike Path Length: 14.5 miles of paved bike path with connection to 3 miles of paved path in   Colt State Park in Bristol.   Grade: Predominately flat with one steep hill in East Providence. Path exposed to   Narragansett Bay on upper and lower stretches, making for occasional stiff head winds.   Trail condition: Good to average. This is the state's oldest major bike path. A long   section in Barrington was resurfaced in 2001. Narrower than most newer bike paths.   Special characteristics: This path provides a vision for all other bike paths in   Rhode Island, connecting five communities. Terrain is very diverse from city to urban   waterfront to bayfront to forested areas to neighborhoods and villages centers.   Natural attractions nearby: Boating and fishing in Narragansett Bay. Passive   recreation in Colt State Park. Wildlife viewing at Audubon Society of Rhode Island   Education Center in Bristol, with long boardwalk bisecting the path.   Historical attractions nearby: Historic homes and shopping districts in East   side of Providence, Warren center, Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park behind Staples in the spots along the bike trail.
