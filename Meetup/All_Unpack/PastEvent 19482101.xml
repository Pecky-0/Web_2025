But we had to change the time. It was the only way they could accomodate all of us since it took us so long. Not anyones fault. Just a PIA. - So our Zip is at 330 but we can meet at 2-230 to hang out and that gives us some leeway just in case anyone gets lost or has to take a lot of potty breaks on the way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we zip our asses off we will go for dinner and drinks at the Warfield House which is about a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but here is the website - there are 3 levels of Zips... the kiddy, the intermediate and the valley tour that goes from mountain top to mountain top. One of the runs is over&amp;nbsp; 2000 feet long and about&amp;nbsp;185 feet high. But you can go on whichever one you like. I will work out the logistics soon but be prepared to prepay if you want to go. Columbus day weekend will be a crowded time and we will ahve to reserve the spots early.&lt;/p&gt;
