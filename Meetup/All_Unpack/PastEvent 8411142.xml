Concerts begin at 6:30p.m.&lt;br /&gt;It makes no difference what kind of music you are into or what your age, when you see and hear The Memories, you will not soon forget them. Their harmonies and musical talent are unmatched as far as the music of the Golden Era of Rock &amp;amp; Roll is concerned. So - sit back, relax, and have a nice trip down memory lane. Remember, Rock &amp;amp; Roll is here to stay and The Memories are here to make sure it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.memoriesband.com/home.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.memoriesba...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll arrive at 6:00 to reserve a table or two.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219065558000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217011703000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Outdoor Concert - The Memories</name><id>8411142</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217628000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/8411142/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
