We will be dancing and socializing, so come out and have some fun! Please bring a potluck dinner from that time era. If you know of any good music let me know or bring some music that you would like to play. If you have any questions my number is 603-509-2907.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking it would be fun (have done this at parties &lt;br /&gt;before) if everyone brought a pict of themselves when they were &lt;br /&gt;a kid and everyone try to guess who is who. It can be funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a table or chair if you have one. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be joined by the Trailblazers meetup group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hippie Philosophy: &lt;br /&gt;To be a hippie you must believe in peace as the way to resolve differences among peoples, ideologies and religions. The way to peace is through love and tolerance. Loving means accepting others as they are, giving them freedom to express themselves and not judging them based on appearances. This is the core of the hippie philosophy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the party!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240667777000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239048948000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hippie Party</name><id>10128991</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240095600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/10128991/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/c/b/global_8025531.jpeg</photo_url></item>
