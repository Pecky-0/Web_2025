<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's try this again!  So we had a little trouble last time.  I'm trying to be more specific this time.  The meet-up will be at Danehy Park (directions below) again at the dog run.  The dog run is to the left when you enter the park from the New Street entrance.  There are maps all over the park that should help if you come from a different entrance.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed the meet-up time to 1:30.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is potential that the weather wil be bad.  I know some Frenchies aren't too fond of the cold and rain and given that that pretty much describes winter around here it seems like a good idea to have a back up plan (maybe indoors).  Any suggestions?    We can always discuss this as it gets closer to the date and we check the weather forecast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See everyone on the 17th!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Boston, take Storrow Drive/Soldiers Field Road or Memorial Drive (both can be accessed from the Cambridge exit 18 off the Mass Pike) to Fresh Pond Parkway (Rtes. 2, 3 &amp;amp; 16) towards Arlington. Follow through light at intersection of Huron Avenue and past Porter Chevrolet on right to rotary with Sozio Electronics store, through rotary and immediate right onto New Street just after Sozio, Danehy Park is ahead on right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From outside city, take Rte. 2 East from Rte. 95 (Rte. 128) to the Alewife T Station (can also take Rte. 16 from Arlington/Medford area), go past the train station and over the bridge towards Fresh Pond on Alewife Brook Parkway, go all the way around the rotary at the ground round to reverse direction, then turn right into the parking lot at the Fresh Pond Mall, go around to the left and past the cinema to New Street and Danehy Park behind the mall, the entrance will be on your left.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1132427334000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston French Bulldog December Meetup</name><id>4803591</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1134844200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/4803591/</event_url></item>
