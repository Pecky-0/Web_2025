<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;NEW:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the 6:40 PM showing was discontinued, I moved this to the 10:30 PM showing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few people have expressed interest in meeting before the movie for a snack or a drink.  So lets try something different and meet around 8 PM at &lt;a href="http://www.johnharvards.com/index.shtml" target="_blank"&gt; John Harvard's&lt;/a&gt; in Shoppers World at One Worcester Road, Framingham, MA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that can't make it to John Harvard's, we will plan to regroup out front of the theater around 10 PM or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;OLD:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that Brendan Fraser just can't sit still this summer.  Not long after his journey to the center of the earth, he is off to China to combat the resurrected Han Emperor (played by Jet Li) in &lt;a href="http://www.moviefone.com/movie/the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor/29233/synopsis" target="_blank"&gt;The Mummy:  Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.  As is so often the case when mummies come to town, there is an ancient curse, lots of running, plenty of action, and, of course, some screaming as well.  So lets join in the fun and see how this third installment in the Mummy franchise compares to its predecessors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide my cell number to people I know are coming, so please RSVP and indicate how many friends or guests will be joining you so I know how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be standing out front and as Dana says "I look like my photo". =)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221866253000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219243477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Mummy:  Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</name><id>8583805</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219975200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/8583805/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
