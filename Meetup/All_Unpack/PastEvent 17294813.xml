Tickets still remain. There are no playoff or&amp;nbsp;Red Sox games in town this night. The Tasting begins at 7pm. I always advise arriving early as most venues&amp;nbsp;bring out the food early since there is a lot of wine to taste. Taking public transit is always&amp;nbsp;the best route.***&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Uncorked is turning SIX this year and is throwing a party to celebrate.
