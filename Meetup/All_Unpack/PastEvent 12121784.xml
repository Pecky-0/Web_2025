The sleepy New England campus is a seething mass of petty rivalry, backbiting and relentless social climbing. Into this provincial world arrives the Roach, a malignant insect from the ancient past who has mastered the art of controlling the minds of human beings. Over the course of an afternoon's play, PC's will seek to manuver their way up the academic ladder while the Roach pursues it's own unspeakable designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for the first in a series of one shot Indy RPG experiences to be offered monthly over the course of 2010. Each month will feature a different GM running a new game. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look the table with the green digest size books and rubber cockroaches.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tewhill</member_name><member_id>3431516</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263431403000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261345852000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January One-Shot - The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</name><id>12121784</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263056400000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/12121784/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/global_3081279.jpeg</photo_url></item>
