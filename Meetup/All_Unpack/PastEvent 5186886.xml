<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The October 9 meeting was great, but some members thought we should try something a little different for the October 23 meet-up. The Living Room, on the edge of the North End, has relaxed seating arrangements with sofas and easy chairs, just like a stanza vivente. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting we will discuss ideas for making future meetings more interesting. What would you like to do? Is there something you can share with the group? Bring an idea with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't matter whether your Italian skills are good or bad. (Mine are molto male). Come join us and practice. I will try to save sufficient seating at the back of the bar area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Warren Agin</member_name><member_id>299944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1161817516000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members of this group</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>italian-374</urlname><id>288923</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Italian Language Meetup Group &amp; Luned√¨ Italiano</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160438823000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Italian Language October 23 Meetup</name><id>5186886</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1161644400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-374/events/5186886/</event_url></item>
