&lt;p&gt;Please meet at the front door of The Essex condo (11 Church St, Salem - across from what some folks call "the Almy's parking lot" - you'll see the green awning) and then Sandy will take everyone downstairs to the Essex Room. Those who arrive later will need to call Sandy to get in (978-219-9292). Her number/directions will be posted on the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The on-street and metered lot parking (small lots) is free in the evening. Large parking lot is only free after 8pm. If you park in the garage Sandy can sell you a validation sticker that gives you free parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring your favorite games to play. Sandy will have a few (Luck of the Draw, Fluxx, Uno, Cribbage, Yahtzee, and several decks of cards). Nearby the function room, there is a rec area with a pool table and ping pong table that can accommodate a few players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beverages available, but feel free to bring snacks to share. &lt;a target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy</member_name><member_id>12789615</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316992131000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315428133000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Games at The Essex</name><id>32653662</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316905200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/32653662/</event_url></item>
