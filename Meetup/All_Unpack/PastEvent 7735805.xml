So, the original May posting was incorrect!   I think I fixed it for the future... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I plan the meetup for the second Sunday of the month, but I am going to be out of town that day(again-grrr).   Because everyone who provided feedback had such a good time at the April meetup, I am booking May's event for the THIRD Sunday of the month.  This way I can get in on the fun too! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Cricket's Restaurant in Smithfield for this month's event.  I know it is a little further North than the last few events, but &amp;quot;variety is the spice of life&amp;quot;, right?  It has a pre-fixe all you can eat buffet for $14.95 which includes a Bloody Mary or Mimosa for those who are inclined.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event fills up, please RSVP &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; with a comment requesting to be wait listed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to help defray the cost of hosting a group on meetup, I would like to ask all members who attend meetups to contribute a dollar at alternating events.  There will be no real tracking of this, but it would just be a good will donation to help me out.  Thanks all! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting everyone.  Yay brunch!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the one in the picture with the red hair :-)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211551370000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>You will get good food and great conversation with people who have similar interests(well at least in brunch anyway)...</why><group><who>Friends who brunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Brunch-Bunch</urlname><id>964634</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch !</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208171802000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch!
