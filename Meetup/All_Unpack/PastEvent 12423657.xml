Cast: Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Mélanie Laurent, Rod Taylor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quentin Tarantino takes a bold move into a more serious subject and survives with his movie-mad, post-modern style intact. Brad Pitt stars as a backwoods lieutenant plunged into World War II who leads a squadron of Jewish soldiers into surprise attacks on Nazis in France. His story interlocks with a French Jewish woman (Mélanie Laurent) working at a cinema in Paris after witnessing the death of her family, a fearless Allied spy from Germany (Diane Kruger), and a Nazi self-titled &amp;quot;Jew-hunter&amp;quot; played with psychopathic sangfroid by Christoph Waltz (Winner Best Supporting Actor - Golden Globes). Of course, being a Tarantino film means Inglourious Basterds is also about movies, as the director brilliantly riffs on World War II flicks, spaghetti Westerns, and European classics. &amp;quot;Contains all the things his fans like about Tarantino - the wit, the audacity, the sudden violence - but this movie's emotional core and bigness of spirit are new.&amp;quot; Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle.. Winner of Best performance By a Cast in a Motion Picture - Screen Actors Guild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inglouriousbasterds-movie.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.inglouriousbasterds-movie.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby.
