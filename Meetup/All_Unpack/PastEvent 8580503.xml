I'm not sure how to describe this for people who haven't been to a renaissance festival.  Expect a day of entertainments, bad puns, and lots of walking from place to place, as well as opportunities to see and purchase crafts and arts and participate in carnival games, the really old fashioned kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entry fee is $25, cash only.  Bring cash for food and any trinkets you think you'll be interested in. Some vendors may be able to accept credit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tentatively we'll meet at my place, arrange rides/carpools (can leave extra cars at my building) and then journey as a caravan to the faire in Carver, MA. Bonus points for dressing in something other than modern attire.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the parking lot of my building waiting for you..8)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223349477000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219194433000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>KIng Richards Faire</name><id>8580503</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223128800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/8580503/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
