There is a smaller entrance on Amherst that is set back from the street (as opposed to the main revolving doors). If you go in those doors you can go to your right and down the stairs immediately there (there is an elevator if you turn to the left at this entrance). At the bottom of the stairs you turn to the right and go to the end of the hall. Room 095 is on the left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also enter on 70 Memorial Drive as the room is on this side of the building. You can take the elevator or go to the stairs that are to the left when you enter. Again, go down to the LL (basement) level, turn to the right, and go all the way down the hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lindsay Calder√≥n</member_name><member_id>6777251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256315880000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256006555000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MIT Lunch Table -  Special Guest</name><id>11666158</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256142600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/11666158/</event_url></item>
