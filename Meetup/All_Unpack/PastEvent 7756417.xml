Perfect for a spring leisurely walk in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all of my hikes, kids and dogs are welcome, though this particular day I probably won't have either with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the 7-11 parking lot on the corner of Route 30 and Vernon Avenue in Vernon at 3:00 and travel from there to the trailhead together.  For those who know where the trailhead is on Tamarack, feel free to meet us there at 3:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions of meetup location at 7-11 on corner of Vernon Ave. and Rte. 30 in Vernon, CT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/399+vernon+ave+vernon+ct+06066/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions of trailhead at cul-de-sac on Tamarack Ln.
