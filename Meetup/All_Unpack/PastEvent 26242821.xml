It takes about 40-45 mins to walk around the pond. Most of it is paved and level but there is a small hill on one section and a rocky terrain on the other side. I've seen all kinds of strollers on the path so no worries. There are regular walkers, dog walkers, runners, bicyclists, and rollerbladers that share the path as well. There is a parking lot so we can meet there. I'm open to having lunch afterwards for those that are interested. We could picnic at the pond, go to Whole Foods (which is right around the corner), head to Hmart in Burlington (about 10 mins away), or go someplace else.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sonia</member_name><member_id>3086610</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312472312000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311052234000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's get active and go for a morning walk!</name><id>26242821</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1312468200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/26242821/</event_url></item>
