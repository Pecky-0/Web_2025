I hope you'll join us at 8PM for dinner. Check out the menu here, &lt;a href="http://www.bespokenewhaven.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bespokenew...&lt;/a&gt; ,  and then come and join us. We plan on meeting earlier at 6:30PM for drinks at &amp;quot;Downtown at the Taft&amp;quot;  &lt;a href="http://www.downtownatthetaft.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.downtownat...&lt;/a&gt; . So if you want to join us for a drink that would be great. This restaurtant is in demand so we must give them a final headcount on Nov 11th. If you RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; please make every effort to let us know before the 11th if your plans change.&lt;br /&gt;   The menu will be posted here soon but this is a fixed price restaurant. For $29 per person you'll get Appetizer, Entree and desert. So sign up early, this is going to be popular I think. I am looking forward to seeing everyone and to hopefully meeting some of our new members.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask for the "dining out group"</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>6</waitlist_count><updated>1258854265000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256076171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bespoke, We'll Bethere, Because, we Becool - Join us</name><id>11672803</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258160400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/11672803/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
