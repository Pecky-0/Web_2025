&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We usually arrival and warm up between 11:15 and 11:45a, with the game actually starting as close to 12p as possible.  Main playing field is Moses Brown.  Back up plan is Hope High school on the football field.  If both fields are being used, stay at Hope High and we will decided where to go from there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses Brown - 250 Lloyd Ave (inside the gates)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope High School - 324 Hope St. (in the back on the football field)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come join in the fun and play some ultimate frisbee! All skill levels are welcome! Don't worry if you have never played, we can teach you.  Competition is friendly and fun! Bring your friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you wear clothes and shoes good for running.  The amount of running will vary from person to person, but expect to run/jog/walk at least 1.5 miles.  Don't forget to bring a drink!  If you have cleats, feel free to wear them as long as they are plastic not metal.&lt;/p&gt;
