They open their doors 3:00 pm - 7:00 pm with special exhibits, discussions, painting demos, live music, refreshments, and more- all in a casual reception environment. Maps can be found online @ www.artwalknewburyport.com or at the visitor's center when you arrive. This event is FREE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quote from someone that has attended in the past years; “ARTWALK has always been greNewburyat! Some of the galleries go all out with refreshments, entertainment, and appetizers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be advised that this is a walking tour and we will be doing a lot of that. There is no set plan when finished with the tour- perhaps; Waterfront Park, the new self-serve ice cream parlor, the quaint lounges and restaurants, a walk along the water with some new friends, or take the 10 min drive to Plum Island and enjoy the beautiful sunset from the beach (whoooo).....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A SHARED EVENT with other meetup groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

* WE WILL MEETUP between 3:00 and 3:15 pm In front of The Firehouse Center For The Arts. If facing the center, the bench to the left- by the shady tree, myself or someone will be wearing a meetup.com pin or have a sign - my contact # will be added closer to the date. **Parking can be tight - so try to plan accordingly. Please consider carpooling with other members. It’s a great way to get to know someone new or travel with a friend. Just post your comments&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Ordway</member_name><member_id>4903547</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350824407000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347034397000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ARTWALK NEWBURYPORT - Last of the Season!</name><id>81317502</id><headcount>42</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350759600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/81317502/</event_url></item>
