Your leather chair is the driver or passenger seat from a Limousine and will have one armrest, recline, and is on wheels. Next,  check out their diverse menu. Your waiter or waitress will be around to take your order so you don't have to miss any of the good parts! Quench that thirst and grab a bite to eat. Chunky's menu selections currently include beer and wine, (21 and over only) soft drinks, and a variety of pub-style food selections. Get there early and enjoy your meal before the movie starts.
