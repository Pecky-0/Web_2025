&lt;p&gt;"The novel has also been touted as an allegory of the events of 9/11. It  is a novel about life and death, love and grief, and hope. Taking place  in New York City in 1974, on the day that Philippe Petit walked on a  tightrope between the World Trade Center towers, the story merges the  lives and losses of seemingly unrelated people. The chapters tell the  stories of different characters; some related to each other some  closely, some remotely. They are all somehow touched by the events  taking place in the 110th floor of the two towers." It truely sounds like an excellent book. I look forward to a lively discussion&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I wanted to try a new place.
