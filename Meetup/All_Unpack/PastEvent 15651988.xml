We will tackle these mountains in 2011. I don't have a date yet but will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are interested in participating in this event be sure to answer all of the required questions during the RSVP process. Unless you are someone that I hike with regularly please take the time to answer them with as much information as possible - even if you have answered them before.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the objective of this trip is to enjoy ourselves as we climb, your safety, and the safety of the others in our group, is the most important thing. If you underestimate the demands of this trip, or overestimate your skills and abilities, you may put yourself and/or others at risk - consider this before you decide to participate.&lt;/b&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lafayette (5,260 feet - #6 on NH 48) represents the highest peak in the Franconia Ridge and, from the summit, offers a stunning view of the Pemigewasset Wilderness Area. Lincoln (5,089 feet - # 7 on NH 48), a part of the popular and scenic Franconia Ridge, bears a sharp, rugged peak with excellent views of the surrounding area and an array of alpine plants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;This hike will involve prolonged periods above treeline - be prepared for windy and icy conditions. Dangerous weather will postpone this event.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan will be to do some sledding on the way back down the mountain so if you want to join in the fun you will need your own sled. The most popular choices are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3655510" target="_blank"&gt;The Zipfy Sled&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4450226" target="_blank"&gt;The Slidy Sled&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqCL5uQw2yM&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"&gt;Click here to see a video compliation of previous Random SledFest events.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have hiked these peaks and used these trails before, I did all of my current research using the AMC's &lt;i&gt;White Mountain Guide&lt;/i&gt;, a trail map, and the Internet. The links below provide an overview of where we will be going and include topographic maps of the area. You should become familiar with this information since you are ultimately responsible for your own safety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6909" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more information about Lafayette from Peakbagger.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trailsnh.com/NH-4000.php#lafayette" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for trail conditions near Lafayette from TrailsNH.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6911" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more information about Lincoln from Peakbagger.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trailsnh.com/NH-4000.php#lincoln" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for trail conditions near Lincoln from TrailsNH.com&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it looks like dangerous weather conditions will cancel this event we may simply go elsewhere and climb to a different summit. I will notify confirmed participants of any planned changes a day or two ahead of time. The plan will be to hike somewhere in the White Mountains.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &amp;quot;no dogs&amp;quot; hike.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trip Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this loop hike we will follow the Old Bridle Path and Greenleaf Trail to Lafayette and then the Franconia Ridge Trail to Lincoln before coming down the Falling Waters Trail to get back to the trailhead.         &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;On this moderate pace trip we will hike about 8.9 miles and climb about 4,200 feet (&lt;i&gt;for perspective the top floor of the Empire State Building is about 1,250 feet&lt;/i&gt;). It should take an average hiker about 9.0 hours to complete this hike during the summer â€“ this does not include time for breaks or lunch. This hike is considered ADVANCED because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain.&lt;/b&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you. Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you have ANY questions about your ability to participate in and complete this entire trip please contact me.&lt;/b&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;              &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is winter in the mountains. Dangerous weather conditions will cancel this hike - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mountwashington.org/weather/forecast.php" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for the current weather forecast for this trip.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing and Equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a list describing the &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;minimum required&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; clothing and equipment to participate in this event. DO NOT rely on others to have extra clothing or equipment to share with you once we are out on the trails. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Footwear: Hiking boots or trail shoes. Snowshoes and crampons are mandatory (you can bring microspikes but only as a back-up).          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clothing: Dress in layers to easily regulate body temperature. Wear synthetic shirt/pants and bring a fleece jacket/wool sweater - ABSOLUTELY NO COTTON.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outerwear: Waterproof/windproof rain jacket with hood.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food and Water: High-energy snacks, food for lunch, and enough water to stay hydrated during the trip. Hydration bladders may freeze during winter - bottles with insulating sleeves work best.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other Essential Gear: Map and compass. Plastic whistle. Headlamp with two sets of spare batteries (lithium work best in cold temperatures). Personal first aid kit. An emergency space blanket (e.g. mylar). Small pocket knife or multi-purpose tool. Toilet kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items). Sunscreen. Lip balm. Sunglasses. Waterproof cover for your pack.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optional Items: Waterproof/windproof pants. Waterproof gaiters. Trekking poles. Camera.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;           &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it &lt;u&gt;prior&lt;/u&gt; to this trip.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not certified or trained in wilderness first aid. You will need to bring any medications or medical supplies that you may need during the trip.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling is encouraged - indicate in your RSVP if you need a ride or can give one. You are responsible for making your own arrangements so you should check back often and contact others who might want/need to carpool.          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All MAYBE RSVPs will be changed to NO three days before the event so people who might be on the WAITING LIST have an opportunity to make the necessary arrangements in order to participate.         &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin this hike at 7:00 AM. According to Google Maps this meeting spot is about 139 miles from Boston and it should take about 2 hours 18 minutes to drive there.        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://local.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Boston,+MA&amp;amp;daddr=44.142066,-71.681358(Old+Bridle+Path+%5BFranconia+Range%5D,+Falling+Waters+Trailhead)&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FZ9WhgIdw7bD-ykbMT0NLWXjiTGg6GIBJL98eA%3BFfKNoQIdsjq6-w&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;sll=44.142066,-71.681358&amp;amp;sspn=0.007376,0.019205&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=8" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for driving directions to the meeting spot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you and your guests acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the organizer(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the organizer(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a Green Toyota or a White Lexus.
