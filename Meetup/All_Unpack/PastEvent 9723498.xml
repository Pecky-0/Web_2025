Sunglasses and appropriate layers are recommended, as typically the hike starts out cold but warms up quickly.  Be prepared to have a way of attaching your snowshoes &lt;br /&gt;to your pack as they may not be needed all day. There is a distinct possibility that sliding down the trail will be part of the fun on the descent so nylon pants are recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total distance is 6 miles round trip and about 1800 feet of elevation. The pace will be steady but matched to the abilities of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case someone does try to go to the trailhead, realize that Dugway road is not typically plowed west of the trailhead, despite the insistence of some mapping programs that it is passable!.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dennis P is your hike leader  cell phone Saturday 603-986-3818</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234793310000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234393629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South and Middle Moats </name><id>9723498</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234620000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9723498/</event_url></item>
