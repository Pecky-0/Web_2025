FREE to not only our lineman here at FIT, but any lineman at any airport. All they have to do is show up and prove they work for an airport. Full time or part time, who cares. They work hard for us... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's roll out some planes for them to ride in and not just top off for us...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work hard for us and are always there for fuel, rides, lend a hand pushing your plane out or coming by with a compressor for air... Jacks of all trades and they are the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other ideas are welcome, but here's a start. We'll need some help cooking and cleaning and bring your significant other for this family gathering at the Bullock Hangar for our (politically incorrect, I know, but sounds better) Lineman Appreciation Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                             &lt;i&gt; &lt;b&gt; SET UP FROM 10:00- 10:30 ISH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248301197000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245728219000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FPA Lineman Appreciation Day</name><id>10713652</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248017400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/10713652/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/global_9306216.jpeg</photo_url></item>
