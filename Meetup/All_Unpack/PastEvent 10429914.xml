<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The plan &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at South Station at 4.30pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Train leaves south Station at 4.45 and arrives in Providence at 5.50pm.  I don't know providence very well so do the people who are meeting us down there want to suggest a meeting place or can we meet at the station? If you plan on meeting us at the Station let me know, my cell phone is  617 840 5142 . Or you can just call and find out where we are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming back, the last train leaves at 10pm which is a bit early but there is a Greyhound which most of us are planning on getting to get us back into Boston at 1am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people can't make the 4.45 train, they leave every two hours so just get a later one and call my cell phone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you tomorrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248726822000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242564585000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence - WaterFire night</name><id>10429914</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248553800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/10429914/</event_url></item>
