If so, please join me for a quick lunch at Legal Seafoods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be 99.9% sure you can make it if you reply yes.  No-shows are a no-no because I'll have a reservation.  Thanks for understanding!  I'll give out my cell phone # to the people who reply yes, just in case you need to cancel at the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check out their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.legalseafoods.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.legalseafo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone again!  I missed you all in January ... A rough month for me!  But, I'm back ... Thanks to Tonya for adding me as an assistant!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I made a reservation for 4 people and I have given out my cell phone # to the people who have replied yes.  If there is anyone who wants to join us now, you'll need to email me and get a response back from me.  I'll see if the restaurant can add another seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174234190000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171376595000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Afternoon Lunch!</name><id>5477607</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174060800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/5477607/</event_url></item>
