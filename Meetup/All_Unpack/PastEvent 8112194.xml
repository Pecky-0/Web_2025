When you get to Joe's, ask for the Libertarian Meetup group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month there was a bit of confusion, as Joe's was closed for renovations.  We still managed to meet, at the Papa Razzi on Dartmouth.  Despite the problems, we still had about six people show up.  Let's see if we can't do better this month!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you can't find the meeting, you can call my cell: (312) 497-9903.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave</member_name><member_id>4297517</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216268327000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Libertarians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>libertarian-349</urlname><id>593245</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Area Libertarian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213056528000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Area Libertarian July Meeting</name><id>8112194</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215990000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/libertarian-349/events/8112194/</event_url></item>
