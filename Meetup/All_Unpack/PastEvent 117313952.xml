 &lt;br /&gt;

 When you go out to social gatherings (including meetup events), do you find yourself wishing that people would see through your shyness and take the time to discover the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you that's hiding inside? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If you answered "yes" to either of these questions, then you're going to love this. In this unique event, you'll gain a critical skill that will help you become more interesting and attractive to others. When you have this skill, you'll be able to experience the kind of effortless connections that you've been hoping for when you go out to socialize. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

 THE SECRET IS IN THE PERSONAL STORIES YOU SHARE WITH OTHERS &lt;br /&gt;

 ************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 It's not enough to say to people, "I have this quality and that quality." Listing facts about yourself in a conversation is boring and usually compels people to find someone else to talk to. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The way to convey your personality to others is through the stories you tell, and not by merely communicating data. But you and I know it's not that simple. The trouble with telling our personal stories is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We sometimes don't know what to say, where to start, or how to even say it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know how to tell them in a concise and interesting manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't know if people are even interested in hearing our stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what this special workshop is all about. You'll discover how to talk to people in a way that lets them get to know the real you, while also being interesting and attractive in a social environment. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

 HERE'S A SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'LL LEARN: &lt;br /&gt;

 ************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The single most important thing you must say &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you tell a story that will &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; capture people's attention and make them want to listen to what comes next. Once you master this technique, your conversations will become effortless and natural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll do a simple exercise that will mine your brain for the gold that's trapped within, and help you discover how many interesting personal stories you really do have. These are stories that will bring people closer and make them want to spend more time with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The secret structure of a good conversational story, and how to use it to instantly make your stories more interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll do a fun drill from improv comedy that will train your mind to effortlessly keep a conversation going. Your stories will flow smoothly and naturally in every conversation as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 By the end of this workshop, you will have at least one story that is ready to use in any social environment, and that will help people get to know the real you. Plus, you'll also possess a proven formula for coming up with an unlimited number of stories on your own. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

 HOW TO GET INVOLVED &lt;br /&gt;

 ************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is it?&lt;/strong&gt; The seminar is conveniently located at the Watertown Center For Healing Arts which is a beautiful facility for an event like this.    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;What time?&lt;/strong&gt; Please plan on arriving by 6:45pm so you have time to settle in and meet the other members. We start promptly at 7:00pm and go until 9:30pm (with a break in the middle).  There are plenty of bus lines that go to the center, and there is also lots of parking both on the street and in a big parking lot near the center.  The bottom of this page has details:    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://watertowncenter.net/directions-2/"&gt;http://watertowncenter.net/directions-2/    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much?&lt;/strong&gt; Cheap.  If you took a class like this through an adult education center, you'd easily pay more than $50 to attend, and that's assuming there even &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a class that could offer you all this, which there isn't.      &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

No other class offers you this kind of cutting edge training that's based in real world results.  This stuff WORKS!  What if one small change is all it takes to immediately and effortlessly begin attracting high-quality friends and dating prospects into your life?  I've seen it happen many times in this group, and it can happen for you too.     &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;So how much?&lt;/strong&gt; Because I want to help as many people as I can, I've decided to keep the price very affordable so that anyone who wants to come will be able to.  The cost for this event is only $20, which is very low considering the quality of training that you'll be getting.    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Think about it... &lt;strong&gt;that's 67 cents a day for a month&lt;/strong&gt;.  What else do you spend 67 cents on every day that makes no difference in your social life (or love life) whatsoever? I promise that this will be well worth your time.    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;How big is the class?&lt;/strong&gt; In order to make sure I can personally help as many people as possible, the class is limited to the first 40 people who RSVP.  We are using a smaller room than the one that's normally available, so I really do have to limit size.  There are over 1,300 people seeing this, so if you want in, then be sure to put in your RSVP right now in order to lock in your spot.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I'm looking forward to seeing you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Warmly,     &lt;br /&gt;
