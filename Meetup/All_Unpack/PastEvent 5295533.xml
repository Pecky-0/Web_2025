Please make sure to RSVP for this meetup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this meeting we are also holding a children's book drive for the Open Pantry in Springfield.  Please bring a children's book with you to donate if you can.  The books will go to children staying in shelters associated with the Open Pantry.  If you have questions please review Lisa's post on the message board and make a reply or send a private message through the contact link on the left side of the page.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, you do not have to have finished the book to come.  Just bring your book and be prepared to have a great time.  Friends and family are welcome.  At the end of the book discussion we will go over ideas for the next month's book choices and future book club events.  We look forward to seeing you and having another great book discussion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melissa</member_name><member_id>3059165</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168558457000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1164759009000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Book Club January Meetup</name><id>5295533</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168385400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/5295533/</event_url></item>
