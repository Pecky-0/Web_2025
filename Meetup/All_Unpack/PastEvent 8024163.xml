Very little consciousness was brought to developing deeply loving relationships that were not to be romantic or physical. Nor was there hardly any advice given about where sexuality belongs in relationships that are romantic and physical, while seeking to have God at their center. Now, in the 21st Century, we have been given the assignment to bring Light, consciousness, and God into these issues. We will be addressing both how to approach finding a mate and where spirituality and sexuality belong in an already-established relationship. We will also speak about being single, the celibate life, and deep, meaningful relationships that are platonic.  Join us for this seminar, and get all your questions answered!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
