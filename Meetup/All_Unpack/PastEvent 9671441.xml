In the spiritual life, a disciple decides to arrange their life in order to follow a way that leads to spiritual growth and fulfillment of a life mission. Come and learn what it means to be a disciple on a spiritual path, and what in your life might need to change in order for that to become a reality. &lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the presenter:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher.
