We will pay for building materials and paint. The tournament will be held at the end of May. Would your group be willing to donate your time to build the game boards for our school? &lt;br /&gt;

We will have lunch (provided) after the build and then take a short hike along side the Cavendish Gorge. This should be a fun day and will be posted on other meetup sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping Stones Preschool in Proctorsville, Vermont has been serving the community and children since 1977. &lt;br /&gt;

I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
