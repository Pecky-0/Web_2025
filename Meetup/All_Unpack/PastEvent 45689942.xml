&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The Point Tavern (formally Abe's)!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you're all tuckered out from the holiday cheer and have just recently pulled the lampshade off your head, so why not come down to The Point Tavern, celebrate the New Year, relax and ease back into the work week hanging out with friends for some easy socializing and good conversation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Point Tavern (formally Abe's) is a cozy, warm bar complete with low lighting, booth and bar seating and a "grad" clientele. Under new management, the name has changed but not the atmosphere and its still one of my favorites! We've been here on various occasions, but never for an MNM because they weren't open on Mondays before. So ta-da! Now they are and here we go! Its one you'll want to know about and you'll be back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat - the drinks are great, but there's no food. HOWEVER, you can order from any fine Providence establishment for delivery, select from one of the restaurants along Wickenden Street and bring it in, OR if you like, bring something from home. Options abound!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on dialing for dinner or opting for catering from Chez Elsbeth and planting myself for a few hours of social fun and good conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're hard to miss!!!
