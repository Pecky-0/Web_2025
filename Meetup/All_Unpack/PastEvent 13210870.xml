We both agreed that the asking of questions respective to basic beliefs is probably at the very heart of philosophy.  Philosophy can arguably be described as a string of questions designed to lay bare fundamental conceptions about values and beliefs about, most generally, human existence and its relationship to the universe, but more specifically to such things as reality, good-bad-right-wrong, on being and on being human, truth and falsehood, “the meaning of life,” the meaning of meaning and well…you get the picture.  There is a lot of infinite regress here because, quite simply, much of the questioning may never have an end.  But, at least in my view, the purpose of philosophy is to at least try to get closer to answers for these sorts of questions even while we remain wary of the presence of illusion or self-delusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let’s have a good-spirited conversation concerning the frailty of our beliefs.  To ask questions need not mean that the questioner seeks to demolish the belief in question.  More generally, the purpose of philosophical questioning may be to deepen our understanding of why we believe what we believe.  The philosopher’s ‘Why?” is merely an invitation for further inquiry.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/pages/No_Show_Policy/"&gt;No Show Policy&lt;/a&gt; (please read)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274121595000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271540124000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Questions, Questions, Questions.
