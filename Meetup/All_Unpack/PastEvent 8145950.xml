If we don't meet the numbers, we can shoot to do this another day, and everyone will be refunded the money.&lt;br /&gt;We're looking to meet about 8:30 a.m. in Belchertown (exactly location to be determined, but think coffee shop parking lot) and head to the put-in location en masse.  Will spend some time getting equipped, a bit of review on strokes, and after a few hours on the water, will conclude about 1:30-2 p.m. to get everyone home in time for burgers and fireworks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A yes RSVP will be considered a commitment, as I need to let our guides know ASAP if they will be spending their fourth in our company.  Please be respectful of their time and generosity in giving us this special price for the equipment and their leadership and be willing to commit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must register by Wednesday (that's right, this Wednesday the 18th) by RSVPing yes and sending payment ($35) ASAP to Holyoke Rows, PO Box 4936, Holyoke, Ma. 01041.  I realize this is short notice (yes, that does mean getting the checks in the mail by Tuesday a.m.), but all will be refunded if the numbers are not met, and the payments are not received by that time.  That means, indeed, decisions must be made rapidly, so embrace your spontaneous side, throw the check in the mail and join us!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring lunch, snack, water, sunscreen, hat, bug repellant, change of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details to follow, contact Lisa with questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa/vetchick</member_name><member_id>4120480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215347978000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213528004000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Independence Day on the Water</name><id>8145950</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215174600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/8145950/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/2/global_2186386.jpeg</photo_url></item>
