While some Impressionist artists blurred the edges and deleted the human body from their compositions, Degas remained the consummate draughtsman, studying and drawing the human and animal anatomy from many perspectives throughout his career. He created his stunning pastels using an innovative technique of layering color and fixative; these and his oil canvases remain fresh and vibrant. Hear about his techniques and his treasures in Hill-Stead's collection in this gallery talk. Free to members or with museum admission.
