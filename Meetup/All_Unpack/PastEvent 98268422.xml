&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If heading east on Route 101 get off at Exit 2 in Auburn and turn right at the end of the ramp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If heading west on Route 101 get off at Exit 2 in Auburn and turn left at the end of the ramp:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proceed south on Hooksett Rd. for 0.8 miles passing Holidays Bar and Grill. Just after cresting the top of a hill and staring downhill again turn left onto Depot Rd. and proceed 0.2 miles passing 23 Depot Rd. There is a dirt parking lot on the left.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hike will be primarily for those people and their dogs going to the Secret Santa Paws event.  The idea is to give the dogs some exercise before attending the event so hopefully they will be better behaved during the event as they will have already have gotten some exercise so might be less rambuctious at the event.  We will hike one of the Fomba mountain bike trails trying to avoid the winter snowmobile trails as much as possible.  Hopefully, the winter snowmobile trails we do use will be less traveled as they really don't go anywhere. From the parking lot to the Barking Dog is maybe about a ten minute drive or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any adult guest you want to bring should sign up on the meetup site as a member so they will be covered by the liability waiver. A minor would need a written waiver signed by a parent or guardian&lt;/p&gt;
