It's eye-opening and necessary.&amp;quot;-- Ariel Fried, Anti-Defamation League &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of World War II, sixty minutes of raw film, having sat undisturbed in an East German archive, was discovered. Shot by the Nazis in Warsaw in May 1942, and labeled simply &amp;quot;Ghetto,&amp;quot; &lt;u&gt;the footage quickly gained traction as an important historical document, and has been used by archivists and documentary filmmakers over the past several decades to show what life was like in the ghetto.&lt;/u&gt; The images—accepted as reality—have now been proven to be a cinematic deception, as the Nazis had staged nearly all the scenes. The discovery of a long-missing fifth reel revealed the elaborate ruse: outtakes depict staged and choreographed scenes taken from various angles, even unintentionally capturing glimpses of SS cameramen behind the scenes. Much of what was once regarded as fact has been given a new truth. &lt;b&gt;A Film Unfinished&lt;/b&gt; presents the entire film for the first time—carefully noting fictionalized sequences that falsely show &amp;quot;the good life&amp;quot; enjoyed by Jewish urbanites—and probes deep into the making of a now-infamous Nazi propaganda film. Kendall Descripton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Gratifying in its ethical insistence that there are true things in the world, and that it is necessary for us to know them.”  NY Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Film Unfinished&lt;/b&gt; trailer  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7egcyAdbk" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we'll go to a nearby restaurant for our  group discussion. I truly think this is  film that should be  shared.&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tom will be holding a Red Meetup sign near the front row after the film.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284164723000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Film Unfinished</name><id>14729312</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286042400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/14729312/</event_url></item>
