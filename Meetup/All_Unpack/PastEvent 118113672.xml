The presentation will begin at 7:30pm. Please join us in supporting the Society and hear the cutting edge science directly from one of the investigators for this return to the Moon mission! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Dr. Anthony Case is an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. His primary research involves the design, operation, and analysis of data from space-based particle detectors. He is a &lt;br /&gt;

co-investigator on the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Moon measuring high energy radiation. He also works on instruments that will measure the solar wind on upcoming missions called Solar Probe Plus and Deep-Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission was first conceived of as part of the Vision for Space Exploration, announced in 2004. As an exploration-based mission, it was designed to gather the necessary information to allow humans to return to the Moon for the first time since Apollo 17. After launching in 2009 and accomplishing all of its exploration objectives, the LRO mission has continued to orbit the Moon collecting valuable science data. This presentation will focus on the rationale for the He will discuss the steps necessary to design, build, test, and fly a scientific instrument in space and show some of the amazing pictures and other scientific data that have been returned by the LRO mission. Dr. Case will spend a portion of the time focusing on radiation measurements and the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) instrument. &lt;br /&gt;
