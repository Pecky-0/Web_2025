It's also supposed to rain on Saturday but just showers are predicted on Sunday. I am changing this meetup to 11:30 am on Sunday, that time slot is for the meal but I plan to be there closer to 10 am to take the tour that explains the sugaring process. The tours end at 1 pm. - Anna&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Drumlin Farm Sanctuary Committee invites you a Sap-to-Syrup Farmer's Breakfast on Saturday and Sunday, March 13 and 14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real maple syrup on fresh pancakes is the centerpiece of Mass Audubon's Drumlin Farm's annual Sap-to-Syrup Farmer's Breakfast, but don't forget about our homemade sausage and roasted potatoes! Join us for a filling and fun breakfast on March 13 and 14 from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm. The cost is $14 for adults, $11 for children and free for children under 2. Reservations in advance are required. To register, please call 781-259-2206. Before or after your breakfast explore the natural history of maple trees, and see how sap is collected from Drumlin Farm's sugar bush. Tours are ongoing between 9:00 am and 1:00 pm, and will include a visit to our evaporator, where we boil down the tree sap into the maple syrup we know and love. Learn how the Native Americans produced syrup and why the season is so short here in eastern Massachusetts.
