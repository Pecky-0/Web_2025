A new event will be posted soon.....:)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its been a while since there has been a dinner party! Let's change that with a fun, casual night of pizza and good conversation in the relaxing setting of my home.You bring the beer/wine. Ill provide the pizza (with veg and vegan options), dessert and non-alcholic beverages. There will be some group facilitated intros and icebreakers as well as a bunch of time to mingle and enjoy getting to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is $15.There is a minimum of 20 people for the event to happen and a maximum of 50 people, so please RSVP early. I might have to start a wait list if there is a gender balance issue as we get closer to the date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of street parking near my house and my home is also only a short walk from the Porter Square T-stop on the Red Line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to call me directly with any questions or simply to connect before coming to my home. :)  413-320-3991&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A personal note:  I'm really excited to be the new organizer of this meetup. Robyn has a wonderful new venture that is taking her on a different path and she asked me to take over the group. I'm really looking forward to meeting you all! Trish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
