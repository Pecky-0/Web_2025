Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Socializing for Justice at Sacco's Bowl Haven for Bowling for Justice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sacco's features candlepin bowling.  Whether it's your first time or you're a candlepin pro, just come to enjoy yourself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP yes, maybe or no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Socializing for Justice (SoJust) is for feminists, people working against racism, queer pioneers, genderbenders, environmental agitators, class activists, lefty artists and all people across Greater Boston working for justice in our neighborhoods, in our nation and beyond. But it's not work! Instead, we're building a strong cross-issue network through fun social events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join the Socializing for Justice Meetup Board and you'll be able to view and post events, job &amp;amp; volunteer announcements, roommate searches, print &amp;amp; on-line resources - and you'll be able to suggest/coordinate future SoJust events like this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://socializingforjustice.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://socializingforjustice.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://socializingfor...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1162421366000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1158629142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bowling for Justice</name><id>5138605</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1161907200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/5138605/</event_url></item>
