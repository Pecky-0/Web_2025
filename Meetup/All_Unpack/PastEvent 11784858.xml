Want to talk about it and how it has changed your life, or listen to the stories of others who have also had spiritual experiences?  Our group is informal, but we have a few things planned, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will explore the common types of spiritual experiences such as dreams, visions, and feelings of divine love. And, we will share techniques for gaining a greater understanding of your experience, how to ask God/Spirit/life/the Universe a question and a few techniques for finding an answer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to meeting you at our Meetup!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the downstairs meeting room, located to the left of the downstairs entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabelle Morton</member_name><member_id>10332926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260019425000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group</urlname><id>1551111</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Central Connecticut Spiritual Experiences Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257278621000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Have You Had a Spiritual Experience?</name><id>11784858</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258815600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Central-Connecticut-Spiritual-Experiences-Group/events/11784858/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/c/global_11630812.jpeg</photo_url></item>
