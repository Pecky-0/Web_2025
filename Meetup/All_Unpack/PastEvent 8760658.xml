My personal goal is to have an equal amount of men and women &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually have a close ratio of men and women. The last dance we had 45 women and 40 men.  Pease invite quality men you know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This group was formed on the principle of synergy. Working together to invite quality people. We must take responsibility for inviting people. Again, my personal goal is to have an equal ratio of men and women, hope you will help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are more women it is because you invited women, not men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can sign up on &lt;a href="http://dance.meetup.com/393/"&gt;http://dance.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;130 guests only. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the time, the location, what you should bring.
