And, not to mention checking out all the interesting, fashionable outfits.  We'll head over to the Cheesecake Factory for Cosmos and Cheesecake after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting Time: 6:30pm: We'll meet at 6:30pm by the ticket counter in the lobby.  We'll head into the theater at 6:40pm.  **Please be on time**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, Chris Noth &lt;br /&gt;Director: Michael Patrick King&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the spirit of Sex and the City, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha, we'll walk over to the Cheesecake factory for Cosmos and Cheesecake after!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just a few quick notes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As always, please be on time.&lt;br /&gt;- After the movie, we'll walk over as a group to the next venue and PLEASE save the discussion of the movie until we are at the restaurant.  It'll give us something to talk about after the movie over drinks and dessert.&lt;br /&gt;- Gratuity when seated at the restaurant....always count on tipping 15% unless the service is poor (we can discuss this as a group).  If the service is exceptional at the restaurant, you are welcome to contribute more than 15% towards the tip.    This tipping and making correct payments is pretty important because as the Hartford Movie Meetup Group, we would like to build positive relationships with the local restaurants and theaters and not get booed or feel unwelcomed at any venue.  **I will have a calculator with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking forward to the movie and event!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please look for each other in the lobby.  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>3461529</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275747526000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275410227000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sex and the City 2 </name><id>13658213</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275690600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/13658213/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/d/global_15442109.jpeg</photo_url></item>
