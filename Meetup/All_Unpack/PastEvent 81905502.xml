 THE THROWDOWN BAND: &lt;br /&gt;

 The ThrowDown Band exploded onto the Boston music scene in late 2009, and in a short time they attained the reputation of a band to be reckoned with in the New Blues Era; they are widely regarded as the next big act to come out of Boston. ThrowDown’s first release, “Let Sleeping Dogs Lie”, was selected as the ‘Best Self-produced CD’ by the Boston Blues Society, and has been submitted to the IBC for inclusion in the 2012 International Blues Competition, in Memphis. An aggressive, take no prisoners, guitar-shredding, soul-screaming approach to music puts them in a hard-to-define, multi-genre rock/electric-blues/rock category. And one thing is for sure: they do not disappoint! From excruciatingly soulful slow jams to hard-hitting, genre-bending rockers, a night with ThrowDown is full of peaks and valleys building to a crescendo that will slam you into a climactic explosion; leaving you dripping with sweat and begging for more. wwww.thethrowdonwband.com&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348929672000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347384615000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Throwdown Band @ Wicked Twisted- Nashua</name><id>81905502</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348876800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/81905502/</event_url></item>
