Grooves, multi-instrumentalist and singer for the eponymous band, will be accompanied by both Brazilian and American musicians and will be performing as the headlining act. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grooves brings a refreshing angle to traditional Brazilian Popular Music by infusing an infectious groove that benefits from his carefully crafted lyrics. Further influencing and informing his authentic music style are his experiences playing with fellow world music greats Maurício Manieri, Seu Jorge, Cláudio Zoli, and Jair Oliveira. His debut record “Amanhã eu não vou trabalhar” (Tomorrow I'll Not Work), which features performances from Seu Jorge and Céu, has garnered him national and international acclaim, claiming iTunes’ Top Ten Best Brazilian Records of 2007, and Latin Grammy nominations in 5 categories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional venue and performance information visit www.ryles.com.
