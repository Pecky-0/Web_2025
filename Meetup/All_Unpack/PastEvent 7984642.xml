<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We apologize to everyone that there hasn't been a Meetup for a while (in between sickness and being out of town, we haven't been able to host).  We're looking forward to starting off the summer though.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Saturday will be a traditional game night.  Bring any favorites that you might like to play, otherwise we're fully stocked.  We'll plan on ordering pizza at some point during the night as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who may be new, parking can be a little a tricky, but there are usually plenty of spots available on Cross St.  Our house is pumpkin colored and the home to two cats who will be locked up for the evening.  The door will be unlocked, so just come on in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We certainly look forward to seeing everyone!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213053072000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211393128000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night in June</name><id>7984642</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212879600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7984642/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/8/9/global_3094489.jpeg</photo_url></item>
