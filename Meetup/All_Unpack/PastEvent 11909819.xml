<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 2 mile looping hike of higher difficulty for the first half to get the juices flowing and to pay for the Thanksgiving feast later in the day. For the first half we'll hike up the steep grade of the Giant's head and do clifftop hiking to the backside of the head and back down again. We'll return on the dirt road for an easy conclusion to the hike.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot across from Quinnipiac University at 9 AM. The hike would start from the trailhead off of the parking lot.  We would finish at about 11 AM and possibly head out to eat if people feel inclined and a place can be found open on Thanksgiving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate location/directions for parking lot meetup location&lt;/b&gt; off Mt.
