<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm offering up my place if some people wanted to get together and have some drinks and food before going out Friday night. I live in Southington, so it's relatively close to Waterbury. Also, if you wanted to carpool from my place, there is plenty of visitor parking (and maybe an opportunity for an after party depending on what kind of mood everyone is in). I'll have some snacks and you can bring your drink of choice and we can socialize. This will be nice to be social and low-key and then get amped up for the night out. Address to be sent to RSVPs later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317666952000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317166070000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday night Pre-party at My Place</name><id>35231492</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317425400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/35231492/</event_url></item>
