The Boston Young Professionals are hosting a Party at LIR in Boston.  The cost is $35, but it includes line priviledges, food and two drinks.   Their email address is www.bostonypa.com.  I have already purchesed my tickets and will get there around noon.  You don't have to buy ticket with the Boston Young Professionals if you still want to attend.   LIR is charging a $20 cover and it's great Irish Pub..  As the day approaches I will figure out a place for everyone to meet.  And I will also find a way to distinguish our group!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3910704</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174924363000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New Residents</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-666</urlname><id>375609</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston New In Town Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172236218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>St Patty's Day at LIR</name><id>5506943</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174147200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-666/events/5506943/</event_url></item>
