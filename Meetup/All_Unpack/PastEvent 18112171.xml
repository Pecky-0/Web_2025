Everyone needs to bring a "potluck" food item to the event to share in case there is not enough men who know how to cook! Men; I have enough minor ingredients in my home to help you along in preparing your dish, but please bring along any other necessary food items. Also we will be playing some single social interaction games. So come out and have fun, eat a lot and meet plenty of new people. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at: 603-312-6735. Thanks.
