For example, in May, we mentioned Orson Scott Card's tips about distinguishing between major, minor, and walk-on characters. We're all struggling with learning how to create sympathetic characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge: Find a story with a character you love. How did the writer do that to you? Dig into the text and find where it shows one aspect of what makes the character so compelling. Be prepared to cite your example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:00 Names. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: What a character!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:00 Break&lt;br /&gt;Open Discussion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00 Go Home and Write!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213128651000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210453906000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers June Meeting</name><id>7913540</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212955200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/7913540/</event_url></item>
