A surreal adaptation of Lewis Carroll's children's classic Alice in Wonderland, the film stars Kristyna Kohoutov√° as Alice, the only human character in the film. The other roles, which are voiced by Alice, are filled by an odd menagerie of animated clay, puppets, and meat. After falling &lt;span&gt;asleep beside a stream, Alice follows a stuffed rabbit into a magical world where she encounters several grotesque-looking characters, including a caterpillar and The Mad Hatter. Also released under the title Alice, Neco Z Alenky was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award at the 1989 Fantasporto Film Festival. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my two favorite Alice in wonderland film adaptations. (the other being the BBC TV, Jonathan Miller directed) - Please join me and enter the strange and wonderful world of director Jan Svankmajer's Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
