I will be at the theater by 5:45.   Look for me by the big windows at the top of the escaltors.  I will try to snag a table so we can gather.   We should try to head in for seats at 6.   If you are running late, or don't find the group before the movie, we will gather outside the room we watch the movie in for short post movie discussion and a head count of those who want to head out for dinner and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the movie is showing downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.  If it is upstairs, I will try to snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we will gather just outside of the room we have just watched the movie in to discuss the film.  For those who are interested, we will go out for drinks and munchies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wolfman &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: February 12, 2010  &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Universal Pictures  &lt;br /&gt;Director: Joe Johnston  &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Andrew Kevin Walker, David Self  &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Hugo Weaving, Art Malik  &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Action, Horror  &lt;br /&gt;Official Website:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thewolfmanmovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thewolfman...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Inspired by the classic Universal film that launched a legacy of horror, &amp;quot;The Wolfman&amp;quot; brings the myth of a cursed man back to its iconic origins. Oscar® winner Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, a haunted nobleman lured back to his family estate after his brother vanishes. Reunited with his estranged father (Oscar® winner Anthony Hopkins), Talbot sets out to find his brother... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lawrence Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fiancée, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline (Hugo Weaving) has come to investigate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he pieces together the gory puzzle, he hears of an ancient curse that turns the afflicted into werewolves when the moon is full. Now, if he has any chance at ending the slaughter and protecting the woman he has grown to love, Talbot must destroy the vicious creature in the woods surrounding Blackmoor. But as he hunts for the nightmarish beast, a simple man with a tortured past will uncover a primal side to himself... one he never imagined existed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>22</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275960636000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259698991000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Wolfman</name><id>11992580</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266015600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/11992580/</event_url></item>
