We will have about a 30-45 minute training session on the art of canvassing.  We'll also touch on why this is a vital part of the campaign and why Ron Paul can't win NH without it!  We will be holding these events every Friday night at 7pm at Borders Books in Nashua off of the DW Highway.  Please plan on making at least one training event if you would like to Canvass for Ron Paul.  If you can't make Friday nights, we can always do a quickie before you start your route on Saturday morning.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542338000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191868563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nashua Canvassing Training</name><id>6512148</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192834800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6512148/</event_url></item>
