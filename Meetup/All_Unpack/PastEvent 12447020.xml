Why? Because as children get older, they want to make more and more decisions on their own. This natural progression towards independence is healthy, but it also often sets the stage for a battle of wills when it comes to potty training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact: Babies will potty train at the age parents expect them to train. Historical and cross-cultural practices clearly demonstrate that babies can train as early as 5 months. Training a baby that young is indeed possible, but very time-intensive. Because of the time commitment required, this approach is not practical for most parents. The Baby Signs® Potty Training Program, however, provides a compelling alternative to very early or very late potty training. By helping babies learn simple potty-time signs, the Baby Signs® Potty Training Program makes it easy for parents to both begin and end the whole enterprise before age 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of this exciting new program:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   1. Easier for You&lt;br /&gt;   2. Fun for Your Child&lt;br /&gt;   3. Good for Your Child’s Development&lt;br /&gt;   4. Good for The Environment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about Baby Signs® classes and products, &lt;a href="http://pottytrainwithbabysigns.com" target="_blank"&gt;our website!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula Penna</member_name><member_id>8325760</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268669582000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1316784</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Greater Hartford Area  Parents Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264656381000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potty Party (Potty Training How-To's)</name><id>12447020</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268496000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group/events/12447020/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/7/global_12830679.jpeg</photo_url></item>
