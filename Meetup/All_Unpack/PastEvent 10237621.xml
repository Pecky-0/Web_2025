Interested in learning more about how to lobby for the environment? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sierra Club Greater Boston Group will be hosting a workshop to explain the legislative process and how you can make a difference for the environment. The presentation will cover the legislative process including: how a bill is filed; legislative hearings and how to testify; and moving bills through the hearing process, contacting your elected officials successfully; and how to use the media to advance environmental issues. You will also learn about the Sierra Club's legislative priorities for 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening entrance to the Sierra Club Office is 294 Washington St., across from the Border's Bookstore, Downtown Boston.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be standing by the coffee pot, trying to figure out how to make coffee.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary Ann!</member_name><member_id>618637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241821281000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Environmental Activists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Sierra-Club</urlname><id>229402</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Sierra Club Environmental Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240355839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lobby for the Environment Workshop </name><id>10237621</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241562600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Sierra-Club/events/10237621/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/3/global_7614675.jpeg</photo_url></item>
