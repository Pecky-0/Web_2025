It's a Mexican joint, with plenty of Vegi/Vegan options if that's your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the meeting agenda - I thought we'd talk about the various editors that you and your contributors use to create content. The development tool arena is bursting with commercial and open source competitors, from the heavyweights like Dreamweaver and FrotPage to the underdogs like Nvu and Aptana to the vanilla text editors like Notepad, BBEdit and EditPlus. Which do you use? Which do you support? Which would you bury in a deep, deep, dark, dark, deep, dark pit if only your users would stop buying it? Come discuss, learn, rant and vent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lunch-hour meeting so bring your appetite - you can buy lunch  or brown-bag it. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://tny.se/41Z" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tny.se/41Z" target="_blank"&gt;http://tny.se/41Z...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Shearer</member_name><member_id>1529786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540373000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Web Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>webdesign-410</urlname><id>272511</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Providence Web Development Lunch Hour Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152810428000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Providence Intranet Developers Group August Meetup</name><id>5022422</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1155830400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/webdesign-410/events/5022422/</event_url></item>
