DARTMOUTH THEATER DEPARTMENT HAIRSPRAY Carol Dunne, director Music by Marc Shaiman Lyrics by Scott Wittman &amp;amp; Marc Shaiman Book by Mark O&amp;#146;Donnell &amp;amp; Thomas Meehan Hairspray sweeps audiences away to 1960s Baltimore, where loveable plus-size heroine Tracy Turnblad has a passion for dancing and wins a spot on the local TV dance program. Overnight she finds herself transformed from outsider to teen celebrity. Can she manage to vanquish the program&amp;#146;s reigning princess and find true love without mussing her hair? Tickets are $19. $17, and $15. I will buy my ticket tomorrow (Wednesday) afternoon because tickets seem to be selling pretty well.
