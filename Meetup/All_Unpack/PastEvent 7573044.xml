<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>By the time the meeting takes place we should have at least some tentative results regarding our second investigation, and will be putting together the group for investigation #3. Remember, we don't add investigators to anything without having met them face to face first, so if you haven't been to one of these socials yet, try to get there. And, did I mention that Biddy Mulligan's also has an alleged ghost? Several former employees now have related odd feelings and experiences in connection with Biddy's basement. If we're lucky and the manager is around, we might even get the go-ahead to make this place investigation #4 or #5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Mike Stevens attends (or drops it off beforehand), we're likely to have a petition circulating that will be of special interest to those of you who are particularly interested in UFO phenomena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the *best* reason to attend is to hang out with fellow paranormalists, chat, and have fun among like-minded people... See y'all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy who looks like my picture. You'll know I'm there because I'll park my van in the street in front (White Ford w/ a 17' yellow kayak tied to the roof), and I'll leave my name at the bar in case you can't find me easily.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208658142000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206058226000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group April Meeting</name><id>7573044</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208473200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/7573044/</event_url></item>
