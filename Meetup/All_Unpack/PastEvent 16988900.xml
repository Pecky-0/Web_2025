It does have a couple of short steep sections but all in all,  this is a great hike if you want to get a little more cardio than a walk in the woods....and the views are really spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan on at least 3 hours for the hike, bring a lunch and plenty of water for you and your dog.   If the temperature is in the 60's to 70's,   bring at least 32 ounces of water.   If it is warmer than this,   bring at least 48 ounces of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking poles will really help your knees on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can either take 93 North (from the Manchester/Concord areas)  to Route 3 and Route 11 (directions from Google Maps when click on link for event location at top of this page)...or you can take  Route 28 (from Hooksett NH area)  to Alton bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trailhead is 4 miles north of the southern end of Lake Winnepesauke on Route 11.   &lt;br /&gt;Big parking lot up slight hill just off route 11.  Can't miss the parking lot.....it's very visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be nice to have a pot-luck picnic at the summit.  So when you rsvp,  please be sure to answer the questions so we know who is bringing what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights:  Cliffs, Scenic view of Lake Winnipesaukee   &lt;br /&gt;Near: Alton Bay, NH    &lt;br /&gt;Distance: 3.8 miles round trip   &lt;br /&gt;Elevation Gain: 1124 ft   &lt;br /&gt;Hike Time: 2.5 to 3.0 hours    &lt;br /&gt;Difficulty: Moderate  (due to steep sections)&lt;/p&gt;
