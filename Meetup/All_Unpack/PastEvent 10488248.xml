From a cartoon from the 80's!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will see the 7:15 movie. I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the meeting place is different than usual, since this is an event movie and there may be a big crowd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing my red meetup hat, and I will be &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;in line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for the movie seating. If the movie is downstairs, the line is past the concession stand at the back of the theater. If the movie is upstairs, the line is usually in the big hallway that leads to the theaters.  If in doubt, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;ask the theater personnel for the line for the 7:15 Transformers show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and then look for me and my red meetup hat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, by chance, there is no line, I'll just be outside the theater doors. The theater showing the film, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to be in line by 6:15. Come and join me! It looks like we don't have too many folks coming, so I don't think we'll get complaints about line cutting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the highly-anticipated &amp;quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,&amp;quot; debuting June 24, 2009, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) again joins with the Autobots® against their sworn enemies, the Decepticons®. Michael Bay directs from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger &amp;amp; Roberto Orci &amp;amp; Alex Kurtzman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trailer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, youtube won't let me &amp;quot;embed&amp;quot; the trailer, so you have to click on the link...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb2fUOW1ne4" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See meetup description for how to find me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frederick Hill</member_name><member_id>4478749</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246617135000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243273098000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen</name><id>10488248</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246140900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/10488248/</event_url></item>
