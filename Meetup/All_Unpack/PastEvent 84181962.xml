As Sojourners CEO Jim Wallis puts it, "more and more of our friends are in poverty — in the pews, in our workplaces — through no fault of their own, and they are slipping below the poverty level." &lt;br /&gt;

In the Chicago suburbs, a single dad was laid off from his bank and is now a regular at the local food pantry, trying to make it by with three kids. &lt;br /&gt;

On Chicago's west side, deep poverty creates a culture of violence and hopelessness. &lt;br /&gt;

On the Gulf Coast, a fisherman struggles post-BP oil spill and Hurricane Katrina because environmental crises mean the loss of his livelihood. &lt;br /&gt;

In North Carolina, we see that hard work and determination don't always mean success. &lt;br /&gt;

What does this mean for the future of our country? How do real-life stories change the narrative about poverty? &lt;br /&gt;

What can we do about it? &lt;br /&gt;

If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you! These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It's also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that's truly helping the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349232356000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348674690000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Very Special Feature - The Line - Poverty in America</name><id>84181962</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349220600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/84181962/</event_url></item>
