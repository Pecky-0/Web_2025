Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 200 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 8:15 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 8:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have): &lt;br /&gt;From I-91:&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 10&lt;br /&gt;* Get onto Route 40 connector &amp;amp; stay on until the end&lt;br /&gt;* At the light, take a right onto Route 10 North&lt;br /&gt;* Drive 1.5 mi. &amp;amp; turn right onto Mt Carmel Ave.&lt;br /&gt;* Hike is .5 mi. down on the left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Wilbur Cross Parkway:&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 61&lt;br /&gt;* Go north onto Whitney Ave. for 3 mi.&lt;br /&gt;* Take a right onto MT.
