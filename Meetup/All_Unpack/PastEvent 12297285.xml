It's right in the center of town on the ocean. You can't miss it, or just ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENE: &lt;br /&gt;HAWTHORNE BY THE SEA MAY BE THE BEST VIEW YOU MAY EVER SEE FROM A RESTAURANT. It's that simple. It overlooks...everything: long beach, ocean, distant views of Boston, lighthouses... simply gorgeous. I always go there for my most important business celebrations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER: This is more of a travel session, so please pack light, ideally nothing more than a 9x12 sketchbook. Dry media is strongly preferred, unless you are accustomed to working with brush in small settings. Also, expect that we will converse while we sketch, unlike most BPAAG meet-ups.  We will be on the lounge side, so a drink plus a light snack is all that we need purchase to be decent patrons. It is an elegant place so feel free to dress up a bit if you so choose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call me. Save the number below (I myself always forget to do that, then I get there, and I'm clueless what the number was :) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266261308000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263304119000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INDOOR SKETCH GET-TOGETHER: Hawthorne by the Sea, Swampscott</name><id>12297285</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266087600000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/12297285/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/1/b/global_12503659.jpeg</photo_url></item>
