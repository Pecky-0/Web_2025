We are all associated with EICSL! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incorporated in 1953, the Eastern Inter-Club Ski League (EICSL) promotes recreational skiing, boarding and racing at the amateur and club level. We are an organization of ski clubs of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, most with ski lodges in the Mount Washington Valley area. The clubs offer year-round sporting and social activities individually and through the league in addition to skiing and winter outings. There are a wide variety of membership options available for singles, couples and families among the clubs. Members benefits include discounts on lift tickets, food, clothing, equipment and travel not only though EICSL, but through our membership in the National Ski Council Federation. &lt;br /&gt;EICSL website&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at a table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mags</member_name><member_id>5575742</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238233399000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237812672000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Getting to know EICSL</name><id>10014775</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238018400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/10014775/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/a/global_7826154.jpeg</photo_url></item>
