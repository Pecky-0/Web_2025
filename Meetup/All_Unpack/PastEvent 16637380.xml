This is the largest Singles  Dances in NH, with between 200 and 400 singles, in a ballroom setting,  not a Bar. Yet, it is not a ballroom dance. Meet and dance with the most  tasteful variety of people and ages you will find anywhere. Because of  the popularity of this Dance. Tables and seats are hard to hold, much  past 8:30. Parking is also limited to only around 250 to 300 cars. So,  bring your walking shoes. If you are late. Plus, the Cover Charge goes  from $12 to $15 after 9 pm. Please get there before or as close to 8 pm  as possible. So, you can meet some new people.  Steve O. will do his  best to introduces you to everyone at our tables.. If you get there  late? Introduction become very difficult. Because there is no one at out  tables. Because they are all dancing. Also, as you pay at the door, ask  where Steve O., meetup, or PWP is sitting. They will show you where our  tables are.  &lt;br /&gt;, www.togethernh.com/singlesevents.html&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Steve O. or Meetup at the door as you pay.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299433016000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1298240642000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Castleton Singles Dance</name><id>16637380</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299286800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/16637380/</event_url></item>
