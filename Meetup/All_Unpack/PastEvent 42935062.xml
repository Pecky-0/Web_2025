<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Michelle Williams is rumored to be generating Oscar buzz for her leading role in &lt;em&gt;My Week with Marilyn&lt;/em&gt;, so now I'm curious. There are some big names playing some big names in this movie: Kevin Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier, Julia Ormond as Vivian Leigh. Judi Dench has a supporting role, and from what I saw in the movie trailer, I'm betting that she has the best line in the entire film. Should be an interesting take on silver screen history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****From the theater website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the early summer of 1956, twenty-three-year-old Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) came down from Oxford determined to make his way in the film business. He worked as a lowly assistant on the set of the &lt;em&gt;The Prince and the Showgirl&lt;/em&gt;, the film that famously united Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) and Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), who was also on honeymoon with her new husband, the playwright Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott). Nearly forty years on, Clark's diary account, &lt;em&gt;The Prince, the Showgirl, and Me&lt;/em&gt; was published, but one week was missing, and this was published some years later as &lt;em&gt;My Week with Marilyn&lt;/em&gt;. This is the story of that week. When Arthur Miller leaves England, the coast is clear for Colin to introduce Marilyn to some of the pleasures of British life -- an idyllic week in which he escorted a Monroe desperate to get away from her retinue of Hollywood hangers-on and the pressures of work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will purchase my ticket at about 6:30, then wait at the foot of the stairs in the theater lobby. Look for me and my bright red backpack. At about 6:45 p.m., I will move into the theater auditorium. You can find me there if you are late. &lt;strong&gt;The movie starts at 7:05.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the movie, I will wait in the theater lobby to gather everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please RSVP if you plan to attend this event so I know who to look for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
