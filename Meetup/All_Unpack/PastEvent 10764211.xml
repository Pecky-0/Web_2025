We strongly suggest that you take the time to go to the following &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; resources to learn about Abraham Hicks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) &amp;quot;About Abraham Hicks: the Teachings in Brief&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/teachings_brief.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.abraham-hi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) &amp;quot;Introduction to Abraham Hicks&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/mp3downloads.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.abraham-hi...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Free Video Clips on LOA by Abraham Hicks&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/videos.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.abraham-hi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; ONLY if you know you are coming!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some light snacks &amp;amp; refreshments will be provided. &lt;br /&gt;To help keep the cost down, please RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; only when you can honor your commitment &amp;amp; show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 7 - 9 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Arlington Heights (will be provided)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shannon Brophy and Lidia Scher, BostonLOA members and &amp;quot;Abraham&amp;quot; enthusiasts&lt;/b&gt;, look forward to facilitating our continuing practice of the Abraham-Hicks materials. Come to share, have fun, raise vibration and focus &amp;quot;downstream&amp;quot; to a more joyful, fulfilling life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month we will continue referring to the &lt;b&gt;Emotional Guidance System&lt;/b&gt; as we examine &lt;b&gt;current vibrational patterns&lt;/b&gt; and determine how they &lt;b&gt;align with our desires to attract money and manifest abundance&lt;/b&gt;. We will learn a nifty tool to help us maximize our vibrational escrow, reframe thoughts that do not serve us and create a new working paradigm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will listen to one question from an Abraham-Hicks workshop regarding Abundance to appreciate how Abraham guides the questioner to create a new story about money and abundance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of us will personally work with the process of &lt;b&gt;“Telling a New Story about Abundance, Money and Financial Well Being”&lt;/b&gt;.  We will first sample some of the old stories we tell ourselves and then move on to create a new story from the perspective of what we desire rather than from the perspective of what we are actually currently living, thus our patterns will shift and so will our point of attraction.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be molding the clay here, focusing downstream on positive thoughts that feel better and having fun with our individual desires……as Abraham says, &amp;quot;We are always evolving so you never get it wrong because you never get it done!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Please bring a notebook or notepad and a few pens for the exercises. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Also bring your reading glasses if you need them and your openness to participate fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No shoes are worn in Lidia's home, so bring along your socks or house slippers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chew-Hoong</member_name><member_id>3101506</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248820182000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Law of Attraction Co-Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lawofattraction-us</urlname><id>368525</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246316217000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Abraham Hicks Practice Group: Create a New Story to Attract Money</name><id>10764211</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248217200000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lawofattraction-us/events/10764211/</event_url></item>
