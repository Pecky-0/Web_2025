 The presentation will be conducted by the Society's regional field director Hal Shurtleff. Since June of last year, Mr. Shurtleff has conducted close to 70 presentations on this subject in the Northeast and Midwest. He will give the history of Agenda 21, how it is being implemented, and how to stop it. He points out that Keene is promoting Agenda 21 directly by its membership of the International Council on Local Environmental Initiative that was set up by the United Nations. while Plan NH is more subtle. It conducts "visionary sessions" in New Hampshire towns to implement the goals of Agenda 21. Plan NH recently conducted its sessions in Rindge and Troy and have one schedueld for Swanzey. &lt;br /&gt;
