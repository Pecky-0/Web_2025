The cusisine is Afghani (which resembles Pakistani) and delicious.  Menu is diverse.  The prices are ridiculously low, $12-19 for entrees.  Ambience is appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you must cancel, be sure to do so by internet at least twelve hours in advance, or else by phone (781)643-0130.  Please don't be a no-show as there are consequences, and not just to your kharma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closest T stop is Lechmere (Green Line).  Parking takes a little hunting.  The abandoned mini-lot immediately across the side street is fair game (I've used it many times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Harold&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the hostess for the Meetup group.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Harold</member_name><member_id>5109349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202861970000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><why>The Helmand is unique in Boston.
