A change of clothes in a waterproof bag is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the put-in at 10:30 AM. The Farmington River is west of Hartford. We will shuttle as soon after as ready to the take-out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put-In: From Route I-84 take exit 39 (Not exit 39A)and head west on Route 4 for about 2 miles. Put-in is on the left just after crossing the river. The road down to the parking area is hard to spot and looks like just a missing piece of guard rail until you are right across from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put-in: GPS coordinates: 41ยบ 43? 41.0? N by - 72ยบ 49? 46.0&amp;quot; W&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AutoNav GPS Address is 880 Farmington Ave, Farmington CT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Farmington is a very pretty leisurely wide low current river that meanders through the countryside with overhanging trees. Points of interest include The Heublein Tower. They say you can see all the way to Long Island Sound from the tower on a clear day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King Phillip Mountain is on the right just before the take out. King Phillip?s Cave will be due west about half way up the mountain. The large cave is visible from the river. At the take out there are two very large sycamore trees in this small park. The plaque by one of the trees gives a little history of the park.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Shaved head, 5'9" 200 pounds.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211812873000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Very scenic river meandering through the wooded country side.</why><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209412457000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Farmington River - Farmington CT</name><id>7829415</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211639400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/7829415/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/c/global_3957212.jpeg</photo_url></item>
