Unique to The Joshua Tree is their dedication to the entire U2 songbook, including early fan favorites from the 1980-1987 period (Boy, October, War, The Unforgettable Fire, and The Joshua Tree).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing each song with the same intensity and emotion, the band covers all phases of U2?s career from their first album Boy to the most recent, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joshuatreeband.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.joshuatree...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet me by the bar, or call me at 440.867.6156</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204078164000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Because you'll have an enjoyable evening</why><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203423035000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>U2 Tribute - The Joshua Tree</name><id>7361374</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203733800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/7361374/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/0/2/global_3272306.jpeg</photo_url></item>
