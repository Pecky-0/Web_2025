&lt;p&gt;In Breakfast of Champions, one of Kurt Vonnegut&amp;#146;s&amp;nbsp; most beloved characters, the aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. What follows is murderously funny satire, as Vonnegut looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution in America and reminds us how to see the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years&amp;#151;as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues&amp;#151;Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
