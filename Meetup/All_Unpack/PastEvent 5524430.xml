This will be a great opportunity to see some of the amazing collections and hang out afterwards for refreshments.  The cost will be $15 per head, which covers entry into the museum and the First Friday event, food and beverages not included.  This will be another joint event with the Boston Canadian meetup group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the plan is to meet at the main entrance on Huntington Ave between 6:30 and 6:45 PM. After that we can go our separate ways, have a wander through the museum and then reconvene at the Koch Gallery at 8:30pm to catch the last hour of the drinks, food and music. Depending on the vibe we may head out somewhere else nearby after the museum closes at around 9:30 PM. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176823052000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172715098000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MFA First Friday</name><id>5524430</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175898600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/5524430/</event_url></item>
