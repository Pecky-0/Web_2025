The Basterds soon cross paths with a Jewish teenage girl (whose family was exterminated by the Nazis) who works at a movie theater in Paris - owned by a kindly old lady who has taken her in - which is targeted by the soldiers. The girl finds herself in a unique situation when an infatuated German war hero persuades his superiors to screen their latest propaganda film at her theatre. Will she seek revenge? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click for trailer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sQhTVz5IjQ" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>29</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253874669000</updated><rating><average>3.8599998951</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>37</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246455004000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quentin Tarantino's movie "Inglorious Bastards,"</name><id>10777960</id><headcount>38</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250989200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/10777960/</event_url></item>
