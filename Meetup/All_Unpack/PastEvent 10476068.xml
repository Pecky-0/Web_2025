We would love to play with labs, shepards, mixes and other friendly pooches that won't feel intimidated by a scardy-cat rottweiler who just wants to understand what these other dogs are doing! because of her uncertainty, isabelle acts like a tough guy so she can make the first move, instead of worry about the other dog scaring her first.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we would love to meet for a walk around the big field and take our time to be social and get to know each other over a period of time.  isabelle does not make friends instantly, but once she does, look out!  she would romp right all over any human that gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Near the pavillion in the middle of the park</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>melissa </member_name><member_id>7279035</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1244313266000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243084578000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Big Dog Meet Up</name><id>10476068</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244069100000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10476068/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/d/global_8675469.jpeg</photo_url></item>
