It runs about an hour and some. There are 4-6 performers telling 5-8 minute stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest this:&lt;br /&gt;Stripped Stories on March 19th at 8pm&lt;br /&gt;At Mottley's Comedy Club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mottleyscomedy.com/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mottleysco...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.strippedstories.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.strippedst...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is awesome and fun though a little racy. Be forewarned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest this: (it's at 8, see this show and then come see my show. Crazy story packed night!)&lt;br /&gt;Mortified&lt;br /&gt;TIME: 8:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;VENUE: Mottleys Comedy Club @ Trinity&lt;br /&gt;ADDRESS: 61 Chatham Street, 02109&lt;br /&gt;This show is awesome, see it anytime you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother Blue&lt;br /&gt;Brother Blue and his wife Ruth host open mic storytelling every Tuesday night in Sherrill Hall of the Harvard Episcopal Divinity School, 99 Brattle Street, Cambridge, at 7:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;You can also see him sometimes on CCTV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all great shows to check out!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm hosting</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess</member_name><member_id>7409085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244161175000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>storytellers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>storytelling-28</urlname><id>1247871</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Greater Boston and MA Storytelling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236285781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tonight and other Suggestions!</name><id>9890092</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236308400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/storytelling-28/events/9890092/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/e/global_5060862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
