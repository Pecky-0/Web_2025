Carrigain via Signal Ridge Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Looks like Sawyer River Road is finally open!!!  That saves us 4 miles! &lt;br /&gt;

 10 miles total, 7.5 hours, 3642' elevation gain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several water crossings and a couple of river crossings which may be difficult at high water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like there may be 1/2" of snow the night before and the temperature on the summit will be in the low 30s all day (50 degrees at the base), so be sure to bring something warm for the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions to Parking Lot from Concord, NH: &lt;br /&gt;

 I-93 N about 73.8 mi &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a trained guide or medical person. I am just a hiker looking for others to join me on the trail. By signing up for this hike, you agree that you will be responsible for your own safety, and will hold me harmless for any personal damage, injury and/or death that occurs in relation to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please only sign up if you know you can hike this kind of distance and elevation gain at least at book time speed. The days are shorter now, so we don't have a lot of extra time to make it out before dark.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349743785000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349567147000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Hike Carrigain on Columbus Day (Moderate/Advanced)</name><id>85834962</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>27000000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349699400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/85834962/</event_url></item>
