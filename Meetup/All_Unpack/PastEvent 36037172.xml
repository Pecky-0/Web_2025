&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Company&amp;rdquo; follows thirty-something bachelor Robert as he navigates his way through scene after hilarious scene with his several different girlfriends &amp;ndash; April (the ditzy stewardess), Kathy (the sweet girl-next-door), and Marta (the assertive "artsy" one) &amp;ndash; and his best friends &amp;ndash; five married couples &amp;ndash; who each cause him to reevaluate his stubbornly single life, and the pros and cons of fully committing to another person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets get together later and talk about the&amp;nbsp; show over a drink at a local pub!&lt;/p&gt;
