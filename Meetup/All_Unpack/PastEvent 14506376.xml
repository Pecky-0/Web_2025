He has published over 200 peer-reviewed articles and has won numerous awards for his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanins are pigments in the skin that play many roles in biology including camouflage, species and gender recognition, heat exchange, and protection from ultraviolet light. The more melanin you have in your skin, the less sun damage. While there are many beneficial roles for melanin, unfortunately the amount and distribution of skin melanin can cause some people to be perceived as “different” from the rest of society, evoking negative discrimination against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start with a half hour of coffee and conversation at 7:30 p.m. and the main talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about this event and others, please read the write-up on &lt;a href="http://www.cthumanist.org/" target="_blank"&gt;our home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285117797000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282524783000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting: John Pawelek on “The Colors of our Skin”</name><id>14506376</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285025400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/14506376/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/global_5196186.jpeg</photo_url></item>
