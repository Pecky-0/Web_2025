<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I won't lead a morning hike this weekend due of other events but after a weekend of debauchery I would love to hit the trails before starting the work week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to hike the red loop on the eastern side of the Blue Hills. We will meet at the parking area by the corner of Route 28 and Chickatawbut Road. The Road is closed to vehicles on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 3 miles&lt;br /&gt;Time: 2.25 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunset is at 7:33 which should give us plenty of time at a moderate pace with the occasional scrambling. Please be prepared to pick up the pace if need. This is a hike off any paved road and I want to be safely back before it gets dark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;Bring plenty of water for you and your dog. &lt;br /&gt;Bug spray - unless you're really brave. &lt;br /&gt;Proper footwear - unless you like to suffer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parking area is not huge so please try to be a little early. If there is trouble parking we can also park a little down the road on 28; and shuttle people and pets if need. Please feel free to call me if have trouble finding us. My number is 508-510-1136.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will wait until 4:05 for people running late but please be considerate of the group. If you would like to send me your number I will call you if the parking situation is tough and coordinate accordingly - we can always block each other in.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Green Chevy Pickup</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251502271000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250776453000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Afternoon in the Blue Hills</name><id>11156384</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251057600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/11156384/</event_url></item>
