What is it that our loved ones really want to say to us after they’ve passed on from this physical body?  Through stories, experiences and concepts Beau will lead guests through a night that will leave each guest with answers to their burning questions about the other side as well as many ideas to ponder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner is two courses at the acclaimed Blue Mermaid Island Grill in historic downtown Portsmouth.&lt;br /&gt;Please join us!&lt;br /&gt;Location -  Blue Mermaid Island Grill, 4009 The Hill, Portsmouth, New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;Date - Sunday, December 6th, 2009&lt;br /&gt;Time - 6:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;Cost - $40 (includes your event ticket, meal, tax and gratuities)&lt;br /&gt;*alcohol and desert not included&lt;br /&gt;This Intimate Evening is limited to 14 people, seating will fill quickly so it is highly recommended that you register to guarantee yourself a seat&lt;br /&gt;Register now by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.isabeauesby.com/Isabeau_Esby/Appearances.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.isabeauesby.com/Isabeau_Esby/Appearances.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.isabeauesb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, calling Chris Roy at 603-973-2317 or emailing isabeauesby@me.com &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabeau Esby</member_name><member_id>5847842</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260313630000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259252206000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Intimate Evening with Isabeau Esby - Internationally Renowned Psychic Medium</name><id>11959667</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260140400000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/11959667/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/3/global_6795651.jpeg</photo_url></item>
