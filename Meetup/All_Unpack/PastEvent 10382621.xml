Thanks and keep them coming.  Since someone suggested going to Bloodroot and since I was going to be in Bridgeport that morning anyway this works out for me.  I hope it works for you too.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not don't worry I will scheduling a few more events in June because alot of stuff seems to be going on then.  Also keep an eye on the message boards and calendar as I will be updating that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there &lt;br /&gt;Ben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloodroot.com/hours_directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bloodroot....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a "Hello, I'm the Vegan" sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben Martin</member_name><member_id>1315927</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243637150000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-386</urlname><id>279146</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242009357000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May Meetup at Bloodroot</name><id>10382621</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243179000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-386/events/10382621/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/8/a/global_1616698.jpeg</photo_url></item>
