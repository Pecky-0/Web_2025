<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This hike will take 5.0 miles and climb about 1,300 feet and take us through three different states (MA, CT, and NY) as we climb Round Mountain (CT), Mount Frissell (MA), Brace Mountain (NY), and South Brace Mountain (NY). Along the way we will get to first stand atop CT's State Highpoint (southwest shoulder of Mount Frissell) and then stand on the spot where MA/CT/NY all come together. This is a moderate pace hike that should take about 4 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be joining the &amp;quot;Random Group of Hikers&amp;quot; meetup out of Boston with Michael Blair leading his contingent for this trip (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/305/calendar/13152283/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cotton is acceptable for this hike. Hiking boots required. Hiking poles are advised. Please dress in layers and bring plenty of water and food containing protein and carbohydrates. Make sure to have a windbreaker or hiking raincoat to keep warm in windy conditions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to approximate meetup location at parking area on west shoulder of Mt.
