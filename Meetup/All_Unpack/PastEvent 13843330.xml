Its always crowded on the weekend mornings with lines out the door! However, they also do dinner and sport a bevy of interesting beverages of all kinds. There is definitely something for everyone! We'll gather at the bar, but I also understand there is an outdoor space in the back (table service only), and I have it on the QT that the Scrabble group meets there on Monday nights....Sounds like fun! So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a scarf of some kind - I think, but we're hard to miss and very friendly!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
