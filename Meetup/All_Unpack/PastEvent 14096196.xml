Lessons start at 7:30 and dancing starts at 8:30 and ends at 11pm rain or shine.  The attire is casual, but having gone to a swing dance lesson before, I suggest flats or low heels for the ladies.  Light snacks will be provided.  This is a fun way to learn something new and help the Community Boating House raise money for their renovations.  It is $10 per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address is 21 David G. Mugar Way, Boston, MA 02114.  It is easy to get to, just take the red line to Charles/MGH or take the green line to Arlingon.  You can also park at the Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary and purchase a $5 parking validation in the front office.  Community Boating is located on the Charles River Esplanade, between teh hatch Shell and the Longfellow Bridge.  We can meet just outside the boat house and go in together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the website www.community-boating.org for more information on Community Boating.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In front of the boat house.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tammy </member_name><member_id>7303013</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280018277000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279074194000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swinging on the Charles</name><id>14096196</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280014200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/14096196/</event_url></item>
