(formerly the Playwright)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 9pm, hang-out, and at some point get dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dance room is supposed to open at 9, if you're definitely coming and aren't too shy to &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; a dance floor, I'm happy to meet earlier (8pm?), and get dancing sooner.  Let me know, I'll change the Meetup time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be no cover earlier in the night, definitely one as the night goes on.  Later in the night, if it gets packed, they may increase the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music at Wicked Wolf is usually like what you'd hear on 101.3FM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DINNER/BAR CRAWL BEFORE?&lt;/b&gt;  I probably can't, but if someone else wants to host a restaurant or bars outing, I'll make another Event and we'll sync-up.  If no one plans this, I MAY end up downtown earlier to eat anyway.  If you want to join, email me your cell and I'll text you if that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO FIND US:&lt;/b&gt; We may hang-out in front first.  Regardless, just text me when you're close to the venue to give some time for me to notice your text.  If it helps, I'm tall (6'3&amp;quot;).  Maybe I'll wear a light-up necklace.  I'll try to update this with new details (&amp;amp; send a message) as the date gets closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; Jason, cell 203-901-4957 (noisy club, texting probably best)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARKING:&lt;/b&gt; I always find free street parking easily northeast of the green...Temple St, Grove St, etc.  Or look at New Haven's parking garage map &lt;a href="http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/ParkingAuthority/images/map.gif" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Text me when you're close to arriving (203-901-4957).
