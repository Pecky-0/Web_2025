We will set up routes on easy climbs and give new climbers a bit of time on the rope.  I will also try to teach you how to tie the figure 8.  It's a bit like learning how to tie y'r shoes.  &lt;br /&gt;Bring any climbing equipment that you might have. &lt;br /&gt;We will then go swim at Houghton Pond.  Please call me if you have any questions. 617 501-6217  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details: Quincy Quarries has no facilities so bring water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11AM, meet at Porter Sq. Red line for car pooling to Quincy Quarries.  Meet at the big red wind mill sculpture.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 Noon, Meet at Quincy Quarries parking lot.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2PM Drive to Houghton Pond and jump in the water.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have drinks in Sommerville later in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,  Geoff&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will wear something red.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214350601000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213232331000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quincy Quarries for Newbies</name><id>8126498</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213455600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8126498/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/6/d/global_4294717.jpeg</photo_url></item>
