I will be wearing a badge so anyone new can recognize me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has been getting a lot of air time and it is opening weekend.  It is a very good idea to buy your tickets ahead of time.   I bought mine on Fandango.   Bad news there though, the $1 fee that had been waved for several months is back.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a later start time, if people are interested I am always up for a cocktail and some vittles after the flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is called Premonition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Sandra Bullock, Julian McMahon, Nia Long, Kate Nelligan, Amber Valetta, Peter Stormare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genre: Psychological Thriller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Website: '&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/premonition/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sonypictur...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) has a beautiful house, a loving husband and two adorable daughters. Her life is perfect, until the day she receives the devastating news that her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) has died in a car accident. When she wakes up the next morning to find him alive and well, she assumes it was all a dream, but is shaken by how vivid it felt. She soon realizes it wasn't a dream, and her world is turned upside down as the surreal circumstances lead her to discover that her perfect life may not have been all that it appeared. Desperate to save her family, Linda begins a furious race against time and fate to try and preserve everything that she and Jim have built together.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174348053000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171781967000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Premonition</name><id>5491174</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174175100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5491174/</event_url></item>
