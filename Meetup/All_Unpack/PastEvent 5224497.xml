This 883 acre park passes thru 3 towns, and spreads over fields and dense woodlands with 5 ponds! There are many interesting things to see in this park, such as the great vistas (yes more than one), and extremely intriguing geological features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This place is so great, and I would like this to be a slow, relaxed, exploratory hike rather than a workout ;)  The route I planned is approx 5 miles.  There are many cut throughs that can make the hike shorter or longer depending on what you guys would like to do, but the terrain is not treatcherous!  Beginners will have no trouble keeping up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring water, and a snack.  Although we will be taking it slow, we will get hungry out there! If you have a camera, bring that too because there is so much beauty to be captured here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Amanda (203) 209-7779&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1162924720000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1161882389000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at the Magical Collis P Huntington State Park!!</name><id>5224497</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1162751400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5224497/</event_url></item>
