&lt;p&gt;If you can't make the rehearsal there will be another one. You may want to pick a buddy if you can't make it to practice with. 2nd rehearsal is March 16th @ 2:00, performance date is April 6th @ 1:00. If you can't make it to the performance, it is okay as I think we may do this at other locations throughout the year. It would be great if you could learn the routine in order to participate in future flash mobs. Let's have some fun! That's what I call entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in our lives &lt;br /&gt;

 We all have pain &lt;br /&gt;

 We all have sorrow &lt;br /&gt;

 But if we are wise &lt;br /&gt;

 We know that there's always tomorrow &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Lean on me, when you're not strong &lt;br /&gt;

 And I'll be your friend &lt;br /&gt;

 I'll help you carry on &lt;br /&gt;

 For it won't be long &lt;br /&gt;

 'Til I'm gonna need &lt;br /&gt;

 Somebody to lean on &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Please swallow your pride &lt;br /&gt;

 If I have things you need to borrow &lt;br /&gt;

 For no one can fill those of your needs &lt;br /&gt;

 That you won't let show &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 You just call on me brother, when you need a hand (Chorus) &lt;br /&gt;

 We all need somebody to lean on &lt;br /&gt;

 I just might have a problem that you'd understand &lt;br /&gt;

 We all need somebody to lean on &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Second Verse &lt;br /&gt;

 (Chorus) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If there is a load you have to bear &lt;br /&gt;

 That you can't carry &lt;br /&gt;

 I'm right up the road &lt;br /&gt;

 I'll share your load &lt;br /&gt;

 If you just call me &lt;br /&gt;

 (Chorus) &lt;br /&gt;

 Call me (if you need a friend) &lt;br /&gt;

 Call me (call me) &lt;br /&gt;

 Call me (if you need a friend) &lt;br /&gt;

 Call me (if you ever need a friend) &lt;br /&gt;

 Call me (call me) &lt;br /&gt;

 Call me &lt;br /&gt;

 Call me (if you need A friend) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon fellow flash mobbers&lt;/p&gt;
