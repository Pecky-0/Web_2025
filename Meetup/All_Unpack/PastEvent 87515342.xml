 &lt;br /&gt;

We are back to winning ways with a great result against Houston, thank you to those of you who turned out last Sunday night I know it’s a difficult time with work the next day. This Sunday at 1.00pm we will be taking on the St. Louis Rams at the Edward Jones Dome, we have been getting our biggest crowds for the 1pm Sunday games so please get here early to get your seat (2nd floor will be open at 12pm), we will have the game on both floors to accommodate any overflow. We got a comment about the 2nd floor being too cold last week, this week the A/C will not be turned on, we had it on because we received comments that the room was too warm, so having said that if the temperature is not acceptable please notify a staff member and we will adjust the thermostat. Please let me know how we can service the group better, and comments or suggestions are always welcome, hope to see you on Sunday. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

One more thing, we have an opportunity to get “Packers Boston” merchandise, when I get pricing I will forward it to the group. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Go Pack, &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Ray Butler&lt;/p&gt;
