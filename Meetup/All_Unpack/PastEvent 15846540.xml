Not only was it a great fundraising event for the shelter it helped raise awareness within the community of the good work being done for those less fortunate. Since the race inception in 2003 the event has raised over $94,000 for the shelter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Irish Blessing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May you be poor in misfortune, &lt;br /&gt;rich in blessings, &lt;br /&gt;slow to make enemies, &lt;br /&gt;quick to make friends, &lt;br /&gt;but rich or poor, &lt;br /&gt;quick or slow, &lt;br /&gt;may you know nothing but happiness &lt;br /&gt;from this day forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For registration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bristolct.net/roadraces/shamrockrun.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://bristolct.net/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Sam Z!
