Cunningham Dog Park is a private Dog Park in Milton, reserved for Milton residents and their guests.  I will be bringing two residents with me, and their dogs, so we will be able to roam the trails and let our dogs play.  Parts of this park require your dog to be on a leash, but once we are on the trails it is allowed as long as they are trained.  The main trail is only about 15 minutes around, but I usually criss-cross around with Luca on the shorter loops to get a good walk in.  Bring good walking shoes - we will be on wooded trails.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet inside the park by the red barn near the parking lot.  Drive in either entrance and follow the drive to the paved parking area.  Once you see a red building, you'll know you are there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call with questions 860.729.6603&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269266987000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266098669000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cunningham Park, Milton</name><id>12598063</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269093600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/12598063/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/6/global_10816006.jpeg</photo_url></item>
