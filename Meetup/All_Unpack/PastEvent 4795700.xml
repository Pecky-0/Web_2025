For the time being, we've selected  Starbucks at 443 Boylston in Boston (at the corner of Berkeley St.) as our meet up location.   It's close to the T's Green line (Arlington Station), so hopefully it is easily accessible to most people.    This location has a great downstairs section which  usually has very few customers, save a few identity-challenged pre-teens of dubious gender who have found a secret Wi-Fi hot spot where they can look at lord-knows-what on their computers.  For our purposes, it tends to have ample seating... and great people watching if you arrive early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our loose agenda for the next meeting is to discuss a few Q&amp;amp;A from Robert Mayhew's new book, Ayn Rand Answers, which is a compilation of her answers to questions from many speaking engagements over the years.  Also, we decided to ask each member to come with a current event in mind that we can discuss from an Objectivist perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be interesting - and fun - so I hope to see you on December 4 at 5PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pay meetup.com $19.00 per month to use their site, so if anyone is willing to donate a couple of green-backs to &amp;quot;the cause&amp;quot; I'd be most grateful.  At the last meeting several people put in a voluntary contribution at the end of the gathering. Oddly enough, it had overtones of passing the collection plate at church, but I enjoy that kind of irony, so we'll probably continue to collect money in that fashion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1131318418000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand December Meetup</name><id>4795700</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1133733600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/4795700/</event_url></item>
