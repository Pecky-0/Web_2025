 &lt;br /&gt;

 The poll for this month chose &lt;span&gt;2312 by Kim Stanley Robinson for the book of the month. This book is nominated for both a Nebula and a Hugo award, so it will hopefully be good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The year is 2312. Scientific and technological advances have opened gateways to an extraordinary future. Earth is no longer humanity's only home; new habitats have been created throughout the solar system on moons, planets, and in between. But in this year, 2312, a sequence of events will force humanity to confront its past, its present, and its future.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;The first event takes place on Mercury, on the city of Terminator, itself a miracle of engineering on an unprecedented scale. It is an unexpected death, but one that might have been foreseen. For Swan Er Hong, it is an event that will change her life. Swan was once a woman who designed worlds. Now she will be led into a plot to destroy them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones and across the street from Orleans restaurant. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
