Should we see it at the Premium or at the regular Framingham 16? &lt;a href="http://movies.meetup.com/689/polls/135126/"&gt;Vote now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Old Stuff:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wedding movie ? Big (aka John) and Carrie are finally tying the knot. 4 years after the series ended, the nuptials are under way. Come see Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha in their first full-length feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't wait until June 11, the &lt;a href="http://movies.meetup.com/579/calendar/7850579/"&gt;Worcester movie meetup group is seeing this movie on Saturday, May 31 at the Westboro theater on Route 9&lt;/a&gt;. They'd love to have you! But if you can't make that show (I can't), then come join us for a Wednesday night show on the 11th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet outside the theater and then go in and buy our discounted tickets together. (Tix are $8.50 each to FMM members and their guests; instead of $10.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome. Just be sure to include them in your RSVP so I know how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go out after the movie to discuss it and chat, if people are game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell number is 508/308-4897 if you need to RSVP last minute (like w/in 2 hours of the show). The exact time of the show will be updated a few days before, as movie times don't come out this far ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My email is dana@framesbydana.com. Email me if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;?Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing my Meetup nametag and waiting outside by the parking lot.
