<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Since early 2004, The Python web development community has been consolidating around a standard deployment model in the form of WSGI (Web Services Gateway Interface), a specification which describes how servers talk to Python web applications. A packaging standard referred to loosely as &amp;quot;eggs&amp;quot; has also become popular since that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repoze (&lt;a href="http://repoze.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://repoze.org...&lt;/a&gt;) is an effort to bring Zope technologies to the larger Python web development community by breaking Zope up into pieces that fit into a WSGI deployment model and which can be installed using eggs as the basis for deployment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obverse side of this effort is that it allows current Zope users to make use of WSGI technologies for development purposes, including the ability to run Zope 2 and Plone applications under WSGI servers, including 'mod_wsgi' inside Apache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Gift from O'ReillyNet has written a nice article about these technologies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/12/wsgi_python_web_developments_h_1.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.oreillynet...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a video of their Chris and Tres' talk in Atlanta and their slides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3276625123051018943&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;http://video.google.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.repoze.org/pyatl-slides.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://static.repoze....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great opportunity to hear about this very useful technology from some of the brightest minds in the Zope/Plone community. Chris and Tres have been touring around the country evangelizing this open source middleware, and now's your chance to see them in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/2jonp9" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/2jonp9" target="_blank"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/2j...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [googlemap]&lt;br /&gt;Please note that while the official location of the church is 1 Norway Street, the meetup entrance is in the center of the long building next to the reflecting pool in the Christian Science Church Park and is closer to Huntington Ave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: If coming by T, take the green line to the Symphony stop. Hynes Convention Center is also very close, as is Mass Ave (Orange line). Metered street parking on Mass Ave is available but usually pretty tight. An underground parking garage is also available. It costs $5. Let the parking attendant know that you are here for the Plone Meetup hosted by Russ Danner. Call me (Sid) on my cell (781-254-3422) if you have trouble.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sid Koul</member_name><member_id>2310802</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mick Darling</member_name><member_id>3255622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204416148000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201223102000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone February Meetup - Repoze</name><id>7189590</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204243200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/7189590/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/1/global_3259585.jpeg</photo_url></item>
