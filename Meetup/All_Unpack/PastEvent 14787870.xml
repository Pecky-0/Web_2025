But, everyone seems to enjoy it each time. So, please bring the dogs, the kids and friends. Join Steve O. and his friends for an easy hike through 170 acres, up wooded trails.  This is Andreas' Sculpture Park with art work from sculptor from around the world all along the trails. At the top of the trail is a spot with seats and a view of Mt. Manadnock 75 miles away.  Where we can sit and have a picnic at the top of the trail. If you can not make it at 11:00 am?  Than meet us at anytime along the trail. The trail crisscrosses the main driveway to the top and the art studio. Do not drive up the driveway. We park below at the start of the paved driveway on the right. You can also just meet us for the picnic. Steve O. will have his Ceil phone on to help find us. Dress for changing weather and the woods, and remember the Deer Ticks. Bring your own lunch and drink.   This is privet property. So, what we bring into the park . We must bring out.  &lt;br /&gt;    Contact: Steve O. ob@tds.net   603-491-1962&lt;br /&gt;www.andresinstitute.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call us at anytime 603-491-1962</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284912961000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
