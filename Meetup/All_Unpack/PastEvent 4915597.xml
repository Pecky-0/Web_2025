<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 3.4 mile forested hike starting on flat topography that eventually goes up a moderate hillside and eventually back down again. We'll hike the Blue/Yellow blazed trail that loops around the park and includes a portion of the Hop River Linear Trail (i.e. Rails-To-Trails in Vernon area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the parking lot at 5 PM sharp and head out to hike the trail in a counter-clockwise direction. The hike should take about 1.5 hrs. and we should be done by 6:30 PM. There will be no meal after this hike (leader as a meeting to get to, sorry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 8.5 miles of blazed trails in the park, as well as a playground, picnic pavilion, toilet facilities and a swimming beach. Portions of the park contain riuns of textile mills and an early trout hatchery and have been declared a national historic site. The park is heavily used for swimming, picnicking, hiking, x-country skiing, fishing, wild flower &amp;amp; wildlife observation and a scenic vista.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S. is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A park map can be found in the document link.
