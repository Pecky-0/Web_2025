&lt;p&gt;I'm changing the name because I'm changing the focus. Through my own experience in singledom that past few years I've learned that both hosting and attending singles events can be an exercise in frustration and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have since learned what I've known all along. the best way to meet someone and develop a healthy relationship is to get to know them the old fashioned way. You hang out with them for a little while, become friends and take it from there. So without drabbing on about the perils of dating in the new millennium, I just wanted to let you know that I am changing the focus of the group to mimic what I have been doing on the South Shore for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see the new name above. The focus will be on hosting varied events in the Boston Metro area and beyond, with the sole purpose of having fun and making friends. You don't have to be single to be a member of the group but most of us will be and if romance happens then it's a bonus !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me be clear, this is not a dating site and I ask everyone to please be respectful and polite of the other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always looking for help hosting events and Ideas so please don't be shy. This is just as much your group as it is mine. So let's have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
