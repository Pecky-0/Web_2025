What are you going to do?! Join us on a tour of the lovely state parks that the Blackstone Valley has to offer. Every Wednesday Kyra &amp;amp; I will be journeying out to a different state park in the Blackstone Valley area (and maybe some slightly outside of the area) and would love some company! Please meet us for some on-leash (and maybe off-leash) fun. Will be weather-dependent, though Ky and I will generally go in most weather excepting blazingly hot or torrential downpours :) &lt;br /&gt;

The current plan is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 4: West Hill Dam, 518 E Hartford Ave, Uxbridge, MA [note: there is a Dam and a Park entrance...we are meeting at the Dam] &lt;br /&gt;

April 11: Riverbend Farm/Blackstone Heritage Park, 287 Oak St, Uxbridge, MA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 18: Purgatory Chasm, 198 Purgatory Rd, Sutton, MA [note: current plans are to go through the chasm - somewhat difficult hike!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 25: Upton State Park, Westborough Rd, Upton, MA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these walks are successful I will definitely add more in the area!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335454854000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334613425000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Afternoon Walks!</name><id>qdclscyqgbhc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335384000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/60850872/</event_url></item>
