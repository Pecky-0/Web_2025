In this workshop, we will learn about mulching, soil amendments, and garden clean-up that will give your edible garden a head-start for next yearâ€™s growing season!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During part of the workshop we will get hands-on and help put part of the BHS garden to bed. There will be ample time for questions and group discussion to make sure that your garden will be ready to grow come spring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructor Sadie Richards recently finished a service year with FoodCorps, a national service organization engaging students in growing school gardens, facilitating hands-on food education, and increasing student access to local fresh fruits and vegetables. She holds an MPH in environmental health and is currently working as the Massachusetts FoodCorps Fellow, supporting the state's 2nd year of FoodCorps service members.&lt;/p&gt;
