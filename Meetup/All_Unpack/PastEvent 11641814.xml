Motorcycle jackets, chaps and the like, ok because we like to shop too. &lt;br /&gt;We are looking for volunteers to help out during the day.  &lt;br /&gt;Yard sale starts at 8am and will go to about 2pm. We will donate the remaining items to the vets so if you would like your items back, please post notes on them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey Juda</member_name><member_id>9039356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256598808000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255710174000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chapter Yard sale</name><id>11641814</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256425200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/11641814/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/b/global_9177195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
