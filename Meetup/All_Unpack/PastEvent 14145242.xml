I didn't notice that the maybe option was activated when I set this up....sorry about that.   I fixed it so maybes are now allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the trailers for this movie.   Hopefully it will be a fun romp combining action and comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, since we see movies opening weekend, it is a very good idea to buy tickets ahead of time...especially if it is a big name movie. I have run a few meetups this summer where some people came, but could not get into the show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a meetup badge. Check out my picture on the meetup site, so you will recognize me. I generally get there about a half hour before the show and the group heads in for seats about 15 minutes before hand. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator and if it is downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather after the movie just outside the room where it was shown to talk about the movie a bit and get a head count of those who would like to come out for drinks, munchies and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. the WorldRelease Date: August 13, 2010 &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Universal Pictures &lt;br /&gt;Director: Edgar Wright &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Michael Bacall, Edgar Wright &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kieran Culkin, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, Alison Pill, Brandon Routh, Jason Schwartzman &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Action, Comedy &lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for stylized violence, sexual content, language and drug references) &lt;br /&gt;Official Website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottpilgrimthemovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.scottpilgr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Meet charming and jobless Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera). A bass guitarist for garage band Sex Bob-omb, the 22-year-old has just met the girl of his dreams...literally. The only catch to winning Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)? Her seven evil exes are coming to kill him. Genre-smashing filmmaker Edgar Wright (&amp;quot;Hot Fuzz,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Shaun of the Dead&amp;quot;) tells the amazing story of one romantic slacker's quest to power up with love in &amp;quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott Pilgrim has never had a problem getting a girlfriend. It's getting rid of them that proves difficult. From the girl who kicked his heart's ass--and now is back in town--to the teenage distraction he's trying to shake when Ramona rollerblades into his world, love hasn't been easy. He soon discovers, however, his new crush has the most unusual baggage of all: a nefarious league of exes controls her love life and will do whatever it takes to eliminate him as a suitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Scott gets closer to Ramona, he must face an increasingly vicious rogues' gallery from her past--from infamous skateboarders to vegan rock stars and fearsomely identical twins. And if he hopes to win his true love, he must vanquish them all before it really is game over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Meetup Badge.
