So anyone can come that means couples are also welcome. Let's get to know one another and socialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Kitty OSheas is in Boston (near Faneuil Hall) 131 State St Boston, MA 02109 617-725-0100 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kittyosheasboston.com/live/website/home.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Kitty Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd floor can hold 200 people.  There are 2 Bars upstairs, 4 huge comfy couches, AC, its own DJ area with light machine and dance floor, plus its own bathroom upstairs so we would truly have our own private party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a commitment from Kitty OSheas for 2 Bartenders at the upfront 2nd floor Bar and one Bartender in the back area 2nd floor Bar. I am ordering $150-200 worth of appetizers (Wings/veggie platter, cheeses etc) because their Kitchen is small and we will never get enough food for 200 members. I ask if you eat any of the appetizers to please throw in $5. While this is a completely free event your contribution for the eats is voluntary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS ALWAYS YOU MUST MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for all this fun Friday June 13 after work starting at 6:30 pm until closing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note : After 9PM the bar charges a mandatory $10 cover just to get in so we need to make sure members come before 9PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 9PM if we still have over 100 people upstairs we can keep the 2nd floor to ourselves all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;In other words get there before 9PM so you don't have to pay the cover and we can have the 2nd floor to ourselves.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup Groups are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New England 25+ Social Fun &lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/887/calendar/7993303/?from=list&amp;amp;offset=10"&gt;http://socialnetwork....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beantown +Beyond 20-40 Something &lt;a href="http://singles.meetup.com/1169/calendar/7993727/"&gt;http://singles.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metro Boston Active Singles 25-35 &lt;a href="http://singles.meetup.com/1884/"&gt;http://singles.meetup...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybes RSVPs will be moved to a NO RSVPs 1 week before (On June 6) the event with no exception.&lt;br /&gt;There were 140 members at the last Mix and Mingle cross Meetup party.
