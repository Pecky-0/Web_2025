Gather your master tacticians and rules experts together to kick down the dungeon doors and begin the assault! D&amp;amp;D Lair Assault is a new Wizards Play Network in-store program that pits tactically-minded players against a super challenge where the difference between victory and defeat is dependent upon your game knowledge, ability to adapt, and a little bit of luck. You'll pit your wits against some of the most difficult encounters you've ever played. Each challenge plays in just a few hours, but many will need to make more than one run at it in pursuit of victory. Each run of the lair will likely take between 2-3 hours. Players can replay the encounter as many times as they like, and indeed will need to do so if they are hoping to claim all of the recognition possible through the program. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearing Up for Danger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;em&gt;D&amp;amp;D Lair Assault&lt;/em&gt; challenge will specify a level. The third &lt;em&gt;D&amp;amp;D Lair Assault&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Tyrantclaw&lt;/em&gt;, is 6th level. Players bring characters of the challenge’s level to your scheduled event to participate. Characters higher or lower level than the challenge’s level are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use straightforward rules to equip characters for their deadly battles. Each character receives one magic item of one level higher than their level (level + 1), one of their level (level + 0), and one of one level lower than their level (level – 1). In addition, characters receive gold pieces equal to the value of one magic item of one level lower than their level (level – 1) to buy other equipment they think they’ll need. Each character may have no more than two consumable items (like potions or magic ammunition) equal to or less than the challenge’s level, and no more than one rare magic item. Note that players may equip their characters with magic items that are less than the stated levels if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to use our 6th level example above, each character would have one 7th level, one 6th level and one 5th level magic item, plus 1000 gold pieces to spend on other equipment (both mundane and magical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
