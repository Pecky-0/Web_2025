Join us to celebrate almost fifty events and hundreds of connections made since then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foggy Goggle has closed so we'll be two doors down at Lir.  Find us channeling our inner toddler in the downstairs Rec Room*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be our biggest event yet, so if you haven't tried SoJust, now is the time. &lt;i&gt;Newcomers always welcomed!&lt;/i&gt; If you've already joined us in the past, be sure to come back for the same SoJust fun!  We'll need all you SoJusters there to celebrate - and to eat up all the cupcakes on hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns? Looking for like-minded progressives to hang out with in Boston?  Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions? Join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/b&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're involved with a group or project and want to spread the word bring flyers for the free lit table - and there'll be lots of opportunity to schmooze and network!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sorry, this event is 21+ and the event is located downstairs (no elevator).&lt;br /&gt;Lir is across from the Hynes Convention Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?&lt;/b&gt; Check out our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3187615"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/photos/"&gt;past event photos&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hilary</member_name><member_id>3092728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>25</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224349632000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>37</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219067295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SoJust Turns Two!
