And while what you see is a complete surprise until the lights go down, we can tell you that last year Talk Cinema audiences were among the first to screen such notable films as &lt;i&gt;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bright Star&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Young Victoria.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Talk Cinema screenings take place on Sundays at 10am at the Coolidge. 2010 - 2011 dates are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 26&lt;br /&gt;October 10&lt;br /&gt;October 24&lt;br /&gt;November 7&lt;br /&gt;December 12&lt;br /&gt;January 16&lt;br /&gt;February 13&lt;br /&gt;March 13&lt;br /&gt;April 3&lt;br /&gt;May 1 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some selections are meant to stretch the viewer’s perspective, some are meant to expand the viewer’s geopolitical horizons, and always to inform... New cinema is viewed as a peephole into new territory, whether it is cinematic, thematic, political or geographic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is a critic: One of the program’s distinctive features is the opportunity for members to review films and to refer films to each other. This is a great way to deepen your film experience and connect with other cinephiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;John will be sipping coffee across the street at the Panera Bread starting at 9:15 am&lt;/b&gt; to meetup with folks so that we can sit together. Due to the discussion after the film, there will be no formal meetup following Talk Cinema.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If the weather is right, look for the group at a table on the patio with a Red Meetup sign as early as 9:15</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284933036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harlan Jacobson's Talk Cinema</name><id>14824728</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285509600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/14824728/</event_url></item>
