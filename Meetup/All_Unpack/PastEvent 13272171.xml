On May 8, 2010 at 7pm, Dr. Griffin will give his presentation at the Harvard Epworth United Methodist Church, 1555 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 [see the attached poster and press alert].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He will speak the truth, something the media monopoly does not provide you on the paramount issue of war. His lecture title is “Is the War in Afghanistan Justified by the Events of 9/11?” This is the last stop in his 2010, 15-city US tour which starts tonight April 23, 2010 and includes stops in the Midwest and Northeast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come and listen if you have ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy spring,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In the beginning of a change, the Patriot is a scarce man, Brave, Hated, and Scorned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his cause succeeds however, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a Patriot.”  - Mark Twain&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mark WeAreChangeBoston.org</member_name><member_id>4641561</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273532617000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272058692000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dr. David Ray Griffin Event May 8th, 7pm</name><id>13272171</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273359600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/13272171/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/global_12798054.jpeg</photo_url></item>
