 Pack a lunch, water, camera, sunscreen and a blanket we are going to explore the grounds of the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum. &lt;a href="http://www.decordova.org" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.decordova.org&lt;/a&gt; The park was established in 1950 and covers 35 acres of beautifully landscaped lawns, forests, fields, gardens, and terraces on a rolling site along the shore of Flintâ€™s Pond. There are more than 60 works to explore outside. One rule to let your kids in on: (No touching the art or climbing indoors or out, and no running in the indoor galleries). These rules are to protect the art. The museum has just completed the summer exhibitions. At the top floor the outside deck offers views the grounds and the lake, very picturesque. Rain cancels event. &lt;br /&gt;

 Located at: 51 Sandy Pond Road, Lincoln, MA 01773 &lt;br /&gt;
