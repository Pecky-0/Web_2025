We will learn what goes into getting meat to our grills and why grass fed sustainable farming gives us yummier, healthier product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;visit the Laurel Ridge website for information on the farm.  &lt;a href="http://www.lrgfb.com/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.lrgfb.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the tour we will be able to have some private time in the farm shop to buy products (meaty goodness). Be sure to bring your $$$ because you will want to take something home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at my place and carpool from there. Any of you who live closer to the farm than to my place can coordinate your own carpools and meet us there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want to get to the farm at 2:00 PM so please plan to meet at my place no later than 12:45 PM.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone of our members who have gone on a field trip can tell you they are great fun. If the weather is nice and they are open we may stop at a winery after for a tasting and mini picnic. I will keep you posted on that bit.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at my place to carpool from there. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gady</member_name><member_id>8983958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278965024000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277577832000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Laurel Ridge Farm Tour - Grass fed beef and more!</name><id>13919058</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278865800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/13919058/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/c/global_15973788.jpeg</photo_url></item>
