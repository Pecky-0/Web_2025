<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>!!Lovely Ladies!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Winter season already here and a snow blizzard behind us, why not add a little ice skating?  As one who has NEVER, EVER ice skated before, I figured a lil bruising wouldn't hurt.  As a fan of the Winter Olympics  with ice skating as one of my favoritie things to watch, and the movie, &amp;quot;The Cutting Edge&amp;quot;, I figured why not finally try to ice skate?  So I invite you to come try ice skating with me!  I will personally buy my own knee pads and hopefully invest in a butt pad before I head out to the skating pavilion.  If you are a beginner like me, well, I definately think you should do the same (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queens offers a really nice price: $8 admission and $5 for skate rentals.  They close at 8:20 p.m on fridays so I figure 6:30 would be a good time to let the bruising start!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: City Ice Pavilion&lt;br /&gt;47-32 32nd Pl&lt;br /&gt;Long Island City, NY 11101&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total cost: $13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266795377000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Madams</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Multicultural-Womens-Network</urlname><id>1530786</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Multicultural Women's Network (MWN): Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262820788000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ice Skating, Knee Pads, and Toe Picks </name><id>12245280</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266622200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Multicultural-Womens-Network/events/12245280/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/7/global_10929047.jpeg</photo_url></item>
