Lisa Kane, owner of Wags, has graciously allowed us to rent her space for the winter.  The cost of the space is $100.  We need to get at least 20 dogs to attend to keep the cost at  the $5.00 .  If we don't get 20 dogs to come,  the amount will be prorated that day to make up ( cost will go up per dog  ) the difference.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please only RSVP if you are 100% sure you can make it, as I don't want the other dog owners who come to get stuck with paying too much.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will bring the group play bag with all the wonderful toys you all contributed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone, and Maizee is looking forward to seeing all her friend again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristen :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>kristen slattery</member_name><member_id>3376041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200408876000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-MA-Pugs</urlname><id>461198</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9599990845</group_lon><name>The Northshore MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>38</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197130077000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Salem Pug January Meetup</name><id>6878154</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200150000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-MA-Pugs/events/6878154/</event_url></item>
