The movie times have not been posted yet.  As soon as they are i will send out an update.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air, Water, Earth, Fire. Four nations tied by destiny when the Fire Nation launches a brutal war against the others. A century has passed with no hope in sight to change the path of this destruction. Caught between combat and courage, Aang discovers he is the lone Avatar with the power to manipulate all four elements. Aang teams with Katara, a Waterbender, and her brother Sokka to restore balance to their war-torn world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chad</member_name><member_id>9106934</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280439729000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278436483000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Last Airbender at Plainville </name><id>14017204</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279323000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/14017204/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/8/global_5165560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
