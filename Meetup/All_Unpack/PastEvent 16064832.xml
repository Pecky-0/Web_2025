The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ” &lt;br /&gt;Irene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ This was a fun time. Alan's leadership style is loose, offering suggestions and some instruction. Nice group of people, too.”&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ It is the best drumming circle in the area! People really come together in a community, and with a community spirit. Instruments are provided if you don't have one. ... ” &lt;br /&gt;A former member&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drumconnection.com"&gt;The DrumConnection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll welcome you at the door! ...and make sure you are very comfortable.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>1328052</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296458798000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drummers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DrumConnection</urlname><id>886763</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>The Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295157136000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Drum Circle Meetup!</name><id>16064832</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296345600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DrumConnection/events/16064832/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/6/global_3485414.jpeg</photo_url></item>
