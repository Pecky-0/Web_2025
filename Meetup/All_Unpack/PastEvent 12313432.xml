The lodge is filling up fast so if you haven't made it up yet and have been thinking about it this might be the time to come up.  &lt;b&gt;For this particular weekend we are only accepting RSVP's for people who can stay 2 nights.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are located only 2 miles from Attitash and close to Wildcat, Cranmore, Black, and Bretton Woods right in the heart of North Conway and about 40 minutes from Sunday River. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lodging is $20/night and we are offering a dinner (optional) on Saturday night consisting of meatloaf with a soup, veggie, and potato's, and eggplant stacks as a veggie option.  We will also be getting a sheet cake for desert.  The charge for dinner including desert will be $16.  Please indicate in your RSVP if you would like dinner and specify meat or veggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full directions and information will be provided to those who RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign up soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come on in!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dan</member_name><member_id>8253363</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268663197000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1342211</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Brettl-Hupfers Ski &amp; Sports Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263428466000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekend at the Bretts, January 22 - 24th, 2010</name><id>12313432</id><headcount>53</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264212000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club/events/12313432/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/5/global_6726629.jpeg</photo_url></item>
