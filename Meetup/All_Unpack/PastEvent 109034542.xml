 Let's hike Temple Mountain, including a visit to the Temple Mountain Ledges (1,770 ft.) with its interesting cairns and directional views. We will continue from there along the ridge to two of the three summits of Temple Mountain, the wooded Holt Peak (2,055 ft.) and Burton Peak (2,010 ft.), which offers a west-facing outlook offering an outstanding view of Mt. Monadnock (above). For the most part, this is a wooded ridge walk, but there are a few outlooks along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are we getting there?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 We will follow the Wapack Trail south from the Temple Mountain State Reservation parking lot the entire way, out and back. The beginning part of the route passes through and around the former Temple Mountain ski area before reaching the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the distance and how long will it take us?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Round trip distance between the parking area and Burton Peak is approximately 5.6 miles, and should take us between 3-4 hours with breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will we need?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Proper attire and equipment for a winter hike. Microspikes are required, snowshoes may be needed, please bring them along if you have them. I hiked this route a few weeks ago and spikes were sufficient at that time, but with the snowfall since then, the less-traveled section between Holt and Burton Peaks may require snowshoes, even with the recent warm temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about parking?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 There is plentiful parking at the Temple Mountain State Reservation lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is the trailhead?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 The trail leaves the Temple Mountain State Reservation parking lot off NH Route 101, opposite the entrance to Miller State Park, Peterborough, NH. This will be an out and back hike, returning to the same trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is on St. Patrick's Day. Should we dress up?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 You get bonus points for leprechaun attire. : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything else?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Inclement weather will reschedule the hike, and I will post any relevant updates here. Here's the point forecast for this area if you want to keep track:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
