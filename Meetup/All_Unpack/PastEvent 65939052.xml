&lt;p&gt;(UK, 1993, 82mins.) Written and directed by Terence Davies. Cinematography by Michael Coulter. Cast: Leigh McCormack, Marjorie Yates, Anthony Watson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinestudio presents the fully restored 35mm film print of one of the most elusively beautiful movies to be made on celluloid: Terence Davies’ "The Long Day Closes." Through the lingering power of visual images, a grim childhood in 1950s Liverpool is transformed into the intense dream world of an eleven-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for self-discovery, he takes in every influence around him, from his working class Catholic family, to the sound of Debbie Reynolds singing “Tammy,” to the total liberation he finds only in the front row of the balcony of his local cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beautifully poetic, never contrived or precious, the film dazzles with its stylistic confidence, emo​tional honesty, terrific wit and all-round audacity.” – Geoff Andrew, Time Out (London)&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338500583000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337737855000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"THE LONG DAY CLOSES" @ Cinestudio</name><id>65939052</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1338419700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/65939052/</event_url></item>
