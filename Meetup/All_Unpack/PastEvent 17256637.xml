&lt;p&gt;The restaurant started in Cannes, France, and was reconstructed in loving detail here in Boston.&amp;nbsp; The menu features two kinds of foie gras and many delicious appetizers and entrees.&amp;nbsp; Check out their web site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"La Voile, "the sail" in French, is a small authentic French brasserie and an import from the South of France. Founded in 1947, and known as "La Voile au Vent" (The Sail in the Wind),  it was one of the oldest &amp;amp; most appreciated restaurants in Cannes. ... The idea to bring La Voile to Boston came about by an American named  Pierre, a sailor by choice &amp;amp; owner of a superbe sailing yacht moored  directly across from the restaurant. He soon became a regular customer  and a good friend. Over time &amp;amp; many glasses of wine, the plan to  open a restaurant in Boston together was hatched.... Everything was brought over... the zinc bar, the tables and chairs,  the wooden wine fridge (an old Butcher's fridge), the marble console,  the vintage chandeliers, sailing pictures, the knives, the entrance  door... even the staff! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The Cuisine is evidently French and authentic, with some "Meridional"  dishes like the "Soupe de Poisson" (Fish Soupe) or the Loup de Mer  (Seabass) imported fresh from the Mediterranean. These dishes will  surely conjure up memories of your last trip to the South of France or  inspire you to discover this wonderful region called the French Riviera."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reservation is for four but can be expanded.&amp;nbsp; Bring your appetite!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the hostess for the Meetup group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Harold</member_name><member_id>5109349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303347491000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>We love French!</why><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-625</urlname><id>824450</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Food Snobs Unite (FSU) - Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302480737000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>La Voile</name><id>17256637</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303255800000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-625/events/17256637/</event_url></item>
