THEN RSVP “yes” on Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;If you’d like to attend, but you don’t have a ticket yet, RSVP “maybe.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***IMPORTANT***&lt;br /&gt;You have to buy your own ticket.  The RSVP on Meetup lets me know to save a seat for you.  It does NOT get you a ticket for the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I posted this event on the website, I also sent an email to everyone in the group.  The email has details about how to get advance tickets, as well as more information about the movie.  If you'd like me to send it to you again, use the link above next to &amp;quot;Who's organizing?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the small French flag (about 4” x 6”)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>A</member_name><member_id>8074607</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255731829000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254599595000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tea on the Axis of Evil</name><id>11538552</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255136400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/11538552/</event_url></item>
