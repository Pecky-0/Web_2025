All hikers must have cold weather gear and be experienced above treeline in winter conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All attendees must read, understand and agree to the waiver/liability as outlined by this website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near Alton Bay&lt;br /&gt;Alton Bay, NH 03810&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Descend by walking away from the view (in a westerly direction) to get onto Brook Trail. &lt;br /&gt;• Follow Brook Trail, keeping to the right as you pass two trail junctions on the upper part of the mountain. &lt;br /&gt;• Brook Trail will flow straight into Mount Major Trail/Main Trail which will return you to the parking lot, 2.4 miles from the summit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place         Split&lt;br /&gt;Miles      Total&lt;br /&gt;Miles      Split&lt;br /&gt;Time      Total&lt;br /&gt;Time     &lt;br /&gt;Parking lot (650')  0.0  0.0  0:00  0:00 &lt;br /&gt;Mt.

There is a sign on route 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead is on the back right side of the parking lot if you are facing the mountain. There is a small trail on the left back side of the parking lot but this is not the trail for Mt Major. (Lat:43.50396 Lon:-71.29729)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be hiking up Mt. Major via the main trail.  This trail is 2.4 miles long one way and should take us approximately 1:30 to reach the summit.  Upon reaching the summit we can make a decision as a group on whether or not to take the Major/Straightback link over to Straightback mountain.  This would add approximately an additional 3 miles round trip to the hike.  Therefore total distance would be approximately 7.8 miles and should take approximately 6 hours to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Mt. Major offers some of the best views for a minimum smount of hiking.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a relatively low elevation mountain, expect to encounter cold weather conditions.  Dress appropriately!!  Snowshoes are generally not required, since this is a often used trail.  Foot traction devices are generally not required, but are strongly encouraged in case icey conditions are encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead: Parking lot is on the left hand side or Route 11 just 4.2 miles north of the town of Alton Bay. There is a sign on route 11.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>WE WILL BE IN A SILVER SUBARU LEGACY</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293972119000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289849396000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MT MAJOR &amp; STRAIGHTBACK</name><id>15454794</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293894000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/15454794/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/a/global_17612186.jpeg</photo_url></item>
