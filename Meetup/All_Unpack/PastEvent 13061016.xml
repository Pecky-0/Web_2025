'08! Red Stripe is billed as an American Brasserie (owned by the same people who own Mills Tavern - there is also a Red Stripe in Narragansett. Located in the Wayland Square area on the East Side, its a great place to pop into for a late lunch or early dinner or anytime for that matter, and has a large marble bar with fixed twirling bar stools in an appropriately French-American bistro atmosphere. Its been awhile - so let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a black and gray scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
