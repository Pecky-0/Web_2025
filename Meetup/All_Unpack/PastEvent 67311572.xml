&lt;p&gt;The latest forecast for Concord, MA is clearing for the next couple of hours or so, but with a chance of thundershowers from noon-3 pm onwards (the start time of the thundershowers varies from weather site to weather site). For the comfort and safety of all involved, the paddle is postponed till tomorrow, same place and time. Please update your RSVP if you will not be attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather Update and Rain Date:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Weatherspark (&lt;a href="http://weatherspark.com/#!dashboard;a=USA/MA/Concord" class="linkified"&gt;http://weatherspark.com/#!dashboard;a=USA/MA/Concord&lt;/a&gt;) there is a 40% chance of rain/thunderstorms for most of the day on Saturday. I will post a message on Saturday morning on whether or not the paddle will happen as scheduled by 8 am; rain date is Sunday, same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On summer weekends the two-mile stretch from South Bridge to Old North Bridge and beyond can, at times, feel like Storrow Drive before a Red Sox game! The meandering Sudbury and Concord Rivers offers excellent quiet water paddling, and is a popular venue for canoes and kayaks. We will explore the Assabet River, the river less paddled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Assabet River flows 31 miles from its headwaters in Westborough to Egg Rock in Concord, where it merges with the Sudbury River to form the Concord River. The river meanders past stately homes and through woodlands and pastures. There are a number of (very) small islands in the river that add to the character. Wildlife is abundant; on a recent paddle I saw deer, Muscovy ducks, mallards, blue herons and a red tail hawk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will put-in in Concord at 11:30 am and paddle upstream for about 3 miles. We’ll pull out boats ashore and enjoy a picnic lunch under the trees, and then paddle back to our starting point. It is an easy paddle that anyone who has paddled before will be able to handle with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that have their own boats can put-in at the Lowell Road ramp (200 Lowell Road, Concord MA), just outside Concord center, heading towards Carlisle (ramp is on the left, just before the bridge). Those that want to rent can do so from South Bridge Boathouse (www.canoeconcord.com) on Rt 62 (Main Street) in Concord. Each group will paddle to Egg Rock, where the Sudbury River and Assabet Rivers converge (within sight of the Lowell Road boat ramp, and downstream from the South Bridge Boathouse.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then paddle as a group up the Assabet River to West Concord where we will have lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can get a co-leader, we’ll split the group in two. The slower paddlers will take their time paddling to the lunch spot (about 2.5 miles from Egg Rock), while the stronger paddlers can paddle to the Damon Mill dam (about 3.5 miles from Egg Rock) before returning to join the rest of the group for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PFD's (aka lifevests) must be worn by all participants. Bring lunch and plenty of water to drink.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reserve a kayak or canoe at South Bridge Boathouse call 978-371-2465.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I plan on cross-posting this with one or two other MeetUp groups)&lt;/p&gt;
