Some kids get the pics before they eat, others afterwards. Depends on the crowd at their time of arrival. This is a great event for us and McDonalds. Set up at 7:30. Make sure signage is up and cameras and printers are ready to go and bunny is in place at 8a. Lots of kids and lots of pictures is the goal!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It'll be hard to miss.
