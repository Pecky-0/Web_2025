A true sister or brother overlooks the faults of others and sees everyone with the eyes of God.  God knows and sees only the true nature of created beings - the divinity within each one.  This powerful love and compassion brings a healing and wholeness that ripples through the human family and raises up the Earth into Light and Love.  Join us for this seminar and discussion of how the highest of human ideals - universal Peace, Love and Joy - can become realities on this Earth.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206056154000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Father Peter Bowes is a Master Teacher and a true inspiration.
