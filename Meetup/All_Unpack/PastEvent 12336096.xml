Their menu not only includes pizza but sandwiches, pasta, and salad as well. If you have not attended a Meetup at Damata's before, generally everyone orders at 6:30, and we socialize and eat until starting games shortly after 7:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(We do request at Meetups held at service venues that each person attending at least order one item: food or beverage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also plenty of free parking. Should you be coming from outside of Salem, just remember that Damata's is on Bridge St., not the Bridge St. Bypass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your favorite board game to play.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264203253000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263659523000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game night at Damata's</name><id>12336096</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264030200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/12336096/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/7/d/global_5891501.jpeg</photo_url></item>
