It is slower paced then hip hop but works the body to the max. We'll start with a warm up that includes some belly dance, latin dance, and hip hop, then really break a sweat learning a fun and flirty chair routine. You will love this fun and empowering class that helps tone your legs, abs, and butt! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, May 12th at 8pm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridgets Dance Studio &lt;br /&gt;89 Pearl St #5A &lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184 &lt;br /&gt;(Pull into Frazier Parkway, across from Campenelli's, and the third garage door on the left.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost $10 per person (cash please) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will work up a sweat, so remember the water! And you want to be comfortable, yoga pants and a tank top work great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember this is called STRIP FIT. You learn a chair routine. If you consider yourself a conservative person this might not be for you. I think it is a blast and spent the whole time laughing! :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>4336960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273799684000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272506127000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Strip Fit</name><id>13325443</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273708800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/13325443/</event_url></item>
