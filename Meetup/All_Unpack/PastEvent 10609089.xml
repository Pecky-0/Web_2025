<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have put together a fantastic Scenic Ireland trip! Four nights and five days in Dublin ...including airfare from NYC to Dublin, 4 nights lodging at a four star hotel. This package also includes a full Irish breakfast each day. All this for $517.92, dbl occ. (all taxes and departure fees included). What a bargain!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can arrange for sightseeing at an additional fee. All interested parties should respond ASAP to Terri ...203-808-5829. Or send me an email ...terri0417@yahoo.com. A $150.00 deposit is required at the time of your booking.Full Payment will be due in about a month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sightseeing, once a group has been established, we will meet and decide what sightseeing tours we would like to add. I will also keep this group to a maximum of 20  people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...this is indeed a bargain! But you must act soon to get this price!!! It is sure to sell out quickly. I look forward to hearing from interested parties...&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258502165000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244514759000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scenic Dublin, Ireland Trip...4 nts/5 days </name><id>10609089</id><headcount>33</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258059600000</time><rsvp_limit>32</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/10609089/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/8/global_9060712.jpeg</photo_url></item>
