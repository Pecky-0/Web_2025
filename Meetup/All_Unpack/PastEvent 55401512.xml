So come join us for a relaxing and fun afternoon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some parking in front of the cafe. Additional parking across the street. Avoid the spaces that show a diamond design in it. Interestingly enough, the spots showing "reserved" are OK to park in (according to the cafe owners).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us inside</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandra Cipriani</member_name><member_id>10013774</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334498503000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Knitters and stitchers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1389430</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6500015259</group_lon><name>Knitting &amp; Needlework in the Boroughs</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331153598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Knit, Crochet, Needlework surrounded by art</name><id>55401512</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334426400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Northborough-Knitting-Needlework-Meetup-Group/events/55401512/</event_url></item>
