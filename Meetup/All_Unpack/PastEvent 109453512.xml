How does a relationship develop? When we address our own mind and are aware of ourselves, our relationships flourish. If we are unaware, we make the same mistakes in every relationship- if we cannot row one boat, we cannot row any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and learn about the mind, its tendencies, and qualities that help relationships flourish. And come and learn what meditation has to do with all of this-- it is more relevant than you may think to being an open and loving person.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Richa Bhatnagar</member_name><member_id>12435992</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364417176000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonmeditates</urlname><id>1257412</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>"Boston Meditates" Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363381249000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Secrets of Relationships: Mind and Meditation</name><id>109453512</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364252400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonmeditates/events/109453512/</event_url></item>
