(If this starts to run long, we can always go into more depth next month.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The restaurant closes at 8 PM, so it's a good idea to get there by 7 PM if you want to get some food without having to tear yourself away from the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Shearer</member_name><member_id>1529786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1170979890000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>PHP Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>php-338</urlname><id>282097</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Providence PHP Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1167786302000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence PHP Meetup February Meetup</name><id>5360187</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170806400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/php-338/events/5360187/</event_url></item>
