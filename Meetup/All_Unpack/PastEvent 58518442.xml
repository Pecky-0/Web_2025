As I am writing this I am in Florida for a celebration of life for a close friend who passed from breast cancer. This amazing woman was told she had months to live and remarkably lived for 6 happy years with no chemo or radiation....only good organic foods and supplementation. &amp;nbsp;The only reason that she died is because she ran out of money and as you know insurance is only willing to pay for drugs. &amp;nbsp;The reason I run the meetup is to hopefully help people realize that our food is killing us and most of all there are things we can do to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fri April 6 Potluck! &amp;nbsp;Bring an organic raw vegan dish enough for 6-8 people. &amp;nbsp;If you are new and not sure what to bring a salad (fruit or veggie) is always great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;MOVIE NIGHT!! &amp;nbsp;"Average Joe on Raw" &amp;nbsp;A great new fun and informative movie which really shows how if you are eating a Standard American Diet your body gets depleted of necessary nutrients at a very young age. &amp;nbsp;We are walking around in our 20's thinking we can conquer the world not realizing how devastating our SAD is to our health. &amp;nbsp;This is a must see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note meetup is starting at 6. &amp;nbsp;Movie no later than 7:15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a terrific week! &amp;nbsp;Can't wait to see everyone!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
