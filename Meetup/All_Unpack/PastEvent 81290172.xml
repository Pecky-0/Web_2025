On the suggestion of Stacey, I'm adding it as a meetup. The movie starts at 7, so let's meet outside the theater at 6:45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot: as a boy, Mark Wahlberg wishes his teddy bear were alive. He gets his wish and he and Ted become best friends. Then Mark Wahlberg grows up and Ted still hangs around, drinking and drugging and generally being the obnoxious friend that you'd be better off without but you can't get rid of because you still love the guy. But his girlfriend, Mila Kunis wants Ted gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet outside the theater</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347157117000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347019670000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ted</name><id>81290172</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347057900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/81290172/</event_url></item>
