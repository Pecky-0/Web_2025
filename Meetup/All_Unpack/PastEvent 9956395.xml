Thankfully, nearby there's Boston's  Esplanade/loop around the Charles River and its paved bikeways for riders of every ability level. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stretch of riverside space between Mass Ave. and Longfellow bridges is flush with sailboats, lots of sunbathers, joggers, cyclists and in-line skaters. The Esplanade is home to the Hatch Shell, Boston's famous outdoor music amphitheater, two playgrounds and landscaped hills, lakes and bridges. It's also home to Community Boating, and sailing club. During the Spring this is where you'll find hundreds of Cherry blossoms in bloom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is something that interests people just RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; thanks...!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242145122000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237087329000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Boston's Esplanade - Boston's own small answer to the French Riviera.</name><id>9956395</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241971200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9956395/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/4/c/global_7672684.jpeg</photo_url></item>
