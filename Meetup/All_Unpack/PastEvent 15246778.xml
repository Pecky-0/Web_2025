We will wrap up the two-day cooking event with a potluck feast starting at 4:00PM. Please join us for any portion of the event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oven will be stoked up again Sunday morning and will be hot enough for pizza at noon followed by pies, veggies, breads and more until the feast at 4:pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact Erin Stack erinstack@comcast.net or 978-807-6315 to reserve a baking time so she can make sure everyone&amp;#8217;s food has a space in the oven at the right temperature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your time is short, you may drop off food for the feast and the oven tenders will cook it for you! Salads and other non-baked dishes would be welcome additions to the potluck menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a suggested $5 donation to offset the cost of the oven and support the groups environmental mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This promises to be a fun, educational and tasty experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presented as a collaboration between New Eden Community Gardens, First Parish Church, Transition Newburyport and North Shore Permaculture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the parking lot behind the church and you will see the oven crowd</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289872768000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288192574000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cob Oven Community Cooking Day Two</name><id>15246778</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289754000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/15246778/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/7/global_7064327.jpeg</photo_url></item>
