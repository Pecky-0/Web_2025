<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to try to get some regular climbing organized. Weekly bi weekly etc.I live very close to Den rock in Lawrence, MA and have everything for top roping. Tuesdays, and Fridays afternoons, Mondays and Thursdays after work 430-5PM and most weekends work well for me. &lt;br /&gt;

I am fairly flexible with time and location. I really just love to climb and I have been to busy this year to do much climbing&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368216802000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344084429000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly bi weekly climbing at Den Rock or fairly close</name><id>76298292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368205200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/76298292/</event_url></item>
