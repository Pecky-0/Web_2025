Do not fret, old FAN Alliance has a solution.  Its called a Chocolate Potluck.  We will have a meet and greet, lots of chocolate and games, some party games, some stategy games. There should be a little something for everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this does not describe you and you are planning to celebrate on the real Valentines Day, come on over anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dessert potluck, so bring over your favorite dessert with some chocolate in it. I will email directions to those who RSVP YES.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266365832000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Gamers</urlname><id>393834</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Greater Nashua Gamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263681422000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Annual Valentines Chocolate Potluck: Meet, Greet &amp; Games</name><id>12339010</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266102000000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Gamers/events/12339010/</event_url></item>
