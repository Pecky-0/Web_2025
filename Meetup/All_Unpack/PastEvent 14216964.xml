The August selection is &amp;quot;The Girl Who Played With Fire&amp;quot; by Steig Larrson.  We'll be meeting on August 29th at Bruegger's at 4:00pm.  Several people asked if you needed to read the first book in the trilogy before tackling the second and most of us agreed that you do.  However, having seen the movie, it's so faithful to the book, that seeing the movie would probably give you enough of a foundation to read the second book without reading the first.  No matter what way you tackle it, hope you'll join us.&lt;br /&gt;The September book is &amp;quot;The Art of Racing in the Rain&amp;quot;.
