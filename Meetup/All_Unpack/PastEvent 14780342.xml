Siro's is absolutely a stunning interior adds to the dinner. Plus you have the extra benefit of an excellent view of the waterfront.   You voted for this at the #1 Warm Weather Restaurant you would like to dine at so please join us for what could be our last Warm Weather Restaurant of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entrees range from $15.00 -$30.00.  Appetizers range from $6-$17 (There is a Pasta Course, Main Course, Grilled Pizzas and Light Courses).  You can see the Meal Courses on their website.  If you have a chance look at the entrees that they provide.  I think you need to leave room for dessert.&lt;br /&gt;I realize some of the entrees are a little high but you can look the different courses they provide a range you may like.  &lt;br /&gt;Siro's has different price levels to make your evening very enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you all will join be for some fun, laughter and maybe a glass of wine.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday Dinner at Siro's at Marina Bay &lt;br /&gt;Thursday  September 30th @ 6:30 PM &lt;br /&gt;307 Victory Road&lt;br /&gt;North Quincy, MA 02171&lt;br /&gt;617-472-4500&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sirosrestaurant.com" target="_blank"&gt;Siros Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Location: Inside the lobby. We will then be seated as a Group.

Max of 10 people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: 1 per Member &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fees: Annual Members - FREE, Group Members - $2, Guests - $2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: 7pm on Wednesday, September 29 a No-Show per our guidelines on the About Us page. Please Note: The restaurant has requested we call in our final RSVP on Saturday. (A quick note about the RSVP Deadline, you can only RSVP up until 10am the day of the event. After that time you will not be able to RSVP. While the Group's RSVP Deadline is Saturday evening, this will allow anyone to join us Sunday morning if a spot opens up if someone is unable to make it between Saturday's deadline and Sunday's cutoff. You can't RSVP on the site after 10am on Sunday. Our No-Show policy remains the same; any changes from Yes to No after the deadline and/or anyone who is a Yes at the deadline who does not attend is considered a No-Show. Our updated RSVP policy still allows for one excused No-Show per 12 month period from the previous excused N/S.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cash Only Policy: Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over three years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the wait staff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Event takes place rain or shine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  &lt;br /&gt;You can get the directions directly from Siro's website, but feel free to use your GPS or Google maps if you prefer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture and will wait in the entry way / lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeanne</member_name><member_id>714439</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285947173000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>South Shore Diners</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssdomg</urlname><id>313308</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284569508000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Siro's at Marina Bay </name><id>14780342</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285885800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/events/14780342/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/6/global_16657014.jpeg</photo_url></item>
