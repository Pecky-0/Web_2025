There is a snack bar there if you get the munchies or want some hot chocolate to warm up.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to dress in layers, since you may tend to get warm after skating for a while. Gloves, hats or ear muffs are recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup may be cancelled in the event of a snow storm or there is not at least a minimum of 4 YES RSVP's including organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They DO have rentals available. More details to follow soon on admission and rental cost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday Public Skating Hours   2:00pm-3:50pm  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alison &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My picture is posted.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267555759000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265512798000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ice Skating Anyone (Revisited) </name><id>12540491</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267382700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/12540491/</event_url></item>
