<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>(Correction:  This is SATURDAY, not Sunday) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting will be VERY different from our other meetups.  We will be focusing on analyzing deals and how to navigate through your financial worksheet faster and more efficiently.  The first hour will be drills designed to teach how to analyze deals faster.  Then we will play the game, but only for an hour, to see how far we can really get.  REMEMBER:  Kiyosaki says that we should be getting out of the Rat Race in an hour consistently, and that is what we'll be shooting for.  The whole point of this meeting is to analyze deals more quickly, so we will hit that pretty hard during the game.  The last hour will be a recap of what we did during the game.  It will almost be like a replay of the game whereby we reanalyze the deals we took and, in retrospect, look again to see if those deals really were ones we should have taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Room 150</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243181361000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241528456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cashflow Lightning Round--SATURDAY May 9, 2009</name><id>10342002</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241895600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/10342002/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
