In recent decades however, the lines that separate the lifestyles of even very young children from adults are blurring. Children begin formal education now in preschool, dress like adults, listen to the same music, play the same video games, explore the same Internet sites, and watch explicit depictions of sex and violence on TV and in movies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the impact of immersing children in a sexualized world? Learn about the ways in which children are being sexualized, and the physical and psychological consequences that affect thier health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Imani</member_name><member_id>7960334</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265684220000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264724838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Raising Healthy, Sensual Children</name><id>12454274</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265155200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/12454274/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/a/global_12837178.jpeg</photo_url></item>
