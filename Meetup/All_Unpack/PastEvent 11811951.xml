All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat. Although this is a fairly intense workout you can modify exercises to make easier for first timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Barnes (Wedeln Race team coach) will lead the group in Plyometric based training methods designed to get the leg muscles and core ready for the season. This is the same workout that he has used for many years to prepare for ski racing. There is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape. Most weeks we hit a local bar for beer and food after the workout.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will be near the center of the common, if it rains we will be in the gazebo.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259278637000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257524365000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ski Fitness Training</name><id>11811951</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259105400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak/events/11811951/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/f/global_10406431.jpeg</photo_url></item>
