<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a quick hike to Webster first (on the 52WAV list), followed by Jackson (on the NH48 list).  We will be taking the Webster-Jackson trail, first summiting Webster, followed by Jackson and then return to the car.  Approx. 6.5miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary Report from 'summitpost.org':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webster Jackson Trail&lt;/strong&gt; starts at Route 302 at the northwest end of the Crawford Notch State Park. The parking lot, which is about .25 miles from the Highland Center at Crawford Notch, is across the highway from the trailhead. The trail, blazed in blue, climbs 1.4 miles to the trail junction, where the choice is left towards Mt. Jackson or right towards Mt. Webster. The two peaks are joined by the Webster Cliff Trail, affording an easy loop over two peaks. The total distance for the loop is 6.5 miles, with 2500 feet of climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to complete this hike in under 4.5hours.  This is &lt;strong&gt;a moderate to fast-paced trip with NO breaks scheduled&lt;/strong&gt; (other than stopping for delayering, drinking, a quick bite to eat,... but no picnicking on summits etc.). &lt;strong&gt;Due to the pace and elevation gain, this trip is considered intermediate.&lt;/strong&gt; Please do not sign up for this hike if you do not intend to hike without a break and have not completed other hikes without breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The host reserves the right to screen people and alter the attendee list due to the above set pace and time goals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please arrive early to get your gear ready so that you are ready to leave the parking lot at 10am (and not pull into the lot at 10am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;slowest hiker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guests are not permitted.&lt;/strong&gt; All participants must be members of the Random Group of Hikers. This allows us to keep track of and communicate with each person who signs up to participate in our events.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dogs are not permitted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I did all of my research for this trip using the Appalachian Mountain Club's "White Mountain Guide", a trail map, and the Internet. You should become self-reliant by becoming familiar with the route, terrain, and potential hazards since you are ultimately responsible for your own safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We could alter our plans because of fatigue, weather, and/or other conditions and there is no guarantee that we will complete the entire event as described here (e.g. we might not reach the summit).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;=====&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. The higher we climb the colder, windier, and wetter it will be - we will need to be prepared. Remember, on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;average it gets 3-4 degrees (Fahrenheit) colder for every 1,000 feet of elevation gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing, Gear, Equipment, and Supplies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list describing the minimum required items to participate in this event. Hiking safely is about being prepared so that you can respond to an emergency situation or spend a night in the woods if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or out on the trail. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footwear&lt;/strong&gt;: hiking boots with synthetic or wool socks. Gaiters to keep the debris out of your boots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing&lt;/strong&gt;: Dress in synthetics, fleece, and/or wool layers to easily regulate body temperature. Make sure your layers fit comfortably over each other. DO NOT WEAR COTTON - while cotton is a great insulator when it is dry, once wet it doesn't dry easily and conducts heat away from the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outerwear&lt;/strong&gt;: Insulated jacket (e.g. fleece). Windproof/waterproof shell (with hood) and pants (e.g. gore-tex). Make sure your outerwear fits comfortably over all of your other clothing. Fleece/wool hat, neck warmer, and glove liners. Windproof/waterproof over-mittens (e.g. gore-tex).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and Water&lt;/strong&gt;: Bring high-energy snacks, food for lunch - pack extra "just in case". Bring enough water to stay properly hydrated during the trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelter&lt;/strong&gt;: You should always be prepared to spend a night in the woods if you have to. Options include an ultralight tarp, a bivy sack, or an emergency space blanket (which packs small and weighs just ounces).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Essential Gear&lt;/strong&gt;: Map and compass - don't just bring them know how to use them. Plastic whistle. Headlamp with two sets of spare batteries (lithium work best in colder temperatures). Personal first aid kit with an emergency space blanket (e.g. mylar). Small pocket knife or multi-purpose tool. Matches or wind-proof lighter and fire starter. Sunscreen is important since we will be traveling on exposed trails. Lip balm. Sunglasses. Waterproof cover for your pack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Items&lt;/strong&gt;: Trekking poles. Bug spray. Camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
