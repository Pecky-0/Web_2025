I originally wanted to go to this place - Teriyaki House - on Westminster but couldn't remember the name until I walked by last night. Then I realized I scheduled us for Sura across the street. Similar themed food, but TH has a bit more room for large parties. Sura is much smaller and if the majority would prefer we can switch back to this place but I don't know if they can fit a group our size. So I will find out if the majority prefer Sura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we are on for Teriyaki (&amp;amp; Korean) House across the street. Get Japanese or Korean. I've eaten here once and had the bimbimbap and it was yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure to bring cash as we will not be splitting the check evenly. This is limited to the amount of people that is conducive to good conversation at a dining table. If more people join the waitlist, we could potentially get more than one table. Please make sure to keep your rsvp up to date as we'll make a reservation and that way waiting list people can join in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us will be heading over to Local 121 for Handsome Pete's monthly session of 80s music. If you can't make dinner, meet us there for drinks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333812125000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331250470000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner @ Teriyaki House downtown</name><id>55573192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333755000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/55573192/</event_url></item>
