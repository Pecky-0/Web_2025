<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This hike will be approximately 3.5 miles and should last around 2 hours. The trail is relativity flat with some board walks over the marsh.  I would consider this an easy hike. RAIN CANCELS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a day pack, water, insect repellent, sunscreen, and waterproof boots. I will make every effort to get us back to our cars before sunset but please bring a small flashlight for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a hiking group. That means we start together and we finish together and are only as fast as our slowest hiker.  Please keep this in mind if you decide to join us.  Also, keep an open mind to hikes having to be shortened on-the-fly if the group is moving slower than expected. I do not want us to get caught in the dark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Dogs or Children: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to email me or contact me through here if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=106880071684886446021.0004883c7ac9749c2323d&amp;amp;ll=41.776241,-72.563624&amp;amp;spn=0.01397,0.033023&amp;amp;z=16" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
