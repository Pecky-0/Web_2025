Then a bridge crosses a small brook at a sharp left turn in the trail, and the Hi-Cannon Trail leaves right. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Hi-Cannon Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.90 mi/52 min/+834 ft on the Lonesome Lake Trail &lt;br /&gt; From this point, the trail ascends by three long switchbacks, then descends slightly to a junction near the shore of Lonesome Lake, where the old bridle path ends; here the Cascade Brook Trail enters left and the Dodge Cutoff diverges right. &lt;br /&gt; to Lonesome Lake &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 1.20 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 1 hr 7 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +1030 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -26 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +1004 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 0.20 mi/6 min/-9 ft on the Lonesome Lake Trail &lt;br /&gt; A few steps ahead, there is a fine view of North and South Kinsman rising from the far side of the lake. For the shortest route to Lonesome Lake Hut follow the Cascade Brook and Fishinâ€™ Jimmy trails. The Lonesome Lake Trail becomes a footpath that continues along the north shore, coinciding with the Around-Lonesome-Lake Trail, which diverges left and leads to Lonesome Lake Hut. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Around-Lonesome-Lake Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.90 mi/48 min/+675 ft on the Lonesome Lake Trail &lt;br /&gt; The Lonesome Lake Trail continues northwest, soon begins to rise more steeply, and ends at the Kinsman Ridge Trail in Coppermine Col, southwest of the summit of Cannon Mountain. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Kinsman Ridge Trail &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 2.30 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 2 hr 1 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +1723 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -52 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +1670 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 0.40 mi/27 min/+490 ft on the Kinsman Ridge Trail &lt;br /&gt; In a few yards, the trail reaches the low point in Coppermine Col, at the base of Cannon Mountain, then climbs a very steep and rough slope among huge boulders. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Hi-Cannon Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.40 mi/16 min/+127 ft on the Kinsman Ridge Trail &lt;br /&gt; The Hi-Cannon Trail enters right, and the Kinsman Ridge Trail swings left and climbs gradually to the gravel Rim Trail, where it encounters the maze of trails in the summit area. The true summit, with its observation platform and lookout tower, is reached in 120 yd. by following the gravel path straight ahead from this junction; a path continues from the tower down to the Cannon Mountain Tramway summit station. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Rim Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.04 mi/1 min/+41 ft on the Rim Trail &lt;br /&gt; The Rim Trail diverges from the Kinsman Ridge Trail and ascends gradually to the summit observation tower. &lt;br /&gt; to Cannon Mtn &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.13 mi/7 min/-88 ft on the Rim Trail &lt;br /&gt; The trail descends from the summit observation tower to the Tramway terminal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 3.27 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 2 hr 52 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2409 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -168 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +2241 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 0.05 mi/2 min/+6 ft on the Rim Trail &lt;br /&gt; The trail leaves the Tramway terminal and shorly reaches its northern junction with the Kinsman Ridge Trail. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Kinsman Ridge Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 2.02 mi/1 hr 3 min/-2027 ft on the Kinsman Ridge Trail &lt;br /&gt; The main trail descends steadily, and it turns right onto a ski trail and descends along its right edge. Soon the trail descends steeply through a semi-open area of ski glades, with rough and rocky footing including some slippery ledges. The hiking trail crosses the ski route four times, with occasional views north; follow markings carefully. It continues steeply down into the woods as the ski trail descends to the left. The descent remains steep down through eroded gravelly sections with slippery footing. Finally, it emerges in a field at the base of a steep slope and follows a service road left for 150 yd. to its end at the Cannon Mountain Tramway parking lot. &lt;br /&gt; to Kinsman Ridge Trailhead (north) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 5.34 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 3 hr 57 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2502 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -2281 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +221 ft &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268665721000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268060614000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cannon Mountain via Lonesome Lake Hut</name><id>12816221</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268492400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12816221/</event_url></item>
