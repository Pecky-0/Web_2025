Dogs can be off leash (as long as they are under owner control and non-aggressive), and the scenery is great for viewing, pictures, enjoying the nice weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your friends and your friendly dog to enjoy this fantastic trail...  If you've never done it, you'll love it forever; if you have, you know what I mean :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget shoes (that don't matter too much... as long as they can get messy!) and poop bags, as this park is carry-in, carry-out (we HAVE to be responsible :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really look forward to seeing as many as possible of you there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email justcassie101@comcast.net with questions, concerns, comments or suggestions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punish the Deed, Not the Breed.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>NEBBC Attire, and ALL THE BULLY BREEDS! :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271088748000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269440981000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Off- or On-Leash Meet-Up at the Ashland Resevoir!</name><id>dlwgnyngbnb</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270915200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/12978221/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/a/7/global_7822007.jpeg</photo_url></item>
