<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Eileen and I are going to try to include the covered bridge trip into this one.  I will be working with her to compile a list of sites for us to explore.  This is a great opportunity to capture some great fall foliage and to get together with some other members.  If there are any other AO that would like to assist please let Eileen or myself know.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kancamagus Scenic Byway follows a beautiful path through New Hampshire's White Mountains. Visitors know it as one of the world's most spectacular fall-foliage trips, but a stunning spectrum of color underscores the region's natural beauty year round. The road meanders through vast forests, old logging roads, and Indian hunting paths. An abundance of history and recreation lies here, so take the time to pull off the road and explore all that the byway offers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be the people walking around taking pictures.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224008787000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221527649000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Autumn on the Kancamagus Highway</name><id>8765145</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223730000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/8765145/</event_url></item>
