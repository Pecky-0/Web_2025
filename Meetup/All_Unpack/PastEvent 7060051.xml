<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This Friday, we'll meet at 21 Lemon St. (the pumpkin-colored house) at 7:30 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any favorite games, feel free to bring them. We can play large group games, or we can split up into two different rooms to mix up the game playing.   For those who might be joining us for the first time, don't worry, I promise you'll enjoy yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is parking available on Lemon St. and more parking available on Northey St. (one block closer to the T) and on Cross St. (which tees into Lemon). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Also, just a note again, the house is home to two cats for those who are allergic. For those who aren't allergic but don't like cats, they will be put away for the evening. I apologize for those with allergies, we just need more volunteers to host in their cat-free homes.***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202138833000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199765137000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night at Liv and David's</name><id>7060051</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201307400000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7060051/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/f/global_1947167.jpeg</photo_url></item>
