Each guest gets a list of questions and you must find the answers to them from other people at the party. This is a fun way to meet lots of new people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also be checking out Splash- one of Boston's newest venues. Party also features complimentary pool, appetizers, and a fabulous roof deck. All guests get over $150 in giveaways and a few will get a prize worth $1,000!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't been to an event in a while or your new to the group, this is the perfect event to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket is a $10 donation at the door to Project Smile, the non profit organization dedicated to helping children who are involved in traumatic events. All of the proceeds from the event will go directly to Project Smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble finding us, please call Catherine at 774 232 0000.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo) near ticket purchasing area.
