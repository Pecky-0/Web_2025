I was there Tuesday and the conditions were good, and should hold up fine until then with the cold weather we are having.  We usually have 15 or so people, enough to break into groups based on ability.  How about some snow shoe folks also join us?  They rent skis, snow shoes, etc.  They also rent skating skis for anyone who is interested in trying that out.  Remember to bring cash, no credit cards accepted!  Bring a picnic lunch, they have hot chocolate.   &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy in the Santa hat....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263222587000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262723743000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Brook Saturday Morning</name><id>12231669</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263049200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/12231669/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
