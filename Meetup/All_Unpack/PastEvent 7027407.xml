Four Sunday Matinees showcase a sampling of new and award-winning German films rarely shown outside Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All films in German with English subtitles and shown in Moviehouse 2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket Price: All $5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Other Boy (Der Andere Junge)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two perfectly normal families live in a suburb of Hamburg. The fathers have been friends for years and work for the same company. However, the parents are unaware of the brutal and despairing animosity raging between their adolescent sons. Paul, the bully, goads his victim, the introverted Robert, to fatal violence: he shoots his tormentor. The parents cover up the crime and this family thriller takes an even more desperate and drastic turn to tragedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dir.
