This ritual is profound, educational and great deal of fun.  In a puja you will stand in a circle with other people and practice many different meditations with those in the group.  Through these exercises you will gain a deep understanding of Tantric principles and practices in a safe atmosphere to assist you in going deeper in your private relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;Charles Muir will be speaking about Tantra Yoga, an ancient spiritual system in which sexual love is considered a sacrament and the body a temple of the spirit.  Of the hundreds of Yogic paths, it is the only one that gives an alternative to celibacy.  It is a path for householders, where the two partners become One in an extended meditation wherein the entire body becomes an instrument of Love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;The goal of tantric practice is not  better sex, it is about Union.  It increases intimacy and connection, honoring the divine goddess in every woman, awakening and releasing female and male sexual energy  to move up through you, not out of you.  It is about aligning and awakening all of the chakras.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charles Muir&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;Charles Muir is considered the &amp;quot;Pioneer of the modern Tantra Movement in the United States.&amp;quot; He originated the &amp;quot;Tantra: the Art of Conscious Loving&amp;quot; format in 1980 &amp;amp; originated &amp;quot;Sacred spot massage&amp;quot; during that time. Sacred spot massage and many of his other experiential exercises have become cornerstones in most Tantra teacherâ€™s curriculum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charles has authored 2 Tantra books, 2 Tantra Training DVD's, 3 white Tantra CD's &amp;amp; 5 red Tantra CD's.  His work has been featured in over fifty media articles, television appearances, and 2 feature Hollywood movies: &amp;quot;Bliss&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Best Ever&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORE INFORMATION:&lt;br /&gt;Kerry Churchill&lt;br /&gt;santacruz@sourcetantra.com&lt;br /&gt;831.566.2113&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourcetantra.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.sourcetantra.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;center&gt;*** PRINT THIS EMAIL AND WE WILL WAIVE THE $25 ENTRANCE FEE!! ***&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leah Alchin, ACTE</member_name><member_id>7260814</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>YogiJamie</member_name><member_id>8132480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232248607000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Tantric Practitioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tantrausa</urlname><id>1157501</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Tantra USA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225566795000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tantra Puja and Lecture with Master, Charles Muir</name><id>9072867</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-28800000</utc_offset><time>1226806200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tantrausa/events/9072867/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/c/1/global_4199313.jpeg</photo_url></item>
