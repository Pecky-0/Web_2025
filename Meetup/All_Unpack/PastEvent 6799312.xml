You can check out their menu at &lt;a href="http://www.joesamerican.com/8.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.joesameric...&lt;/a&gt; .  We will be dining at their Back Bay location at 279 Dartmouth Street in Boston.  To get into the Christmas spirit, we are also having an optional Yankee Swap.  Please bring a $10 - $15 wrapped gift if you plan to participate.  Although optional, we encourage anyone who RSVPs to participate because it's just more fun.  For questions on brunch, contact Shirley.  For questions on the Yankee Swap, contact Anne.   Please be 99.99% certain that you will be able to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those not familiar with Yankee Swap, the rules are as follows: &lt;br /&gt; 1. Each person brings a wrapped gift which they add to the gift pile (please limit the value of the gift to $10 - $15)&lt;br /&gt; 2. Everyone draws a number to determine the order in which they get to pick a gift.&lt;br /&gt;    3. The person who drew #1 goes first and must open a gift from the pile.&lt;br /&gt;    4. The person who drew #2 goes next and has the choice of keeping the gift that they open or exchanging it with the gift opened by #1.&lt;br /&gt;    5. The person who is #3 goes next and has the choice of keeping a new opened gift or exchanging with any of the prior participants.&lt;br /&gt; 6. Play continues as such with players either keeping a gift or taking/swapping with any previously opened ones.&lt;br /&gt; 7. When a gift is opened the round is over (you can't decide you don't like what you opened and decide to swap for something else).&lt;br /&gt; 8. Once the round for the highest number player has completed player #1 can swap gifts with any other player (there is no futher swapping after that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following MEMBER GUIDELINES were developed so our events run smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our focus is on friendly and respectful gatherings while sharing a delicious meal.&lt;br /&gt;Your means of communication are this web page and email.
