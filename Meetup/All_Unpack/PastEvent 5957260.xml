<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Continuing the April Meetup theme of carrying things by bike, can you carry on your bike a dish to share at our summer picnic? This will be the official August Meetup, so that you can RSVP with what you would like to bring. We've built up enough equity from your monthly donations that I will be able to purchase the &amp;quot;meat&amp;quot; course (including veggie burgers along with the traditional hot dogs and hamburgers), so you can choose a salad, drink, or other side dish to bring. I don't know if Payson Park has grills or if some of us would have to bring ours, but I'll update the event text on the site when I find out.&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Let's meet at Noon, eat at 1, and sometime after the meal, probably between 2 and 2:30, all go for a nice relaxing recreational ride around the Back Bay trail! Check back here closer to the event for the exact meeting place in the park.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186502918000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183233055000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summer Picnic and Ride</name><id>5957260</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186329600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/5957260/</event_url></item>
