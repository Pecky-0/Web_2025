What is that? Well, what do you want it to be? We want to gather many Meetups in one place and invite the public to visit and check out what we do. Hopefully it drives membership and is fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to hear what you think about the idea and how we should present the Java Meetup. Do you want to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetings are personal, engaging and everybody is sharing in the topic at hand. Come and share your experience with us. Spring is here, making it easier to come to the venue and enjoy the company of Java enthusiasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaj&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Thank you to the many members that RSVP (one way or another). This helps me to manage the crowd at the venue.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaj Kandler</member_name><member_id>1142521</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172102838000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Java Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-java</urlname><id>87071</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Java Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168909272000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Java February Meetup</name><id>5396975</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171929600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-java/events/5396975/</event_url></item>
