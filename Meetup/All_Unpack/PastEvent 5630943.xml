<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Back by popular demand. In November we had a presentation that folks have asked me over and over again to repeat. This will not be repetitious. Ron Bouchard is the foremost expert on foreclosures. I have known him for less than a year.During this time i have become quite knowledgeable in the vast area of information involved. I have learned more from him, than from all the books, cds, videos, seminars and conversations with other people doing this work. This meeting will fill up fast. Once I post this to craigslist, there may be no more room. If you want to get the most out of the club, come early and network. dale&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dale</member_name><member_id>3116571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178751704000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>44</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175559063000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club May Meetup</name><id>5630943</id><headcount>32</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178578800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/5630943/</event_url></item>
