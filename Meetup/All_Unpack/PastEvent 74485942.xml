<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm starting a series of game nights at my place on the 2nd and 4th Monday of each month. They'll all start at 7:00. BYOB, BYOS(nacks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to, bring $1 to contribute towards our Meetup fees.  It's much appreciated, but absolutely not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll play a variety of games, but they'll mostly be Euros or strategy games rather than party games, mainly due to space issues.  (But also because I have an unmet craving for these types of games!)  Suggestions will certainly be accepted for future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attendee limit at each of these events will be determined by the maximum number of players the game can accommodate, so it will vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests aren't allowed at these events for three reasons:  1)  A very limited number of spots are available due to the nature of the games we'll be playing.  2)  It's easy enough for someone to join our group if they want to come.  If you have a "guest" you wish you could bring, just have them join the group and sign up.  3)  If you sign up with a guest and then bail at the last minute, chances are your guest won't come either, so we're down two players from what we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a waiting list available.  Please, if you sign up, be considerate of others and change your RSVP as soon as possible if you find you can't come.  No shows will be publicly derided.  If you're on the waiting list and get moved up on the day of the event, I'll try to contact you to make sure you're aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to seeing (and competing with!) you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;This time: &lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tower of Babel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/0/event_141782032.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great game that got a lot of play in our group a couple of years ago but has been in hiding lately.  Players cooperate to complete the 7 wonders of the world...  but try to do so in a way that benefits them more than their opponents/partners.  It's by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower of Babel is a quick playing game that lasts only 45 minutes or so with experienced players; of course a little longer with beginners.  We should be able to get two games in during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  This game is only good for 3, 4, or 5 players.  So if you want to play, get in fast.  If we don't have at least 3 RSVPs the day before the event, it'll be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send parking instructions and further info to "yes" RSVPs a few days before the event.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347337592000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343013513000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tower of Babel @ Mitch's  (2nd and 4th Monday Game Series)</name><id>74485942</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347318000000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/74485942/</event_url></item>
