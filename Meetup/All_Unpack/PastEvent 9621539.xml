As a single mother, she was fortunate to be able to count on the generosity of her family, friends, church, and coworkers. But she knows that many families have not been as fortunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a day care professional, Stairs has seen time-and-again kids whose only daily meal is served in the classroom. Several years ago, after seeing a small boy try to put mashed potatoes in his pocket to take home to his sister, Stairs made it her mission to do whatever she could to help end hunger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, in celebration of her fiftieth birthday, Stairs has decided to give a gift to the Open Pantry of Greater Lowell. On Saturday, February 21st at 7:30 pm she will host a 50’s sock hop dance to benefit the food pantry. Held at &lt;a href="http://www.wewelcomeall.org" target="_blank"&gt;Christ Church United, UCC&lt;/a&gt;, at 180 E. Merrimack Street, Lowell, near Saints Medical Center, the dance will feature 50’s music, a silent auction, raffle, refreshments, and bake sale. In attendance as the honorary principal for the evening will be Lowell Mayor, Bud Caulfield. An appearance by Elvis is also expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets to the sock hop are $15.50 for adults and $5.50 for children under 12. Guests are encouraged to bring non-perishable food items. All proceeds will benefit the Open Pantry of Greater Lowell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those unable to attend the dance, but who still wish to contribute, may make monetary or food donations to the Open Pantry of Greater Lowell, 200 Central Street, Lowell, MA 01852, 978-453-6693, www.theopenpantry.org.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>8147055</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235936997000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Progressive Christians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Progressive-Christians-of-Greater-Lowell</urlname><id>1337984</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3000030518</group_lon><name>Progressive Christians of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233176040000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>50's Sock Hop to Benefit the Open Pantry of Greater Lowell</name><id>9621539</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235262600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Progressive-Christians-of-Greater-Lowell/events/9621539/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/1/3/global_6628883.jpeg</photo_url></item>
