 RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT! &lt;br /&gt;

 Time to get back in shape for biking. Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go for a bike ride on the Nashua River Rail Trail. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I thought that we would bike for about an hour. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will meet at 6:00pm sharp, at the S. Depot Rd, Hollis NH location. Please follow these directions. Take Route 111 West into Hollis. When in Hollis, take Route 111A East. The trail is next to the Amerigas propane tank. I will have a Meetup sign. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please remember to bring your insect repellent and plenty of fluids. &lt;br /&gt;

 This event is at no cost! I hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;

 Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897 &lt;br /&gt;
