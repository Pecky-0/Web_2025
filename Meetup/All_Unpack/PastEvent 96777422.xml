Windblown will open this weekend and I'm planning to spend a couple of hours skiing on Sunday. We will break into groups based on ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to leave Boston around 8:45 and can take a couple of riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windblown is the ultimate New England cross country ski experience with a wonderful lodge, bring your lunch or buy it there (I'm pretty sure they will have the cafe fully open but call to be sure if you are not bringing lunch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start at 11 am and will be just outside the lodge at the ski rack ready to ski, sorry we cannot wait for you but it is cold and we need to get moving to stay warm! Arrive early so you can buy your trail pass and get ready to ski before we meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow at least 1.5 hours driving time from the Boston area. Trail passes were $18--CASH OR CHECK ONLY!!! Rentals available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact each other for carpooling! Use the discussion board!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>2015761</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357062716000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356666024000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Windblown on Sunday!</name><id>96777422</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356883200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/96777422/</event_url></item>
