Thank you Mahesh for welcoming us in your home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup will be a potluck. Bring what you can but make sure it is vegan so everyone can have some. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is out of the way for most members but if you need a ride we have someone coming from Nashua and who is willing to give a ride to anyone along the way. Maybe others will come and offer rides. I live in Raymond so I am not much help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be fun and it will give us a chance to discuss the name change and anything else that may be on your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Linda Dionne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mahesh will give directions to anyone who asks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Dionne</member_name><member_id>6923926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365646527000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220557833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Area Vegan/Animal Rights Meetup</name><id>8689347</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222628400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/8689347/</event_url></item>
