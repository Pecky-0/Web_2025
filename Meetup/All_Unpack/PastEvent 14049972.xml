Join us even if you weren't planning to be at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/calendar/13804145/"&gt;Beaching for Justice&lt;/a&gt;. Arrive by yourself or bring your hungry friends!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP so we have an accurate head count for the restaurant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JP Seafood serves traditional American breakfast dishes PLUS you can choose from their sushi menu.  Including lots of vegan/vegetarian options. From personal experience and based on reviews &lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2008/12/05/brunch-jp-seafood-cafe.php"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; we know you're going to enjoy it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further if you're seeking like-minded folks to share a side of pancakes with, want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while enjoying omelets or savoring sushi, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in. If you want to build a strong cross-issue social justice movement, SoJust is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free parking is available behind the restaurant or across the street in the lot behind the liquor store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearest T stop is Green Street on the Orange line.
