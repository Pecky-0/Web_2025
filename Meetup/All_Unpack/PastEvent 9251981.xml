We know it is tough to find time for a Meetup in December but after our first meeting on November 22nd at the Garden Grille Cafe we want to keep the momentum going!  I look forward to seeing everyone I met on the 22nd and I am also excited to meet our new members.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to have a potluck.  I will be making Vegan Chili, if you would like to bring a dish (optional) please make sure that it is Vegan.  I look forward to seeing everyone on December 14th.  Please remember to RSVP and feel free to bring a friend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I-95 to exit 6 (the exit &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; 6a)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right at end of ramp (on to Route 3 North)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight through first stop light &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just before second stop light, turn Left on Magnolia Drive (look for Wood Estates sign)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Right on to Rustic Way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left on to Circlewood Drive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second house on Right â€“ 39 Circlewood Drive   (Beige raised ranch)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you need any additional information.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kerrie Amatelli</member_name><member_id>2732003</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin</member_name><member_id>7947968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232231712000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Vegetarian/Vegan Enthusiast</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood</urlname><id>1312890</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Vegetarian and Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228075238000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our Second Vegetarian/Organic Meetup is Schedule for December 14th at 4:00p.m!</name><id>9251981</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229288400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood/events/9251981/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/2/8/global_6156808.jpeg</photo_url></item>
