The earth giving birth to life all around, the trees appear to be bursting into green so quickly that you can watch the leaves grow as they reach for the warmth of the sun after a long hard winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again we will be hosting the Sunday morning service at the UUC of Haverhill. Service starts at 10:30 followed by an indoor Maypole Dance and Celebration at coffee hour, all culminating with the coronation of the King and Queen of the Mayfair! Music, Laughter and Merriment for All!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are encouraged to wear robes or ren-fair outfits, bring instruments or noise makers, and celebrate the season with friends and friends you have yet to meet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admission is a non-perishable food item for the local food pantry, and all are encouraged to bring a snack to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks again to truly be a Merry Meet!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304348104000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302100960000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beltane &amp; Pagan Pride Celebration!</name><id>17204940</id><headcount>150</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304260200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/17204940/</event_url></item>
