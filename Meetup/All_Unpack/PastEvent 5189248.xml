They are experts in designing and installing solar systems here in Maine and are in the process of opening up a branch in the Portland area.   We will hear about available technology, costs, incentives, etc. for SOLAR HOT WATER SYSTEMS for your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 6:30 for potluck dinner as always...followed by the presentation for about 45-60 minutes starting around 7:00 or 7:15.  We should be able to open it up to discussion and questions around 8:00 or shortly thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that we will have more attendance at this event than we can manage with a house meeting, so we will be meeting at Zero Station in Portland.  We have also invited members of the Oil Awareness Meetup, the Alternative Energy Study Group and CitizenSalon.org.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1163783699000</updated><rating><average>4.63000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160523305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portland Maine Permaculture November Meetup</name><id>5189248</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163547000000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/5189248/</event_url></item>
