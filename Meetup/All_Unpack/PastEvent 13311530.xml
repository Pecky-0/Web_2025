I am still in search for a new place to meet in Brookline that is near the T and also has parking. If you can think of a place, please let me know. The public library would charge me to use their meeting rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet to chat about our successes and struggles in recent weeks. regarding our common mission.  We will meet on the patio on the left side.  If it is really warm out, we might go down to the Devotion School yard just past Zaftigs.  I will send my cell phone number to those that RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanessa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be sitting in the middle of the patio.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273273461000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Accountability Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>declutter-113</urlname><id>963536</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Tools for Decluttering, Personal Change &amp; Goal Attainment</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272409196000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Panera Bread</name><id>13311530</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273100400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/declutter-113/events/13311530/</event_url></item>
