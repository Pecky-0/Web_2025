<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I would like to use this week as a chance to explore a new park. I'll add the time and location as I receive some feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a park you have heard about, but not explored? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10/10 - We have a location: Knapp Town Forest (Duxbury Forest). Details to follow....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/11/10 - We will meet at one of the 2 small parking lots on Mayflower Street. We should try to park at the longer lot. I will have a green Chevy pickup. Kate, one of our members, will be in a blue Jeep Cherokee. If you have any trouble please feel free to call my cell 508-510-1136&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan for 2 hours in the woods. Any questions feel free to email me.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263913478000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262443847000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Hiking</name><id>12196793</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263740400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/12196793/</event_url></item>
