<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>So, I totally missed out on this clinic last year when Kyle organized it, and my bike (still not ridable by the way) has certainly played the role of the victim.  This year, I am free from work and heading to Framingham to try and make amends and actually attempt to get out on two wheels this summer.  Figured I'd throw it on the calender in case there are those equally un-savvy in the world of bike maintenance who might like to join me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description provided by REI is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Learn how to diagnose your bike's needs to get it ready for those long days of biking you have ahead of you. An REI Technician will go over practical applications in regards to season long maintenance for wheel and tires, drive train, and brakes. If you are tired of having to take your bike in to the shop every time you get a flat, this is the class for you. Clinic is FREE and open to all, but space will be limited, so contact REI Framingham Customer Service today to reserve your spot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, it is free, but space is limited and registration is required.  Call 508-270-6325 to secure your spot (hit &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; to speak to a salesperson).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions and details are available off REI Framingham's website: &lt;a href="http://www.rei.com/stores/57" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rei.com/st...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the wise suggestion of one of our most faithful members, let's hit the Cheesecake Factory near the Natick Mall after the clinic.  This'll give us the choice of dinner, or, if already partaken, a huge piece of cheesecake to inspire us to, well, start biking:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cheesecake Factory&lt;br /&gt;Natick Collection, 1245 Worcester Street, Natick, MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;(508) 653-0011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mapquest link with directions from REI: &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?zoom=7&amp;amp;http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;latitude=&amp;amp;longitude=&amp;amp;name=&amp;amp;phone=&amp;amp;level=&amp;amp;addtohistory=&amp;amp;cat=&amp;amp;address=1245+Worcester+Street&amp;amp;city=Natick&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;zipcode=01760#a/maps/l::375+Cochituate+Rd:Framingham:MA:01701-4653:US:42.305192:-71.395465:address:Middlesex+County/l::1245+Worcester+St:Natick:MA:01760-1515:US:42.299233:-71.385213:address:Middlesex+County/m:null:12:42.303875:-71.38754:0:0:/io:1:::::f:EN:M:/e" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone in the area wants to join us just for dinner/dessert, we should be there between 8:30-8:45 p.m..  &lt;br /&gt;Drop me an email and we'll coordinate finding each other.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa/vetchick</member_name><member_id>4120480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206054137000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204481862000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Basic Bike Maintenance Clinic at REI Framingham/ Cheesecake Factory</name><id>7446663</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205881200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/7446663/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/2/global_2186386.jpeg</photo_url></item>
