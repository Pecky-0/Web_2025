Reports are scattered at this point, but seem to suggest an encounter with a hostile alien lifeform - Command is denying anything of the sort, of course. We've been sent in to check things out, but I've got a really bad feeling about this...there were almost a thousand people down there, and there's no way they would all go quiet that quickly unless there's something very wrong...&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your NERF blaster and get ready to plunge into unknown space in this day-long adventure for ages 6+! Event runs from 9-3, with early drop off and late pickup available (additional fees apply). NERF blasters available for lease; we provide all darts. Call us at 781-270-4800 to pre-register; $60/member, $75/nonmember.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295273873000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292962840000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NERF All Day Adventure: The Third Kind</name><id>15791840</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295269200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/15791840/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/e/global_6162670.jpeg</photo_url></item>
