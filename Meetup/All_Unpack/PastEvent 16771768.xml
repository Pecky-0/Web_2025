With: Aleksandr Antonov, Vladimir Barsky and Grigori Aleksandrov. Cinestudio is thrilled to present the new 35mm (film!) restoration of Sergei Eisenstein's masterpiece of revolutionary art, Battleship Potemkin. For the first time since the 1925 Moscow premiere, all of Eisenstein&amp;iacute;s original shots are intact, and the original Edmund Meisel score has been recorded by the Deutsches Filmorchestra. Made as a tribute to the mutiny of sailors onboard a Czarist battleship, it is best known for its much-imitated 'Odessa steps massacre' sequence, that critic James Agee called "a few minutes in cinema as brilliantly organized as a movement in a Beethoven symphony." Besides stirring up anti-authoritarian fervor around the world (it was banned in Britain until 1954), Eisenstein inspired filmmakers with his masterful use of editing to create drama. Don't miss a rare chance to see Potemkin on film, in a theater!
