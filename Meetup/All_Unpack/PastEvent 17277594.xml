<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Storytelling in the grand manner, The Secret History is a debut  remarkable for its hypnotic erudition and acute psychological suspense,  and for the richness of its emotions, ideas, and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These are  the confessions, years afterward, of a young man who found at a small  Vermont college the life of privilege and intellect he'd long coveted -  and rarely has the glorious experience of youth infatuated with  knowledge and with itself been so achingly realized. Then, amazed,  Richard Papen is drawn into the ultimate inner circle: five students,  worldly and self-assured, selected by a charismatic classics professor  to participate in the search for truth and beauty. Together they study  the mysteries of ancient Greek culture and spend long weekends at an old  country house, reading, boating, basking in an Indian summer that  stretches late into autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mesmerized by his new comrades, Richard  is unaware of the crime which they have committed in his dreamy,  unwitting presence. But once taken into their confidence, he and the  others slowly and inevitably begin to believe in the necessity of  murdering the one classmate and friend who might betray both their  secret and their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugely ambitious and compulsively readable,  this is a chronicle of deception and complicity, of Dionysian abandon,  of innocence corrupted by self-love and moral arrogance; and, finally,  it is a story of guilt and responsibility. An astonishing achievement by  any standard, The Secret History immediately establishes Donna Tartt as  a supremely gifted novelist.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Location TBA</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annie</member_name><member_id>1543974</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1315268119000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paradisecityreaders</urlname><id>1404829</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Paradise City Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302625715000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September 5: The Secret History, Donna Tartt</name><id>17277594</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315263600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paradisecityreaders/events/17277594/</event_url></item>
