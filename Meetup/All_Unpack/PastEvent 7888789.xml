Everyone enjoyed what they ordered : ) &lt;br /&gt;This Vietnamese restaurant is reasonably priced. They serve beer &amp;amp; wine and some exotic non- lacohol drinks.. Try the Sparkling Lime : ) Delicious!  There is ample parking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am not sure if they will do separate checks?  So, if this is the case, I hate to ask but...  please make sure you bring enough cash to pay your bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE:IF YOU JUST WANT TO JOIN US FOR DINNER, AND NOT GILREIN'S .. NO PROBLEM : ) I will try to be there earlier . Depending on how many respond I will work on a reservation. &lt;br /&gt;             Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;             _Jo&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>When entering the restaurant ask for the meetup table.
