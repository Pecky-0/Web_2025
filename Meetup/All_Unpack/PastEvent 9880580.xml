These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It’s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Movie Description:&lt;/b&gt;  Oprah Winfrey narrates this inspirational look at living with a disability in Ghana, as seen through the eyes of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, who was born with a badly deformed right leg. While most of the nation's 2 million citizens who are deemed &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot; suffer discrimination, abandonment and ridicule, Emmanuel has dedicated his life to traveling the country via bicycle to open people's minds and to transform lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is free, but donations are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the Orange line.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244072175000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236193153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie:  Emmanuel's Gift</name><id>9880580</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242430200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/9880580/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/c/global_7545484.jpeg</photo_url></item>
