Great English fare...beautiful outdoor views from the patio...terrific company...a great selection of ales...are all a sampling of what we will enjoy here at &amp;quot;the pub&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be enjoying this great little &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; that boasts so much of the fine history of the area with superior antiques and memorabilia. The food features superb dishes, with an English flair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard wonderful things about this restaurant/pub and can't wait to explore and share with all my friends, new and old. Come join us for a unique experience. You can have dinner, or an appetizer, or simply an ale...we would love to have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what The Stamford Advocate, Oct 2009, had to say about The White Horse... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The White Horse, A Country Pub &amp;amp; Restaurant, is a rare and precious find located on Route 202, Marbledale, CT in the Township of Washington , and formerly known as The Marbledale Pub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owner John Harris has tastefully displayed his British roots throughout the two dining areas, stocking them with antiques, artifacts and local art. With one side of the restaurant having more of a &amp;quot;feminine feel&amp;quot; and the other a masculine. The pub's official birthday took place on June 25th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &amp;quot;Village gathering place,&amp;quot; where one could experience pub fare married to reasonable pricing. Diners can feast on starters like Clams Casino, for lunch one can try on a Cab Burger, traditional pub dishes have also been kicked up a notch and for dinner, try their Steakhouse Shepherds Pie or Superior Fish and Chips.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Marianne or Terri, or the Meetup sign...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279550968000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278432051000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet us at the pub...The White Horse Country Pub, that is... </name><id>14016243</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279490400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/14016243/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/f/global_16236927.jpeg</photo_url></item>
