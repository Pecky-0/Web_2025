It is a bonus cooking club event for December! &lt;br /&gt;A lot of our regulars could not come on a Sunday in December, so I've chosen a Saturday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme is wrapped food so each thing we eat is a little gift of food. Just this one time - let's make it more potluck and do the majority of the cooking before arrival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want or need to cook on site that is, of course, alright. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to start earlier at 6:30PM and go until it is over. My hope is that even if you have a later party that day you'll come to cooking club first!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!If you want to help me decorate the tree come as early as 4:30PM!! Please! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come celebrate the holiday and our two years of cooking club friendships! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send the address a few days before the event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261438904000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259027043000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Wrap Party</name><id>11943530</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261265400000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/11943530/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/7/global_11964439.jpeg</photo_url></item>
