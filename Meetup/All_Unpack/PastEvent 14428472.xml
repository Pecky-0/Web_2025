The Meetup will be on Friday, Sept. 24.**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Shepard's plays are never boring. &amp;quot;A Lie of the Mind&amp;quot; has won a ton of awards, and Brown always does such a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Buy your tickets soon!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are now on sale. It's General Admission, so please buy your own ticket from &lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Theatre_Speech_Dance/about/boxoffice.html" target="_blank"&gt;Brown &lt;/a&gt;- either online, by phone or in person. Don't wait - Brown's plays always sell out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play starts at 8 pm. We will meet in the lobby of the Leeds Theatre in Lyman Hall at &lt;b&gt;7:15&lt;/b&gt; so we can get seats together. I will be holding a small red &amp;amp; white Meetup sign. Lyman Hall is set back from Waterman Street - here is a &lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Facilities_Management/docs/PAUR_Campus_Map.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;campus map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Dining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the play, we will head around the corner to &lt;a href="http://www.andreasri.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas&lt;/a&gt; for dinner/apps/drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;Here's a summary of the play:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in three acts set in the gritty American West, the story alternates between two families after a severe incident of spousal abuse leaves all their lives altered until the final collision at an isolated cabin. The two families, one composed of Baylor, Meg, Beth, and Mike, the other composed of Lorraine, Sally, Frankie, and Jake are connected by the marriage of Jake and Beth, whose beating and subsequent hospitalization at the hands of Jake initiates the beginning of the play. Exploring family dysfunction and the nature of love, the play follows Jake as he searches for meaning after Beth, and her family, as they struggle with Beth's brain damage.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286036890000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281889603000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Lie of the Mind - Brown University</name><id>14428472</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285370100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/14428472/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/b/global_17197755.jpeg</photo_url></item>
