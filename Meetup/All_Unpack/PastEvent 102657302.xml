&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to those who were able to join us last month at Scholars. Thanks to a great response we doubled our attendance from the previous month. Can we double again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember we are trying to let Boston know who really lives here. Come out and be visible with us! Invite you're friends and colleagues --and anyone interested in creating more inclusive social spaces here in The Hub, especially in the after-work crowd. That includes White allies who understand our larger mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact: Boston is 47% White and 53% Black, Latino,Asian, Native American and everything else outside of and in between. And we all work live and play here.&lt;/p&gt;
