Among many other jobs with the ACLU nationally, Andrew was Development Director in Connecticut for several years before leaving to become Executive Director in West Virginia, a post he held for six years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Program committee chair David Schafer told Andrew Schneider that we'd like to hear about recent ACLU activities in the state and nation, and about his plans for the coming year.  Andrew responded that the title of his talk would be &amp;quot;Can Conservatives Find Happiness In The ACLU?&amp;quot; Whether this has anything to do with the recent Hartford Courant article claiming that &lt;a href="http://www.acluct.org/aboutacluct/pressroom/susancampbellonaclu.htm" target="_blank"&gt;the ACLU is not one-sided&lt;/a&gt; we'll find out during the talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talk will be held on a Sunday afternoon to accommodate the schedule of our speaker.  We'll start with coffee and conversation at 3:00 PM.  The main program will follow brief announcements at 3:30 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It is not necessary to RSVP for this event; I'm listing it as a meetup so you can use meetup's RSVP system get e-mail reminders from meetup.com)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195589285000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193955568000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Can Conservatives Find Happiness In The ACLU?</name><id>6658441</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195416000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/6658441/</event_url></item>
