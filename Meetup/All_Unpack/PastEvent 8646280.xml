Several strip malls.&lt;br /&gt;3. Eventually you'll find a SMALL sign to your right at a fork in the road marked &amp;quot;Wayside Inn&amp;quot;. Take that fork right.&lt;br /&gt;5. Continue straight about 1/2 mile or so. The Mill will be on your left. There should be quite a few cars parked there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO BRING WHICH ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN: &lt;br /&gt;                        Mosquito repellant,  Paper towels,  Sweater, water, food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAR-POOL: If you need a ride or are willing to drive, say so in your RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAX: We allow a leisurely 30 minutes for late-ness. If you show up within 30 minutes of the scheduled time you are fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLEMENT WEATHER: It is up to you to determine if the weather makes painting untenable. Although, I will try to leave a message on my voice mail if I myself do not intend to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220465660000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220013968000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PLEIN AIR OUTING: Wayside Inn Mill</name><id>8646280</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220292000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/8646280/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/c/global_1743932.jpeg</photo_url></item>
