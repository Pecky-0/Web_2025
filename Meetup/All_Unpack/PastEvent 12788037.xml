Well worth the trip, so come join us!  Quite rare to find a Turkish place outside of New Haven and this one seems to be the best of the lot. The New Haven Advocate has a write-up you can read by clicking this link: &lt;a href="http://www.newhavenadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=8907" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newhavenad...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup will be hosted by Megan and I will forward any emails you send to her.  Looks like plenty of parking, and the restaurant is on the off ramp (Plank Rd) from I84 East - exit 25.  If you are coming West on I84 - on the exit 25 ramp take a left at the Super 8 onto Scott Rd crossing the highway, next left puts you on Plank Rd.  So easy to get to!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Ethnic Dining &amp;quot;Rules&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If you RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; you are expected to SHOW UP!!! Be polite and make sure you change your RSVP by 1:00pm March 30th if need be.  If you have to cancel or want to add yourself at the last minute call the restaurant to let them know (203) 591-8450&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Please bring cash, it is so much quicker and easier.  Remember, no one leaves until the bill is paid - this is respect for the event's host and the other diners.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I will collect $1.00 from each participant for Meetup fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) This is a great group, we have a wonderful time at these events so let's keep the Organizer happy - come make me smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Betsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation under "Meetup/Megan"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Megan</member_name><member_id>7688928</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270328601000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267752253000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anatolia Restaurant 03/31/10 6:45pm Wednesday</name><id>12788037</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270075500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/12788037/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
