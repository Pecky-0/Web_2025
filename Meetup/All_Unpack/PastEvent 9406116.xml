But humans will not give in to fear. The Heartless march on to destroy all that we love. Guardians from all across the land will push back the Heartless to once they came. Easily can the shadows of darkness take over. With friends and allies at your side, the light will shine a new path to lock away the Heartless. What do you fight for? Who do you fight for? What lies inside your heart?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Pre Reg*: $15/members and friends $20/non &lt;br /&gt;At Door: $20/members and friends $30/non &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous swordsmanship experience is not required. We provide the padded weapons (and spell packets). This is a family event with adults, teens and kids (ages 6+). If not in costume, Sweats and T-shirts are suggested. No shorts or tanktops allowed. Under 18 must have signed waiver by parents. 18 and over must have their own signed waiver. Waivers can be downloaded here: &lt;a href="http://www.guardup.net/sword/documents/event_waiver.doc" target="_blank"&gt;Waiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $15 for Meet Up members (and their friends) who pre-register ($20 for non). Pre-registration required as these events DO fill up and we cannot take anyone else after our capacity is reached. To pre-register you must call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead with a credit card or cash. Make sure to tell them that &amp;quot;Meghan sent you&amp;quot; so that you get the Meet Up rate which is the same as the Member Rate (a savings of $5). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: RSVP with YES does NOT PRE-REGISTER. You MUST call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead to complete the pre-registration process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At-Door is $20 and you may be turned away if there is not enough room. Since we fill up before the event more than 1/2 the time, pre-registration is highly recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to be ontime for required safety instruction at start of event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the front desk... they can help you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meghan</member_name><member_id>5106555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235262377000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230611502000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Battle Night: Revelation of a Hero</name><id>9406116</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233964800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/9406116/</event_url></item>
