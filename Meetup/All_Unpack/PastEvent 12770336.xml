This is a charity breakfast, which my company sponsors, so all attendees wll be invited for breakfast during the meeting.  Pancakes, eggs, sausage, muffins, coffee, juice, etc are all served. For more information please contact Paul at PaulPSWJC@aol.com. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, it's our regular committee meeting  -  just over brunch because Paul has free tickets. Bring a friend if you like, we'll just need a half hour or so to talk business. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Petrillo</member_name><member_id>8764866</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269690402000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267636621000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paws in the Park Committee Meeting</name><id>12770336</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269183600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/12770336/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/6/global_13437702.jpeg</photo_url></item>
