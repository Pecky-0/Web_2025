Jacques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biography&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qadim is a word found in both Arabic and Hebrew meaning 'ancient' as well as 'that which will come.' Their repertoire includes Arabic, Jewish, Turkish Sufi, Hebrew-Yemenite, Armenian, Greek and Moroccan music, celebrating the common musical and spiritual heritage of the region's cultures, while honoring the great diversity found within them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed for their passionate performances, Qadim is comprised of an ensemble of accomplished and acclaimed musicians. The San Francisco Bay Area-based group has attracted a growing global audience who are responding to their authentic musicianship and timely message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qadim was recently featured on NPR &amp;quot;All Things Considered&amp;quot; and are currently #7 on the Billboard World Music Chart.&lt;br /&gt;The gig listing is here: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/artist/eliyahuandqadim.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.johnnyds.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band's website is here: &lt;a href="http://www.qadimmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.qadimmusic...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!
