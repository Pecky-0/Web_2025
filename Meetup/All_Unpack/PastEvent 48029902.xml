Its percentile-based system is easy to learn and fun to play. The game was one of the first horror-themed RPGs and focuses on investigation and wits alongside combat to fight the evil monster(s) from the unknown. Players portray envoys working for the organization SAVE, which stands for Societas Argenti Viae Eternitata or The Eternal Society of the Silver Way. This secret organization is dedicated to protecting the world from the evil creatures that have leaked their way in from another dimension or world SAVE calls THE UNKNOWN. A letter from SAVE Headquarters in Toronto sends you on a unique mission to confront the &amp;quot;Overlook Ghost.&amp;quot; For more than 150 years, this creature has appeared on the night of July 19/20 in the Overlook Room of McClellan Manor in the small town of Bannockburn, Ontario. Any person in the room at any time on that night dies, horribly and mysteriously. SAVE believes this creature can be destroyed if someone survives the night of July 19/20 in the Overlook Room. Your mission is to investigate the creature and then, boldly risking your lives, spend the night in the Overlook Room. Is SAVE correct in destroying the Overlook Ghost by spending the night? Could there be other ways of dealing with the Overlook Ghost? Do you dare find out?! Characters are provided. Please bring dice and a pencil. 5 Player Max 3 Player Min Without 3 this meetup will not take place.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327299308000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326507557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chill RPG "A Little Room"</name><id>48029902</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326927600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/48029902/</event_url></item>
