&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Erb Photography focuses on advertising, editorial, commercial portraiture and product work with a specialization in food, restaurant and hospitality clients. And in the last few years they have carved out a niche in restaurant photography in New England.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join us for an open conversation about food photography and working with restaurants. Hear about the challenges, see the results. They will be showing images of food and chefs and then sharing stories about the challenges they have faced taking on this kind of photographic work. They will share insights on how to make your own food photography better, and answer any questions you may have about doing this kind of work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
