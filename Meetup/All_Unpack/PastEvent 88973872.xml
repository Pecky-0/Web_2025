<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;see a film or two; I have a few in mind... a pair of fun ones... THE PRINCESS BRIDE... SNEAKERS... HOOSIERS... THE USUAL SUSPECTS... i mentioned the Princess Bride to someone, and they'd never seen it. Rob Reiner's film is 25 yrs old, and a classic. includes Billy Crystal, Andre the Giant, Manny Patankin, Fred Savage, Peter Falk, and others in comedic roles. I could run it from my house or someone with more seating space have a good TV? Anyone with suggestions? Suggest a date. A Friday night, or a Saturday afternoon and evening for a double header??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can fit 15 comfortably seated on couch, chairs, and on floor... after that, a few more chairs can be place behind the couch, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have to set up a waiting list.. dont know how yet&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick Clark</member_name><member_id>17851281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354499702000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351474344000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Get together and watch a film or two, have some eats.</name><id>88973872</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354399200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/88973872/</event_url></item>
