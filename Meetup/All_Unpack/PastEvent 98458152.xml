The road is closed during the winter so we will have to hike a ways to get to the trailhead. Will most likely need snow shoes and you will definitely want micro spikes. Not sure how often this is hiked during the winter. I am guessing parking will be very limited so I would encourage car pooling if you want to go. While the summit is fairly low in elevation it is open so you may want a face mask.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358014001000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357602794000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Cardigan Mountain</name><id>98458152</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358002800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/98458152/</event_url></item>
