Wonderful art inside the Koch Gallery, mellow music, sundowners and tasty tapa's from the cash bar and the entertaining company and conversation of many of Boston's socially active singles are what you will find at this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The March event music will be live - &lt;a href="http://www.fourpiecesuit.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Four Piece Suit&lt;/a&gt; - so if you're into jazz, blues, swing, funk or rock, as well as art, you will have the best of both worlds on March 6th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow away the winter blahs with culture and style.... &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional information, see the MFA web-site at: &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/calendar/sub.asp?key=12&amp;amp;subkey=73" target="_blank"&gt;MFA First Fridays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet up with your Hostess (Robyn) at the &lt;b&gt;MFA FENWAY entrance&lt;/b&gt; at 6:00pm, or find us inside the MFA thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;[NOTE: &lt;b&gt;The West Wing entrance is closed from March 2nd&lt;/b&gt;].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP a firm Yes or No by Friday noon so that the Organizer knows roughly how many / who to expect at the event.
