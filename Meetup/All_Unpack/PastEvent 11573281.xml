It is is a free, first-step family literacy program for adults and their children based at public libraries throughout Rhode Island. RIFLI offers English as a Second Language (ESL), citizenship preparation and computer instruction as well as children's programming, student resource support and links to library resources and services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help support this cause by attending their 2nd annual fundraiser at the Hi-Hat in Providence. There will be live music, dancing and a penny social (aka Chinese raffle). It's a family friendly evening for all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Latin Band will be performing, and there will be a salsa lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To purchase tickets, call 401-455-8185. Adults $10 advanced ($15 at door). Kids are free. Free parking. Each person is responsible for obtaining their own ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Info: &lt;a href="http://www.rifli.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rifli.org/...&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.thehihat.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thehihat.c...&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebostonlatinband" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257191983000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254940979000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2nd Annual RIFLI Fundraiser</name><id>11573281</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256504400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11573281/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
