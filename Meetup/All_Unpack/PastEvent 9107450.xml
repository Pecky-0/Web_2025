Just because it's getting colder doesn't mean we shouldn't get outside and enjoy the light of day, the woodland air, and the trees!  Let's walk away our late fall blues at Sleeping Giant, in the company of friends.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at Sleeping Giant, which is a Connecticut State Park located in Hamden.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN: Sleeping Giant is a great park for any level of hiking.  We'd like to walk the tower trail, which is relatively short, has a mild incline, and requires little maneuvering over rocky places.  We will split up after our break at the tower, some members walking back down the tower road, and other members heading down the blue trail, for a greater challenge. The two groups will converge at the parking lot after the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the entrance, which is located on Mt. Carmel Avenue, between 7:45 and 8, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by 8:15. This particular hike shouldn't take more than 2.5 hours, with the break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: water! (And a snack if you like.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads;  layers of warm clothing;  a hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website. Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. Your donations will also help to sustain the group through the winter months, when we have limited attendance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please see link below. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: The DEP charges a fee to park in the lot.  Please take advantage of the street parking on Mt. Carmel Avenue, adjacent to park, ACROSS FROM (not inside) Quinnipiac University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to park website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/Dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325264" target="_blank"&gt;Sleeping Giant State Park Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer (Sarah) will be wearing a red sweatshirt and a winter hat.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229179459000</updated><rating><average>3.79999995232</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225996367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Early-bird Hiking December Meetup</name><id>9107450</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228568400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/9107450/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/4/global_6216756.jpeg</photo_url></item>
