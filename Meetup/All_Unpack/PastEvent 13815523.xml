Let's ride them down the Minuteman Trail this Sunday morning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet me at 8:45am Sunday morning at the intersection of Alpine St and Cedar St. in Somerville.  To get to the starting point, you can ride your bike, take the T to Davis Square or find parking nearby.  The ride will be ~20 miles round-trip unless you want to turn back earlier on your own.  The Minuteman Trail used to be a railway, so it is very flat and straight and car-free.  We will ride between 10-15 MPH for about about two hours, and we can stop together for a snack at either end of the trail.  Please take time before coming to pump up your tires.  Inspect them for glass or other punctures.  Check your brakes and anything else that might need maintenance before the ride.  I will bring a hand pump and tools to change a tube. It is always a good idea to have a spare tube when you ride.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the forecast is clear or light rain, I will ride, but call me at 857.244.1357 if the morning looks very wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuteman info: &lt;a href="http://www.minutemanbikeway.org/Pages/intro.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.minutemanb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail beginning: &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=7+Sherman+St,+Charlestown,+Suffolk,+Massachusetts+02129&amp;amp;ll=42.394054,-71.111075&amp;amp;spn=0,0.001742&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=20&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;cbll=42.394031,-71.111067&amp;amp;panoid=NxhWop1Dgt71oRwGf8JHzg&amp;amp;cbp=12,286.28,,0,7.7" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail end: &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=7+Sherman+St,+Charlestown,+Suffolk,+Massachusetts+02129&amp;amp;ll=42.485828,-71.277226&amp;amp;spn=0.001543,0.003484&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=19" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277069459000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276657301000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Minuteman Trail bike ride</name><id>13815523</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277037900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/13815523/</event_url></item>
