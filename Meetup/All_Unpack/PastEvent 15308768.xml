We will get together at Hopedale only for the November meeting. Other meetings will take place at Borders in Shrewsbury as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Donna! It is very kind of you to host November meeting at your house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will email the address, parking info and Donna's cell phone number to book group members who RSPVed &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; for November meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a reminder about what we will do at November meeting;&lt;br /&gt;We'll discuss a &amp;quot;Mother Teresa&amp;quot; book. Any book about &amp;quot;Mother Teresa&amp;quot; is fine. You can get one from your library. We will take turns to talk about Mother Teresa and what we find in our books. If you cannot read a book, you can just sit, relax and listen the discussion. It is always good to get together and share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. Donna got the book “The Miracle of Love” about Mother Teresa of Calcutta , her Missionaries of Charity, and her Co-Workers*. She loves this book and suggests it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Celine</member_name><member_id>4475598</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290893081000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>newearth</urlname><id>1147858</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7200012207</group_lon><name>New Earth Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288698275000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November Meeting change of place</name><id>15308768</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290816000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newearth/events/15308768/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/2/global_12671298.jpeg</photo_url></item>
