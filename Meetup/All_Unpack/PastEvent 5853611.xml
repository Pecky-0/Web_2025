Tickets are on sale already for those of you who like to purchase them ahead of time.   I will, as ususal, be wearing a little movie badge so people new to the group can find me.  After the movie, for those who are interested,  we can go to a nearby restaurant and get some munchies and  beverages.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is called Ratatouille.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Academy AwardÂ®-winning director Brad Bird (&amp;quot;The Incredibles&amp;quot;) and the amazing storytellers at Pixar Animation Studios (&amp;quot;Cars,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Finding Nemo&amp;quot;) take you into an entirely new and original world where the unthinkable combination of a rat and a 5-star gourmet restaurant come together for the ultimate fish-out-of-water tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Ratatouille,&amp;quot; a rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great chef despite his family's wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in the city of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unwanted visitor in the kitchen at one of Paris' most exclusive restaurants, Remy forms an unlikely partnership with Linguini, the garbage boy, who inadvertently discovers Remy's amazing talents. They strike a deal, ultimately setting into motion a hilarious and exciting chain of extraordinary events that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the trailer go to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/ratatouille/" target="_blank"&gt;http://disney.go.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this posting closer to the event, when show times become available.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183415578000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181005267000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ratatouille</name><id>5853611</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183242600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5853611/</event_url></item>
