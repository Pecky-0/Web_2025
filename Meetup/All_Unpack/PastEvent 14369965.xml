<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>An invigorating pack walk is long overdue!&lt;br /&gt; Let's meet at the main parking lot at Houghton's pond at 9am Saturday, August 14th. The parking lot is located across from the State Police station on Hillside Street, Milton MA. The link to the park is posted below. Dogs are supposed to be leashed, don't forget to bring water for yourself and your dog and insect repellent may be a good idea. Some of the trails are rough so please wear appropriate footwear.  We will probably walk for about 1 1/2 hrs. I will be in the parking lot with a black lab and a schipperkee. We will start our walk at 9 am sharp so call if you are going to be late. 617-851-6510 Jacquie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/blue.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in the main parking lot across from the State Police station</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacqueline </member_name><member_id>7535746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281963302000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281386833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Houghton's Pond Pack Walk</name><id>14369965</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281790800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/14369965/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/b/global_8959179.jpeg</photo_url></item>
