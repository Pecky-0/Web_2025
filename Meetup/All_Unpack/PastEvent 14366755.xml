Sorry — no farm tours, and no pet animals are allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the process that takes raw fiber to a finished garment …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn about the many forms of fiber arts including weaving, knitting, felting, dyeing and more …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch angora spun straight from the rabbit’s back …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try your hand at weaving on one of our portable looms …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knitters, spinners, weavers, dyers, felters, rug hookers, basket weavers and fiber animals will all gather on Sunday, August 15 – 10 to 2- at Riverslea Farm. It will be a summer style Fuzz Fest. Fiber artists will be sharing their love of natural fiber with you, answering questions, helping you try their craft, and offering their wonderful hand made products for sale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hal's beloved rabbits will be there on his lap while he spins their fur into angora, a mother Shetland sheep and her baby will be with Mo as she spins their fleece into fine yarn, and Nicola will spin alpaca fleece as 3 of her alpaca stand by. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be weaving to watch and try, felting to do with hands and feet, a knitting circle to join along with knitting in the round, an artisan doing the ancient art of macrame, spinning wheels to buy, knitting spools, a weave-it and in the shop the wonderful fleeces and yarns and pelts from the Riverslea sheep. There will be a raffle to enter, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What better place for all this than a friendly farm in a beautiful corner of the Seacoast. Just off route 125 you will find a tranquil setting for this 4 hour get together.
