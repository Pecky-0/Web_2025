It sounds like a lot of fun so I am setting it up as a meetup.   I know, it's not a movie.  I can't believe I am actually saying this, but we are not entertained by movies alone!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tickets are $26, including fees, which is not bad for a live performance, but the show is for a very limited engagement and with the holiday theme and all, will probably sell out fast.   To buy tickets go to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&amp;amp;e=d86e78f29510a41c476c8e96b07cea29" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.vendini.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep you rsvp's up to date and include a message that you bought your ticket.   Also, please be on time if you want to sit with the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be in the lobby by 7:15, with my meetup sign and pin.  It is general admission seating, so we need to go in for seats by 7:30 at the latest, so we can all sit together.   Actual showtime is 8PM.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking in Davis Square can be tricky.  Sommerville just changed the rules so that meters and business parking are free after 8PM, instead of the 6 PM it use to be.   I recommend taking the T.   The red line goes to Davis Square and there are several buses that go there as well.  Routes:  87, 88, 89, 94, 96.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup pin and a meetup sign and will be waiting inside in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293825826000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291394743000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Slutcracker</name><id>15631846</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292893200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/15631846/</event_url></item>
