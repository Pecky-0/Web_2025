&lt;p&gt;Host: Claire P. cell @ 603-247-0897  &lt;br /&gt; RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go hiking, snow shoeing, or cross country skiing on the trails at Mine Falls Park in Nashua.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two or three hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;This park is just full of beautiful views, so come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 1:00 pm in the lot at the end of Coliseum Ave, which is off of Rte 130 in Nashua. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Take exit 6 from Route 3 (Route 130) and go west towards Brookline, take the second entrance to the shopping center area (Colliseum Ave), go all the way to the end of the road for the parking lot.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Look for the meetup sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone cares to, we can then go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a hot chocolate, at a nearby restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is at no cost.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297031137000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Let's burn all those calories we'll be eating at the Superbowl party tonight!</why><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296514071000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hiking, Snowshoeing or Cross Country Skiing at Mine Falls, Nashua NH</name><id>16388605</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297015200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/16388605/</event_url></item>
