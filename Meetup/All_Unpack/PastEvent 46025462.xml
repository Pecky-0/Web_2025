&lt;p&gt;This walk will be cancelled due to lack of interest or inclement weather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE NOTE: This was initially posted with Social Fun, another Meetup group, which has several members signed up to attend...hence the lower limit here.&amp;nbsp; Please pay $1 to help offset Meetup group dues when you arrive to this walk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325539603000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325299356000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Year's Day Walk at Ravenswood- with Social Fun</name><id>46025462</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325439000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/46025462/</event_url></item>
