&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I checked their website today and there ARE still seats available for this event, if you haven't gotten your ticket and you plan on coming then I suggest you do, there is no&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;guaranteeing if there will be tickets at the door!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do the time warp again (are you singing it?) on October 26 and watch the film version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show! Who would have thought? Certainly not young, and upcoming actors Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, and Tim Curry! But thirty years later, their campy little jaunt to the unique world of Dr. Frank-n-Furter – that sweet transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania – has become a legendary cult favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.17.12 Re the tickets: I have been in contact with the Firehouse I plan on getting tickets for those of you that can pay me ahead of time for your ticket.  As a policy I don't pay for tickets unless you have paid me and it is their policy that they don't hold seats unless they are paid for.  I have NO problem putting the tickets on my card, I have already checked and there are seats available around where Ann got her's.  So send me an email msdondon2003@yahoo.com to make arrangements to get me your money.  OR if you want to get your own ticket and sit on your own, no problem.  I will be calling them on 9/21 and giving them my card information.  The hall holds 195 people and they have already sold some, and promise that it will sell out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You loved it last year so why not join &lt;strong&gt;MC John Budzyna&lt;/strong&gt; again for this most tricked-out of all Halloween treats?!  Costumes are encouraged! A prop bag is included in the cost of the ticket, which is $16.00 and you are reasonable to get your own ticket.  Just so you know last year they sold out........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes you saw this correctly the Meetup time IS at 10:30pm and this show starts at 11:00PM.  So come on grab an extra cup of coffee or 2 and stay out late doing the time warp again as we watch the movie that is a legendary cult classic! With great friends, then this is the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
