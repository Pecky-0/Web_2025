Eastern Standard, in Kenmore Square, certainly qualifies. It boasts a French brasserie atmosphere with the most incredible repertoire of cocktails I've ever seen! I simply HAVE to find out what's in a Flying Dutchman, a Dancing Scotsman, a Pelican, and a Jalisco Bramble. . . and I'm afraid to ask about the Corpse Reviver! There's a lengthy list of wine and beer for the less adventurous, and an enticing menu that includes things like a foraged mushroom tart, duck confit ravioli, Colorado lamb sirloin, pork porterhouse. . . well, check out the web site and I'm sure you will be as intrigued as I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first event with us, please note that you must pay a reservation fee to RSVP. The fees will be added to the tip for the table, so you actually get them back if you attend (or if you cancel on or before January 28). Late cancellations will be out of luck as I had to use my credit card to reserve the table and will be charged accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation is in Iris's name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266681833000</updated><rating><average>4.44000005722</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261695976000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner -- by popular demand -- at Eastern Standard</name><id>12143770</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264888800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/12143770/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/1/global_11839713.jpeg</photo_url></item>
