These delicious treats are amazing mini versions of their entrees and priced just right....$3.50 each such as petite filet on garlic toast with bernaise and mini kobe burger to name two. They're ONLY served from 5 PM until 6:30 PM so get there in time to enjoy them. They also have created tasty sangrias red, white, sparkling, ros√© and blackberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join happy hour friends for conversation, laughs and good cheap eats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get there when you can. I'll arrive at 5 and hang until 7. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first new member who finds me, gets a free drink. Don't be shy...Say hi &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to create your route by public transit.
