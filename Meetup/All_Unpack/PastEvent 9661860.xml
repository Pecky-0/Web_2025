<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Greetings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just had our fifth Monday night mindfulness meetup group, and while we've had a nice variety of people, I also know that Monday nights is not always the best time for people. This is a chance for like-minded people to get together for a late morning/early afternoon gathering with good food and conversation. We can talk about activities or events we'd like to include in the meetup group, but mostly it's just about meeting folks who are interested in mindfulness and spiritual practice. I think building community is important and these meetups are a great way to get that started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you've got time, stop by and meet some neat people. The dress and gathering will be informal -- come as you are and bring a brunch/lunch food item. I'll provide some coffee, tea, and juice. Let me know if you have questions or comments about this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm regards,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=South+Portland&amp;amp;state=ME&amp;amp;address=10+Willard+Haven+Park&amp;amp;zipcode=04106" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be meeting people at the door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234282347000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233668804000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Brunch Pot Luck</name><id>9661860</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234108800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9661860/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
