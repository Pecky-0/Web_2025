It's Eurovision Song Contest time!!! Yes, it's corny, yes, it's kitch, and, yes, sometimes it makes you cringe...but you know you want to watch it. So, why not just give in. Let's get together on Saturday evening, 26 May, with a huge bowl of euro-pop...corn and watch the Euro lovefest that is Eurovision. One of the biggest Euro events of the year...described as being like a Euro Cup football match, but without the fighting. It seems that the contest will be live-streamed over the official Eurovision website. More info? It's all there on the official website; &lt;a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/page/baku-2012"&gt;http://www.eurovision.tv/page/baku-2012&lt;/a&gt;. To check out the stream, click on "webTV" at the top of that homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;À bientôt, &lt;br /&gt;
