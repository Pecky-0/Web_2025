Through a series of ''man-dates,'' he finds Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), and the pair become instant friends. But as Peter's ''bro-mance'' with Sydney grows stronger, it threatens his relationship with his fiancee (Rashida Jones), forcing Peter to make a choice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few early reviews I saw say this is a funny one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  This is opening weekend for the movie so I'd like to get seated early.  The movie time is 7:05 so please be there no later than 6:45.  If you arrive late and want to meet in the theater, call me at 203-812-0705.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner or drinks afterward?  Let me know if you're interested.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby.  Movie time is 7:05.
