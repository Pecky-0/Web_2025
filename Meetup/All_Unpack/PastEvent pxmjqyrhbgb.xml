The plan is to meet at the South End Cafe' inside the MOHR &amp;amp; McPherson Asian Antique Store.  The cafe' is great for coffee, tea, healthy desserts and quick sandwich meals.  The Store is great too!  We'll decide together which art galleries we want to visit as a group. This is great way to see really good local contemporary art without the First Friday crowds.  Some but not all the art studios are also open on Saturdays, so we might try them as well. We'll set out at 2:15 PM. If you're late, we'll leave word with the cafe' as to which galleries we'll going to. This will be regular on-going activity. FREE PARKING at 500 Harrison Ave. (just tell the attendant you are going to the galleries) and behind 450 Harrison Ave. (entrance from Albany Street).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you RSVP "yes" that means you will be attending. You can always change your RSVP if your plans change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
