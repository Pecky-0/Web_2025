&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: E&amp;amp;O Tap - on Knight Street (near the Avery) over on the West Side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E&amp;amp;O Tap is a FAVORITE with P-Collective Members! It's a little tough to find, but well worth it. Once you go, you will definitely be back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located in a neighborhood setting, its a small, one-story brick building that looks a little benign. Look for the cool sign over the doorway and the big, lit up E and O on the windows. Considered "a bit divey, but in a cool, hipster kinda way" and a great place to end a night on the West Side, its located in same area as the Avery. (you're almost an RI'er if you know where that is - I couldn't resist - LOL!). With your back to the Avery, go down the street to the end (Knight Street) and look left - there it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be forewarned, they don't serve food, but the bartender has a plethora of menus to pick from for delivery - so its kind of the best of both worlds.&lt;/strong&gt; Its been way TOO long since we've been back for an MNM! So, by Val's suggestion and popular demand, come over to E&amp;amp;O for some fun and good cheer this Monday night, and let's check it out! You'll be glad you did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Val is hosting this one!!!
