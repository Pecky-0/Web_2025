Discussion will include an overview of the history of mankind's innate ability to access non-ordinary states of consciousness for healing &amp;amp; self exploration, as well as recent research demonstrating the potential benefits of such states for individuals, groups, our entire society, and the planet. We will chart a course through humanity's relationship with ecstatic and mystical traditions from ancient shamanic cultures, through it's sometimes controversial relationship with modern society, religion, and psychotherapy, and conclude with the groundbreaking work of Stanislav Grof, MD and the development of Holotropic Breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshments will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event precedes a 1-day Holotropic Breathwork workshop (April 13th) being held at the same location. It is highly recommended that individuals registering for the workshop attend this talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366120639000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Healing Practitioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-healers-network</urlname><id>511093</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Healers Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1361030128000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Technologies of Ecstasy &amp; The Healing Potential of Non-Ordinary States</name><id>104884352</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365807600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-healers-network/events/104884352/</event_url></item>
