Parking is between Elm and Orchard st.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.burren.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Burren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Erlick has been playing gigs of several different generes (Jazz, Rock, blues etc) for years. &lt;br /&gt;To Learn more of Paul's musical influences and listen to some of his music checkout Paul's Myspace page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/paulerlich" target="_blank"&gt;Paul's MySpace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band starts around 9pm and plays till 1am. &lt;br /&gt;They are playing in the back room at the Burren.&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested the Burren serves food till 9pm I believe, not a bad place to get a bite to eat before the show. There is also good indian food, and other dinning choices close by. &lt;br /&gt;If there is enough interest we could make plans to get something to eat either at the Burren or elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me if your interested in gettting something to eat before the show.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to Meetup with some of you there. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E-mail me if you have any questions...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The back room at the Burren is not that big a venue. I should be easy to find there.  I would be glad to provide my cell phone to any meetup members that would like it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg D</member_name><member_id>4879355</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203732657000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Every band I have seen Paul play with has been well worth the effort to go see.
