Corporations create many products people disapprove of. Are companies immoral?  Do we need a Constitutional amendment to allow the state to censor speech by groups like corporations?   How to fix corporations?   Should they be allowed to sell things, such as violent video games, that many consider to be harmful?  Should CEO pay be limited by law?   What are the pros/cons?  What is case for the prosecution? What is the case for the defense? Let's put corporations on trial!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us at the large table in back.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim B</member_name><member_id>1113365</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1355683893000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352563311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The People vs. T.J.
