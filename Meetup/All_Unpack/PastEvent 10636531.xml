So, unfortunately, if you were hoping to sign up late there isn't any space left.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear a bright green/yellow running hat.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245539159000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244808026000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reggae Ramble on The Charles (Cambridge)</name><id>10636531</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245366000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10636531/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/9/global_9105689.jpeg</photo_url></item>
