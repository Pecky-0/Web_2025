Let me know if there is something we can improve upon. There's always something we could do better to make your experience more fulfilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be playing flag-football this Saturday at our usual time.  All are welcome to join us to get some exercise and have some friendly competition. Our main goal is to have fun. If you've never joined us, come on out this weekend. Its a great way to get some fresh air. Plus you will meet some good people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245514938000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243731927000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NOON SAT FLAG FOOTBALL RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>10533005</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244908800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/10533005/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/8/global_5593960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
