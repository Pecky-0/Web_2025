I am a GIGANTIC fan which is apparent because each time this group parties, I place it on the &lt;a href="http://portuguese.meetup.com/316/calendar/13969521//"&gt;Portuguese &lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonOnyxbirds/calendar/13969527"&gt;Onyxbirds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nightlife.meetup.com/421/calendar/13885300/"&gt;Happy Hour&lt;/a&gt; Meetup calendars because it always exceeded expectation. Let's pack the place again, because the more the merrier and also your presence will convince Ryles to keep the party on their schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you didn't get enough barbeque this weekend, this is your chance to get your fill. Here's the &lt;a href="http://www.rylesjazz.com/dining.cfm"&gt;Ryles Dinner Menu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil is a 12-piece percussion ensemble that always puts on a spectacular show combining traditional Brazilian grooves like Samba and Axé with Funk, Rock, Jazz and even Hip Hop; add to this, Ju Marciano's explosive mix of sultry vocals as well as beautiful dancers and you got a recipe for FUN, Brazilian style!! Bring your dance shoes or socks and leave your worries at the door!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your friends....I guarantee a funtastic time, that is if you like your music strong and your party loud. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get there when you can. Don't be shy...Say hi, to the friendly folks seated in the dining area at the tables against the wall, to the right of the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must be at least 21&lt;/b&gt; but you don't have to drink, just enjoy each others company and an AMAZING! show.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free Samba and Brazilian Afro Dance lesson at 9 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the drumming, singing and dancing start, group conversation is difficult. Let's just enjoy the party!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;$10 cash cover charge at the door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rylesjazz.com/month.cfm?month=07/2010"&gt;Ryles Concert Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.afrobrazil.org/index.php?CLm=07&amp;amp;CLd=9&amp;amp;CLy=2010&amp;amp;c_num=AB"&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER - THANK YOU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Points West:&lt;br /&gt;Take I-90 (Mass Pike) to Exit 18 bearing right toward Allston/Cambridge.
