I will be there about 7:15 pm.  Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes star in it.  Kate won the Oscar for Best Actress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE READER opens in post-WWII Germany when teenager Michael Berg becomes ill and is helped home by Hanna, a stranger twice his age. Michael recovers from scarlet fever and seeks out Hanna to thank her. The two are quickly drawn into a passionate but secretive affair. Michael discovers that Hanna loves being read to and their physical relationship deepens. Hanna is enthralled as Michael reads to her from &amp;quot;The Odyssey,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Huck Finn&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Lady with the Little Dog.&amp;quot; Despite their intense bond, Hanna mysteriously disappears one day and Michael is left confused and heartbroken. Eight years later, while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he is stunned to find Hanna back in his life - this time as a defendant in the courtroom. As Hanna's past is revealed, Michael uncovers a deep secret that will impact both of their lives. THE READER is a story about truth and reconciliation, about how one generation comes to terms with the crimes of another.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I still look like my picture</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244900593000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238855253000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reader</name><id>10113068</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240443000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/10113068/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
