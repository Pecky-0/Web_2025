It's trails are well maintained and there are  maps at the trail head. Parking is along Chebacco Rd. We are actually planning 3 hunts at this location this year. June, August, and October in order to show you what different kinds of mushrooms grow at different times of the season. These dates will pe posted soon on our calandar. In past years we have found many edibles. In fact, last year we found so many chicken mushrooms, that everyone got to take home a bagful of these delictable edibles. Feel free to contact Rick Pierro or Jean Saunders with any questions. Hope to see you there!  &lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>275 Chebacco Rd.
