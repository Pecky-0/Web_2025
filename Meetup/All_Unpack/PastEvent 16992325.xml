&lt;p&gt;Film description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitless &lt;br /&gt;Aspiring author Eddie Morra suffers from chronic writer's block, but his life changes instantly when an old friend introduces him to NZT, a new pharmaceutical that allows him to tap his full potential. With every synapse crackling, Eddie can recall everything he has ever read, seen or heard, learn any language in a day, comprehend complex equations and beguile anyone he meets. Soon Eddie takes Wall Street by storm, parlaying a small stake into millions. But, his accomplishments catch the attention of people willing to do anything to get their hands on his stash of NZT. With his life in jeopardy and the drug's brutal side effects taking their toll, Eddie attempts to hang on to his dwindling supply of NZT long enough to outwit his enemies. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lrm;1hr 45min&amp;lrm;&amp;lrm; - Rated PG-13&amp;lrm;&amp;lrm; - Suspense/Thriller&amp;lrm; &lt;br /&gt;Director: Neil Burger - Cast: Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby at 7:00 p.m. for the 7:30 p.m. show, off to the right as you come in.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandi</member_name><member_id>6039490</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301151695000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Let's meet in the lobby at 7:00 p.m. for the 7:30 p.m. show.
