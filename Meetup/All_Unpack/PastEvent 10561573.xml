They will be having a tour of the tower in ORH... But, it is not very busy there, sooooooooo, how about some of us fly to ORH and do some touch and go's....&lt;br /&gt;They have offered to feed us burgers from their grille... I'm game.. Let's get there by 6:00. While they go into their meeting, we become part of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; Charlie - dinner is 6:30 in front of the ORH terminal. Let me know if you &lt;br /&gt;need a pickup at Swissport. We'll be looking for you guys.&lt;br /&gt;   Dave&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's give em some business and something to look at.. I'll be at FIT around 5:30 (cause I like it there) to get ready for this journey.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We can actually be a lot of help to the guys getting the tour if we get a few planes to show up and fly around. Otherwise it's like a static display over there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hopefully see some of you Wednesday night to help them out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244584188000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243994130000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ORH food and Fly</name><id>10561573</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244066400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/10561573/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
