Are you looking to join a vital conscious living community of new like-minded friends? We meet at The Larches Inn, a magic place in the tradition of majestic Dharmashalas -  “Resting Inns.” The Larches Inn is a four-star historic country manor lovingly restored with stunning grounds, facilities, amenities, food, gardens, and lake. It is a warm spiritual home to all traditions.  We offer events and retreats with guest authors and speakers on topics such as wellness, self-improvement, conscious living, spirituality, diet, health, relationships, finances, small business development, entrepreneurship, life coaching, The Law of Attraction and more. We meet weekly on Monday nights for Meditation all are welcome. Our popular drumming circles, “Drum for Joy” meet once a month around our hearth in winter and outside around our garden fire pit in summer spring and fall. No matter what your passion is you will share heart and soul success practices that will bring you more peace and joy. Our membership is over 200 women who have found friendship, support, healing and information they needed right now to be their best.  Come join us today! We look forward to knowing you. 

Namaste
Heather, Rain, and Sally
