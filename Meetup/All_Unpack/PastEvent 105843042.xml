&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have rescheduled this walk at UCONN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there will be different art exhibits at the Benton. I will list them as soon as I get a flyer.we will visit the Co-op also and then on to lunch. If people want to join us just for lunch that's fine. there is a parking garage next to Gampel Pavilion. Please let me know if you are just doing lunch so we know to look for you.It will also determine where we go for lunch and what time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if you are just coming for lunch and there is someone else in your area also coming for lunch it would be best to carpool the garage does charge for parking. unfortunately there is not a lot of on street parking at UConn anymore, if you are lucky to find it it is usually only for 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will meet at the town hall parking lot off of 4 S.
