Which means we're overdue for another affordable night of Brazilian fare with friendly dining mates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliveira's has fresh food and reasonable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time we dine here the wait staff provide attentive, helpful and prompt service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We'll be joined by members of the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonOnyxbirds/events/86899832/"&gt;Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonOnyxbirds/events/86899832/"&gt;Onyxbirds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Meetup groups as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly recommend their &lt;a href="http://www.oliveirasrestaurant.com/index.html" style="color : #3987cb"&gt;rodizio&lt;/a&gt;, which is an all you can eat meal for less than $17 (does NOT include drinks, dessert, tax nor tip). Servers bring swords of meat to our tables. In addition there is an abundant selection of delicious fare from a self serve buffet bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're more than welcome to order from the &lt;a href="http://www.oliveirasrestaurant.com/our-menu.html" style="color : #3987cb"&gt;a la carte menu&lt;/a&gt; or pay for your meal by weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 7:30 live Brazilian music begins in the main dining room by Anna and Bill of Receita de Samba. They perform wonderful, soft, sweet Bossa Nova, Jazz and Samba which I believe will add to your Brazilian experience. Check out the following link to hear a sample of their music, &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/receitadesamba/music" style="color : #3987cb"&gt;http://www.myspace.com/receitadesamba/music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before I list the Reservation Rules, please understand the NO-SHOW policy was established to ensure everyone who wants to join can and it will be fairly and strictly enforced. I want to assure you I do understand if you've RSVPd YES and on the day of our meal you have a sudden change of plans because you're lost, you don't feel well or you have transportation issues (BUT not if you have a better offer). My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules for Events with &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Reservations&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is less than an hour from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at (617) 445-7549.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring enough &lt;strong&gt;CASH&lt;/strong&gt; to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax. This will help us to settle the bill quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All RSVPs are on a first reply, first seated basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the meal is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will be changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP and if you answered the RSVP question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the meal and you have not attended nor contacted me, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I change your RSVP to NO because you haven't replied to final update meal confirmation email deadline, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW each will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within an hour of the reservation, it is counted as a NO-SHOW if you do not contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email Tonya about rejoining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so please, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya/Meetup reservation or call/text my cell (617) 445 7549</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353240266000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350215838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oliveira's Restaurant - Dinner - Saturday November 17th  7:00 PM</name><id>86899982</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353196800000</time><rsvp_limit>27</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/86899982/</event_url></item>
