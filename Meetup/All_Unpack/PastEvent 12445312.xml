Lots of people aren't that great at pool, but some SoJusters have claimed to have the skills. So show up for lessons, laughs, or just good people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll have a few tables reserved from 6-8PM&lt;/b&gt; for the pool sharks, but plenty of non-billiards hanging out as well. Jillian's has some great appetizers and a full bar which no doubt we'll be taking advantage of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So look no further if you want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while avoiding hitting the 8 ball, are seeking like-minded progressives to play pool with in Boston, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in. If you want to build a strong cross-issue social justice movement, SoJust is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/b&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HEY ORGANIZERS!&lt;/b&gt; If you're involved with a group or project and want to spread the word bring flyers for the free lit table - and there'll be lots of opportunity to schmooze and network!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sorry, this event is 21+ Wheelchair accessible. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; Take the Green line to Kenmore Square, bear left onto Brookline Avenue, take the second left onto Lansdowne Street, at the end of the street make a left onto Ipswich Street - you will see the entrance on the left hand side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to connect outside of SoJust events?&lt;/b&gt; Members can view and post events, job &amp;amp; volunteer announcements, roommate searches, etc. on the 'Message Board' and are encouraged to suggest and co-host events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?&lt;/b&gt;  Check out our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3187615"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt; and learn about our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/pages/Annual_Membership_Fee_details/"&gt;Suggested Annual Membership Fee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow SoJust on Twitter: &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/sojust"&gt;@SoJust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268435279000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264644632000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Billiards for Justice</name><id>12445312</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268262000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/12445312/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/b/global_7503099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
