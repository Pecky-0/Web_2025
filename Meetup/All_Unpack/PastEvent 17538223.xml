I will make corrections if I find out anything has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the finals for the karaoke contest that I had posted on Tues. nights in Jan.  I will be one of the competitors in the finals.  The winner of this evening's competition will get a free trip to California (I think) to compete in a national contest there. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest starts at 5 PM, although the contestants need to arrive by 4. I don't know how easy it will be to save seats for people if they show up after 5 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what time you plan to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be 2 rounds, with each contestant getting to sing a song in each of the 2 rounds. The order of contestants will be random, but will be completely determined before the contest starts. I was told they will produce a schedule that will show approximately when each contestant will sing.  You can come and go during the evening.  I don't know the exact number of contestants, but I think it will be around 30, so this will take a long time.  There will be 3 judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: Rockingham Rd. is Route 28.  From Rt. 93, exit 3, take Rt. 111 eastward. At the intersection with rt. 28, make a right onto rt. 28. Jonathan's is on the left, not far down  I'm posting this event to several meetup groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for the lounge inside the bowling alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year there was time for regular karaoke after the contest finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
