Join us at a large rally in the Strafford Room at the MUB (Memorial Union Building) at the University of NH in Durham. Hear Dr Paul speak and cheer your brains out for our hero! BRING ANY FRIENDS OR FAMILY THAT ARE UNDECIDED. This will be the turning point for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Paul will start speaking at 2:30PM, but please come between 1:45PM and 2PM as parking and accessing the MUB can be a long process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the details on the MUB, click here UNH MUB info and hover over &amp;quot;Building Facilities&amp;quot; for a drop down menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven Rogers is the Students for Ron Paul club leader there and he recommends using C-Lot for parking or if that is full, use A-Lot. If you use A-Lot you may want to wait and catch the Wildcat Transit bus for $1.00. The walk is about a mile I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also gave a stern warning not to be tempted to park in the Durham Marketplace plaza parking lot. They are militant about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many long steep staircases at the MUB. I am not sure which entrance to tell you to use...any one of them will get you there...ask questions and find an elevator if you have any trouble with stairs. MUB phone: 862-2600.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194807143000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194487915000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul Speaking at UNH</name><id>6699006</id><headcount>300</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194633900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/6699006/</event_url></item>
