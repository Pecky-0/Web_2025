We will be seeing Chad Perrone he sings a variety of Folk Rock/Pop/Rock music singles, let's go cheer him on!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to bring your lawn chair or a blanket to sit on.  Also if you want to bring any snacks maybe we can all bring some and have a mini picnic.  If you do just bring something on the light side, easy to eat and share.  Just a thought you don't have to bring anything if you don't want to.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send another update later this week advising an update as to where we will meet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;7/10/09 UPDATE: Hey everyone I hope it's not a problem but I have changed the meetup time for this event, the concert starts at 7:00 so I thought maybe we could get there a little earlier to get a good spot on the beach!  If you are not able to make it at that time please send me an email and I will give you my cell phone # for us to meetup!  Also I have changed the meeting place for this event!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to sitting back and relaxing listening to some tunes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be outside of Salisbury Discount!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247526716000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244027224000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Surfside Live!
