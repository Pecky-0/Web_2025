Basha Cafe is an ideal place for a meetup. It's a lovely restaurant with Middle Eastern food--beautiful decor, good food, and the tables are even already set up perfectly for a meetup! There's also space for dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm scheduling some of the best players and singers of Brazilian music in Boston for Tuesdays, to make the nights a feast for the ears, as well as the appetite! The bands play all different kinds of music with Brazilian roots, so you can expand your knowledge of the music of Brazil at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the deal: we meet at 7:00 for eats/drinks and conversa; music starts around 8. There's NO COVER; you just need to buy something to eat or drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll schedule the meetups each week so we can get a count (and in case we have to skip a week, as we do October 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On October 13 we will listen to the music of Ariane Martins. A native of SÃ£o Paulo, Ariane sings and plays the guitar, accompanied by Jason Davis on bass, Adam Bahrami on cavaquinho, and Gabriel Meireles on percussion. She will be presenting her samba project, exploring the repertoire of the traditional samba, as well as some newer sambas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of free parking around the restaurant; 10-15 minute walk from Alewife T. New Street is behind the Fresh Pond shopping Center, off Concord Ave. Also bus no. 74 from Harvard Square (Bennett Alley stop--near Charles Hotel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Espero que todos venham!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll put a sign on the table, so look for it (and me)!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evelyn</member_name><member_id>4577146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256074968000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254678081000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conversa e Musica at Basha Cafe</name><id>11543901</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255474800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/11543901/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/c/global_1153820.jpeg</photo_url></item>
