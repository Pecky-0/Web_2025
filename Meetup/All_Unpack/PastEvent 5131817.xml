We probably will spend a number of meetings on his works if you would like to influence the books selected or the order in which we read them please come to the meetings and let everyone know your preference. For this first meeting the three organizers selected the Birth of Tragedy. We have ideas for later meetings too, if not on the website then at the end of each meeting we all discuss the plans for the following 1-3 meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a short search for books it looks to me that one of the best edition of Nietzsche's works is a twin pair of books:&lt;br /&gt;Basic Writings of Nietzsche&lt;br /&gt;The Portable Nietzsche&lt;br /&gt;Both of these books are edited by Walter Kaufmann. According to the introduction to the Basic Writings of Nietzsche, all of Nietzsche's work can be read in these two volumes, and overlaps (with few reasonable exceptions) are avoided.&lt;br /&gt;The Birth of Tragedy is the first book of Basic Writings of Nietzsche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are number of resources on the Internet, just google Nietzsche. (One may be able to find even the entire text of the The Birth of Tragedy on the web.) Our usual resources also have articles about Nietzsche:&lt;br /&gt;Standford encyclopedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/contents-unabridged.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://plato.stanford...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/" target="_blank"&gt;http://plato.stanford...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy pages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philosophypages.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.philosophy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/niet.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.philosophy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and see you soon,&lt;br /&gt;Andras&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1160174159000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1158286031000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nietzsche: The Birth of Tragedy</name><id>5131817</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1160001000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5131817/</event_url></item>
