(If RSVP's not rec'd by tomorrow morning at 8:00 A.M. I will cancel this event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing tickets for this performance at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning, pending availiablity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP, with payment.  the cost of the median ticket for decent seats are $58.  I get a $10 discount through my work because we are affiliated with the Wang Theater.  There is a $3 surcharge to purchase online, of course.  (I might be able to save this if I walk over to by the tickets, I will refund you if I do).  To use the payment feature online, I need to charge an $1.50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the total you will need to pay is $52.50 per ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will refund all the money if I can't get the tickets, but I don't think it is going to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show is a 8:00PM at the Wang Theater, Boston.  We can meet in front of the theater at around 7:00-7:30 before the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In front of theater</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>8371260</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250350185000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Women Supporting Women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Women-Social-Network-Group</urlname><id>1379831</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Women Supporting Women Through Life's Incredible Journeys</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245681547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Color Purple </name><id>10706833</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245970800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Women-Social-Network-Group/events/10706833/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/9/global_7285529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
