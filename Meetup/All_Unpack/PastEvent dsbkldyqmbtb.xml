&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;This is a very cool place to explore. I've recently hiked a few of the trails here and would love to explore more of them and share some that I have hiked.This is a free for all hike meaning we will decide together which trails we feel like hiking today. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;I'd like to hike Round Top Trail (which is absolutely beautiful!) to Bearsden Road to where ever we decide next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;There are a combination of gorgeous trails and some old cart roads in Bearsden. These are not paved roads. They are older roads now used as part of the trail system. Part of the Q&amp;amp;A Trail which is not specified on the map, yet is there, is along the Miller's River.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;This hike is a free for all so approximate miles in length and hiking time are not specified here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;This hike is moderate in difficulty with approximate length 5-7 miles yet partially steep climb to Round Top. You must be healthy and somewhat fit to do this hike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;Please bring adequate cold water (most people need at least 16 ounces)and lunch or snacks if you need them too).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;Also prior to the hike (or via email) please privately let me know if you have any medical conditions I should be aware of in case of emergency, ie: asthma, seizures, heart disease, diabetes, allergies, hypo or hyperglycemia, blood pressure problems, etc..., any health conditions that could likely pose a threat to you during a hike and provide me with knowledge of a proper treatment plan in case of emergency. Thank you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : large"&gt;Please be advised that you should protect yourself against the EEE Virus while outdoors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : large"&gt;Please contact me if you need help finding Bearsden or you are running late. 413.559.0192&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : large"&gt;This hike is a dog friendly hike. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearsden Conservation Area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearsden Rd., Athol, MA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miles of forested trails among steep hills, stone walls, &amp;amp; views of the Millers River - beautiful all year round. &lt;br /&gt;

 Description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten miles of trails crisscrossing 1,000 acres of forest, some climbing hills with wonderful views of the Millers River and of mountains near and far; some leading down to the river itself; some, like those that parallel stone walls and traverse a cut through rock ledge, revealing human history - all of this and more await visitors to the premier conservation area of the town of Athol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strenuous climb takes visitors to Round Top, at 1,278 feet Athol’s second highest hill, and to Warren’s Vista, each with panoramic views of the valleys around. Other trails lead to the Newton Reservoir, no longer a water supply but still a lovely pond; to Duck Pond, a haven for waterfowl; to the Ox Bow, a curve in the river and a popular picnic spot; and to a magnificent wetland known as Thousand-Acre Swamp. Visitors can listen to the songs of myriad birds and find evidence of other wildlife that frequents Bearsden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A map board at the parking area outlines the many possibilities for exploration, and a log cabin, built of local hemlock, is available for overnight use. Call Conservation Constable Elwin Bacon (978-249-2004) to reserve the cabin; limited camping is also permitted by prior arrangement with the constable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;Directions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;From downtown Athol, go east on Main St. (Rte. 2A) approx. 1.5 mi. Take left onto Bearsden Rd. Go 1 mi., bear right to stay on Bearsden Rd and continue 0.5 mi. to entrance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #6e1919"&gt;Bearsden Road has a big conservation area sign at the base of it from Main Street(rt 2A) in Athol. It may say Athol Conservation Area as it is referred to by both names. Bearsden Road is located across the street from Larry's Variety Meat and Produce market which is next to the Athol Hospital. There are signs to the hospital from rt 2 at the Athol exits to get you to that vicinity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
