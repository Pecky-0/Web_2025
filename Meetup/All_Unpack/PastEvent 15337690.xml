Let's continue the conversations and meet again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet at 2:30 pm on Saturday, November 20 at Foundry on Elm at 255 Elm Street in Davis Square in Somerville.  According to the hostess, the bar has a full liquor license.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd love to have sent this out as an actual event, but I can't seem to figure out how to do it.  If you know how to create events, and would like to show me how, I would be forever grateful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until than, put this event on your calendar!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsay&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296605749000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288882932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Afternoon Drinks!</name><id>15337690</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290281400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/15337690/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/8/4/global_10197972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
