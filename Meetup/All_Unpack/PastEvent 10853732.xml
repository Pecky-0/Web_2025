If the wheather cooperates, we will be outdoors in our large, fenced-in, play yard. There will be lots to do today! We will have one section for the kiddy pools for those pups who love water. We will have one section with some agility equipment (tunnel, jumps, weave poles, etc). Then we will also have an open area where the dogs can run and play. I hope to see everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I will put out some beverages and some food to munch on. Also, If you would like your dog groomed after them meet up let me know and we can schedule an appointment with 25% off.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252777867000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247335672000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summer Time Party</name><id>10853732</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249750800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/10853732/</event_url></item>
