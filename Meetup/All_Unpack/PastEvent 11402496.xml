GARBA this year...at the Lowell Swaminarayan temple on Saturday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so, people who had been to the Billerica garba last night did not have favorable reviews about it and said that there was hardly any space and the music sucked! And so I decided to change the venue to the Lowell temple. The admission is 5$ and dandiya sticks can be purchased for 4$. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowell will also be easy to commute to.. by the commuter rail. Please let me know those who will need help with transportation asap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets make a nice big group and have amazing time at garba this weekend!!! Also, for those who dont know how to play/dance... its completely fine!!! Garba is thrilling enough just to see or even easy to learn in 5 min!!! I can give 5 minute tutorials if required!!! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amrita</member_name><member_id>9997290</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253579650000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253239986000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>GARBA NIGHT!!!</name><id>11402496</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253406600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/11402496/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
