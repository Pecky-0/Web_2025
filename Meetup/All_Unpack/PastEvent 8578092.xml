This is the group that beat out Four on the Floor to become the WROR's &amp;quot;House Band&amp;quot;....not sure how good they are but we always make our own good time anyway. Meet around 7:30 to help gather tables along the back and grab a bite and some good conversation before the music begins around 9. This evening's organizer is Karen Jackson...please take a look at who's attending and watch for folks, usually gathering at tables along the back wall. Sorry I will not be able to make it but I am sure everyone will have a fun. Please watch for others and introduce yourself, this is a really friendly group, :-) Sandy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223157437000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
