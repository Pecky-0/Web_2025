Unless you’re bringing a degree in computer science or have prior experience delivering software-based products and services, you may well be lost in the jargon of competing software languages, platforms, and general coder-speak that determines how your brilliant idea actually gets created before you can bring it to market. The choices made early on in your application/product development cycle may have huge implications for your business model in the medium and long term, as certain platforms may be great for prototyping, but lousy at scale; other platforms may be the best long term solution, but bring overly expensive developer costs. Is .NET dead? Will Flash/Flex survive? Is Open-source a good or bad option? Should you consider Drupal, WordPress, Ruby on Rails for my web development? Why? If you’re trying to future-proof your application’s viability, how does one do that in a software developer environment of constant technical innovation? Early stage CEOs and founders need to have a grasp of these concepts to be empowered to make smart decisions about the direction of their business, even if it’s just to be able to coordinate with or manage a CTO, CIO, or outsourced development team effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The September 21, 2010 EntreTech Forum will bring together local software developers and the professionals who manage them to distill and provide a lay-person’s view into the jargon-riddled word of software development. The panel discussion will deliver a general overview of the software development process, will provide a perspective on how software developers view the world and what motivates them, and then will dive into specific decision components. As ever, the discussion will be oriented towards a back-and-forth discussion with the audience, to make sure everyone walks away with enhanced understanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moderator: &lt;br /&gt;Andrew Fairbairn – Fairbairn Ventures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panelists: &lt;br /&gt;Scott Fitchet – Figital.com&lt;br /&gt;Invited: Ryder Daniels – Capsaicin LLC&lt;br /&gt;Invited: Jim Sanger – ABS Ventures&lt;br /&gt;Invited: Jon Pierce - Betahouse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGISTER ONLINE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Cost:&lt;br /&gt;$25 public, $10 students&lt;br /&gt;and active military; Promotional Registrations&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter </member_name><member_id>6855667</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285175227000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Technology Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>EntreTechForum</urlname><id>1133540</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The EntreTech Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279142987000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Computing: Coder-Jammed?
