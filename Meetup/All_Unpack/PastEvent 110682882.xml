You can get some more information &amp;amp; details about them here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's essentially the same thing as the TV Show &lt;em&gt;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&lt;/em&gt; Audience members can sit and clap, yell out suggestions when needed, or, for those of us daring enough, can go up and participate in the onstage happenings. Here's some of the things they do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets are (currently) $6 at the door, &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but note that the show on 4/5/12 is FREE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="color : #ffffff"&gt;to celebrate BYOI moving to their new location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If something different gets posted on the website, I will try to update here and/or in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are interested, we may potentially be going out to a local restaurant for dinner prior to the BYOI event (will update in the comments).  I'm open to suggestions, we just want to try to keep in inexpensive to keep our costs down.  Show officially starts at 10:00 pm and generally runs for about 90 minutes or so.  If we meet earlier for dinner, we will meet at approximately 8:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe parking is available next door in the bank (Bank of America?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note: In the past,  BYOI was also BYOB/Food, but there will actually be a bar and small cafe at the new location, so not sure if the BYOB/BYOF is going to continue.  It's best to presume not and we'll check on this particular evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send out my contact info to all those that don't have it the night before or the morning of the event.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nidal</member_name><member_id>8949503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365222984000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun Folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Games-Events</urlname><id>1435824</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Games &amp; Events Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364060099000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BYOI: Bring Your Own Improv!
