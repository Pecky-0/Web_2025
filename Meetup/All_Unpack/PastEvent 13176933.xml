At the same time, due to the economy, competition from casinos, and other factors, a number of tracks in other states have also closed for good.  This has led to a dramatic increase in the number of retired racing greyhounds looking for forever homes and has put a strain on greyhound adoption groups around the country.  As a result, now, more than ever, those groups need support. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So join me on April 28, at &lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Johnny D's&lt;/a&gt; Benefit for &lt;a href="http://www.greyhound.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Greyhound Friends, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a local, non-profit greyhound adoption group based in Hopkinton, MA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irish greyhounds and their friends will be greeting patrons at the entrance, and there will be performances of Celtic music by such musicians as Larry Reynolds and Brendan Bulger.  Cover charge is $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272671736000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271212608000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gone to the Dogs - A Benefit for Greyhound Friends</name><id>13176933</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272498300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/13176933/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/6/global_14366790.jpeg</photo_url></item>
