I've secured a place we can camp at Friday night (my dad's girlfriend's house in Fryeburg).  I've reserved some canoes for us as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing:&lt;br /&gt;$45 per canoe per day ($45 per person for the weekend - 2 people per canoe) and $14 transportation fee for the canoes ($7 per person) for a total of $52 per person.  I need a $15 deposit from everyone to hold the canoes.  I will hold the canoes until the end of the day on August 6th.  If I haven't received a deposit from anyone I'll need to release the canoe(s) as that's the cutoff for a refund.  Also, parking at Swans Falls is $8 so we can make a plan regarding parking before we head up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplies (What we'll need - please use the poll to list anything you're bringing so we don't have too much of any one item):&lt;br /&gt;Tents (I have one, but we'll need more than that)&lt;br /&gt;Firewood&lt;br /&gt;Coolers (I have one, but we'll need more than that)&lt;br /&gt;Food (burgers/dogs/chicken/snacks/fruit etc)&lt;br /&gt;Beverages (water/alcholic/non alcoholic)&lt;br /&gt;Toys (both beach and water)&lt;br /&gt;Bug spray&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping bags (if you don't have one let me know)&lt;br /&gt;Grill (I have this)&lt;br /&gt;Toilet Paper&lt;br /&gt;Condiments&lt;br /&gt;Paper plates&lt;br /&gt;Plastic Utensils&lt;br /&gt;Music (I have this)&lt;br /&gt;Garbage bags (I have these)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm planning on taking the 14th off and heading up early.  If anyone is interested in doing the same, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll keep updating this every few days so please check back periodically so we can stay on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat and Dog&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1250532242000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248713337000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canoe Trip - Saco River (Maine)</name><id>10968286</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250290800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/10968286/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/1/global_9899345.jpeg</photo_url></item>
