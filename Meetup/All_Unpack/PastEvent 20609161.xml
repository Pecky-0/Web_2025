&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come explore the narrow streets, alleys, and cul-de-sacs of Beacon Hill's less prestigious North Slope community. Here you'll see 200-year-old wooden dwellings built for Boston's early African-American community, not far from the residences of wealthy white progressives who also aided the anti-slavery movement. On nearby streets are the homes of 19th-century carpenters and craftsmen, and tenement apartments erected by Jewish immigrants in the first decades of the 20th century. We'll view the African Meeting House; two documented stops on the Underground Railroad; Boston's oldest surviving synagogue; a gambling parlor; and a maze of pedestrian passageways with unusual architectural features. The tour lasts about two hours. In case of extreme weather, call the Cambridge Center at 617-547-6789 for information and rain date. Limited to 20.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sec. 01: 1 Tuesday, 6:00-8:00 pm.
