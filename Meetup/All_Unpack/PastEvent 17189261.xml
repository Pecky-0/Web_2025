&lt;p&gt;WUMB is holding their annual music Fest at the UMass Boston Campus from 12 noon - 7:00pm on Sunday, June 5.   "It's a world class Music Festival in your own backyard - and, on the waterfront! What's your pleasure? Is it singer-songwriters, cajun or Americana music? Do you like to celebrate tradition or to discover new, up-and-coming artists? Or, music from Nova Scotia? The breadth of music at this year's WUMB Music Fest is again as rich as it is diverse. You don't have to be a connoisseur to enjoy our music festival - but it helps to have a love for all different forms of music. And if the first thirteen years are any indication, you'll experience it all at our 14th Annual Music Fest. We've got three stages and more for you to choose from. So, whether you prefer to sit outside under a tent (new this year) stretch out a blanket or sit in an auditorium or our big coffeehouse setting, you'll be hearing some of the best music around. It's the biggest festival of its kind in the Boston area, and the greatest place to be if you like live music. Overall, it the best music from quality talent, the finest food and craft vendors from the New England area, and a fun, friendly atmosphere for the entire family."&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307295029000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>It's a great Festival with a huge variety of music!</why><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302005975000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WUMB Music Fest!</name><id>17189261</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307289600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/17189261/</event_url></item>
