If you've been coming to some of the meetups and now would like to learn how to belay, then this is the class to take.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the class description:  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;On Belay!&amp;quot; Introduction to Rock Climbing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;On Belay!&amp;quot; is our most popular class! Perfect for anyone new to the vertical world, this hands-on course will teach you everything you need to know to safely climb in our gym! You’ll learn to belay, tie the knots, use climbing equipment, and climb to the top…all with an emphasis on safety. Gear rental and full day pass are included! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This class normally cost $55 / per person, however by signing up with meetup for this event the cost will only be $35.  This includes the class, all the gear for the evening, as well as a two week membership to the gym.   It's a super super good deal.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make this one, then no worries I'm planning on doing one at least twice a month throughout the winter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few conditions:&lt;br /&gt;1.  You must be a member of meetup to RSVP - if you have a friend that wants to come to this, they cannot simply come - they must RSVP through meetup.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I am requiring a $5 deposit for this event (which is fully refundable) just to ensure that the people who actually sign up, come.  &lt;br /&gt;3.  You cannot RSVP Yes without paying the deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, please let me know if you have any questions!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Front Desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Jeanette</member_name><member_id>8934370</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288276851000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctrockclimbing</urlname><id>1388805</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>CT Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287071941000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Introductory BELAY Class</name><id>15108648</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288218600000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ctrockclimbing/events/15108648/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/5/global_7662965.jpeg</photo_url></item>
