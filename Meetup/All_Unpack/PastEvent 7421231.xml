It is voted the best place for karaoke by the Valley Advocate.  The weekends are the busiest with about 150 people crowding the small bar.  So early arrival around 10:00 to 10:30p.m. is suggested if you want to get a chance to strut your stuff and sing away into the evening.  No food is served at the bar, but think of it this way if you drink too much you can always stay at the motel that Mingles is linked to.  Mingles is a fun, casual, and a down to earth atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one who is too chicken to sing (haven't sang since High School)
