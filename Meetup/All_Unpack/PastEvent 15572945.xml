They combine much of what New Haven pizza is and throw in some delicious flair of it's own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specials: I've been told it will be:  &lt;br /&gt;$1 off the &amp;quot;Cicchetti&amp;quot; (snacks) part of the Food Menu.  &lt;br /&gt;$3 Draught Beer  &lt;br /&gt;$5 Glasses of Wine &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to give the proprietors an accurate estimate of how many people to expect (so that they can provide enough bartenders, etc.), if you think you're going to go then please RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (A.J.) will serve as the contact for this evening. You can try my Cell at 315-345-9348.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.
