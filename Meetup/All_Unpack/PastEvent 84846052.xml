<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The wind's supposed to be good and the weather's supposed to be warmish (low 70s) so I'm looking for someone to crew for me on a 420 out of Community Boating sometime after 1 PM. I'm flexible on times -- of course, the wind will determine the best times -- but the requirements are somewhat restrictive: You must &lt;br /&gt;

-- be &amp;lt;= 130 lbs. &lt;br /&gt;

-- have a wetsuit &lt;br /&gt;

-- be somewhat experienced in handling a jib on a performance boat in medium to high winds. &lt;br /&gt;

-- be somewhat intrepid: Not afraid to get dunked (though I very rarely capsize; it's still a possibility) or to go fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349125898000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349046623000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crew on a 420 in the Basin</name><id>84846052</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349114400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/84846052/</event_url></item>
