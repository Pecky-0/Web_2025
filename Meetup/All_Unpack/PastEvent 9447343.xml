The last general meeting of New England United was in early November, and to date NEU has not endorsed either the March 21 action in DC called by the National Assembly and other coalitions, networks and organizations, or the April 4 action in NYC called by UFPJ at its recent conference in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you will join us on Saturday to help us plan for what is destined to be a banner year for the peace movement in New England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proposed agenda from the Regional committee:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:00 - 1:05 Introductions and welcome&lt;br /&gt;1:05 - 1:45 Political forum: Crisis in Gaza (presenter/facilitator:  Ashley Smith)&lt;br /&gt;1:45 - 2:00 Reports/discussion:  Recent UFPJ conference in Chicago&lt;br /&gt;2:00 - 2:15 Reports/discussion:  Majoritarian working group&lt;br /&gt;2:15 - 2:30 Reports/discussion:  Conference committee&lt;br /&gt;2:30 - 2:45 Break&lt;br /&gt;2:45 - 3:45 Discussion: Calls for national action on March 21 and April 4&lt;br /&gt;3:45 - 4:00 Announcements, next meeting&lt;br /&gt;4:00 - 5:00 Sub-regional meetings&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Schaich</member_name><member_id>4406518</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Andrews</member_name><member_id>5009779</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Harris</member_name><member_id>5188497</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suren Moodliar</member_name><member_id>5714882</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232813424000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People for Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>stopthewars</urlname><id>708558</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Antiwar</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231140455000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New England United regional antiwar coalition general meeting</name><id>9447343</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232215200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/stopthewars/events/9447343/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/global_2184137.jpeg</photo_url></item>
