&lt;p&gt;=========================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you who would like to get out and hike without going too far, I am scheduling a hike closer to home (my home). It's appealing because you don't have to drive far to get a quick hike in. Mount Watatic is a 1,831 ft / 558 m mountain peak near Ashburnham, Massachusetts. Based on peakery data, it ranks as the 106th highest mountain in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we'll be doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This loop trail covers almost six miles round trip. The first half is perhaps the most interesting, with large boulders, steep slopes, and an excellent set of views. The second half offers some strange trees on undulating ridge terrain, good views from neighboring Nutting Hill and then dives into the forest again. Crossing to the Midstate Trail, the sights become more common and the trail is simply a forest trail with no outlooks. We will hike to the summit and then go further on the Mid-state trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at the parking lot off Rt. 119 in Ashburnham, MA. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Rte+119,+Ashburnham,+MA&amp;amp;hnear=Massachusetts+119,+Ashburnham,+Worcester,+Massachusetts+01430&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=14"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for directions to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is will be at a faster moderate paced hike so this is not a beginner hike. The goal is to get some cardiovascular exercise and make this easy hike more challenging. You should be fairly active in shape to sign up for this event. I did this in less than 2 hours and would like to keep that pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
