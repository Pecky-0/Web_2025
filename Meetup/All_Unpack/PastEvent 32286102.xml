At every turn in his career, he's done his own thing, whether that meant touring with jam bands, playing Rock venues or recording with Bluegrass all-stars on platinum Country albums. Now Dierks steps forward with his most artistically daring project yet, the all-acoustic Up On The Ridge - a powerful, beautiful album steeped in the Bluegrass and roots music that moved Dierks Bentley to be a Country musician in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show starts at 8, but it's a Saturday night and it's going to&amp;nbsp;be a full house. Dierks usually doesn't do free shows and he plays bigger venues, so a small venue and for free, you know it'll fill up quickly. We can make carpool plans, but let's plan to make it to the casino no later than 6:30-7.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319476822000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315207836000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE CONCERT - Dierks Bentley at the Wolf Den</name><id>32286102</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319310000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/32286102/</event_url></item>
