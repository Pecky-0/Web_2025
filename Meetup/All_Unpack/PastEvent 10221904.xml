I set the meetup time for 5:15, because you'll want to get there early. The class fills up fast. That will give you enough time to sign in, pay, and change before class begins! Check out their website below for more details. (You'll probably want to bring water as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.portlandpoweryoga.com" target="_blank"&gt;Portland Power Yoga Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll wait in the lobby until 5:20. After that, I'll be in the yoga room. You'll be able to find me because I will be wearing a black tank top that reads &amp;quot;You can't afford me&amp;quot;. I figured I'd wear something silly that's easy to find!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a black tank top that says "You can't afford me."
