 Though we are 64.5 years in independence today, we are way behind in giving independence for many Indians who have never benefited from policies and development of India. In fact, Times of India editorial states that Corruption and Inflation are two reasons, India's growth story may not even materialize. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Our goals for this event are: &lt;br /&gt;

 -to raise awareness of social and economic change in India and United States, &lt;br /&gt;

 -to promote greater participation in international dialogue and exchange and, by doing so, &lt;br /&gt;

 -to strengthen the social and economic change movement locally, nationally and internationally. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 'Your support for this event will contribute directly to awareness of social and economic change'. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 It is our opportunity to learn and support India Against Corruption movement. &lt;br /&gt;
