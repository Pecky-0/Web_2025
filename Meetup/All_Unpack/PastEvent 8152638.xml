This part of town is Somersville.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driveway access is on the left in 0.3 miles right before the bridge/dam, park anywhere near the water or tree, picnick bench, area if its not used yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be driving a blue Toyota Avalon towing my kayak trailer with the orange traffic cones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the event of rain, the event gets canceled..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is most likely the northern most area for paddling i will list, the rest will be more southern and a few more Farmington river trips near Strawberry Park..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday: A chance of showers and thunderstorms before 11am, then a slight chance of showers. Mostly cloudy, then gradually becoming sunny, with a high near 80. West wind between 6 and 11 mph. Chance of precipitation is 30%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday Night: Mostly clear, with a low around 55. West wind between 3 and 7 mph. &lt;br /&gt;Ok i really dont know what it will be like tomorrow at this time..but check the weather..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks ok so far, but ya never know?LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ 10.00 doughnation per kayak rented.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for my Blue toyota Avalon and Kayak trailer</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AL-r</member_name><member_id>2711041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214762907000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213635213000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Somersville Mill Pond Evening Kayaking Trip and Barbie Q</name><id>8152638</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213740900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/8152638/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/6/global_3541542.jpeg</photo_url></item>
