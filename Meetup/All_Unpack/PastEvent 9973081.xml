We have agreed to assist with the children's area. This is the official summary that I most recently received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Children's area - we do have an easy up and all the materials you'll need to keep the&lt;br /&gt;kids entertained all day. I'm definitely up for new ideas as well - it's been make a&lt;br /&gt;wand, make a mask, plant a magical garden for the past couple of years. Plus we do a&lt;br /&gt;coloring contest...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's start discussing this, who can help with what, etc. we can finalize plans before our next class on the 6th. I have done face-painting on 3 different occasions and I'm sure the multitude of talented artist we have can do even better. Also in previous years we would have story telling at regular posted intervals. All my pagan-centric children's books are packed away but if someone else can provide some?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it has been asked if we could do a &amp;quot;Pagan Parenting&amp;quot; workshop, 20-30 minutes max. While I have developed &amp;amp; delivered curriculum before, there are many other well-qualified members of our group, so I throw open the topic and invite discussion and volunteers. The only caveat on this is that we have to have an outline and bio on the person(s) giving it by Aug 29th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the event is (only) a month away we need to finilize our plans and backups ASAP, so write on or off list with the area you would be interested in helping with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her service,&lt;br /&gt;Leoric&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256050792000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237305784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>EM PPD</name><id>9973081</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253455200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9973081/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/0/global_10293296.jpeg</photo_url></item>
