Colling's Foundation in Stow, MA. This is a private museum that is
only open to the public 3 times a year! Take advantage of seeing
antique autos from the glory days of automobiles...all in pristine
condition. These are works of art. Picture yourself in a "rumble
seat" or marvel at the ladies fashions that accompany the
roadsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on display are Bob Colling's WWII aircraft. Plane rides are
available by contacting the Colling's Foundation ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to meet at 2:30, marvel at the museum, and
(optionally) regather at 5:00 and travel a short distance to Stow's
other airport (Minuteman Airfield) and dine at Nancy's Airfield
Cafe at 5:30. RSVPS are required by June 15th if you plan to
dine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>www.collingsfoundation.org</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>4094202</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308780791000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Active "People" people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1425</urlname><id>1283834</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Sitzundjibers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307321413000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate Father's Day (a day early) at a unique Private Museum</name><id>21100271</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308421800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1425/events/21100271/</event_url></item>
