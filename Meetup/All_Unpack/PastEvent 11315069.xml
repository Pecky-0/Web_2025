Nonetheless, we suggest you still gather at Ivy Restaurant for social time!  The reservation is under Boston Book Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're meeting from 6:30pm to 8:00pm on Wednesday, September 9th at the Ivy Restaurant (www.ivyrestaurantgroup.com) in the basement bar. The Ivy is on Temple Place, right near the Silver Line stop, and around the corner from Downtown Crossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning on sharing the results at the event, but since I won't be there, here's the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Survey Results: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Frequency: 1x per month&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Days: Weekdays (prefer Tues / Wed) 6:30-8:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Location: Cafes and Coffee Shops in different parts of Boston&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Activities: Wine 'n' Cheese, Dining Out, Guest Speakers&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Cost: &amp;lt;$20&lt;br /&gt;Genres: Autobiography, Historical Fiction and Non-Fiction, Short Stories, Biographies, Philosophical Novels&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Erin</member_name><member_id>4684283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253463209000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252380056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Downtown Boston Book Club Social Event</name><id>11315069</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252535400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/11315069/</event_url></item>
