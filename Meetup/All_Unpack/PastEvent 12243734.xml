Maybe you've heard of them...  &lt;a href="http://www.taptapas.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.taptapas.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.taptapas.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They've built some great looking apps --&amp;gt;  I'm personally fond of their sense of humor, as evidenced in their &lt;a href="http://www.taptapas.com/about_and_contact.php" target="_blank"&gt;history blurb&lt;/a&gt; and in their &lt;a href="http://www.taptapas.com/art_slides.php" target="_blank"&gt;Art Slides&lt;/a&gt; app).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael has offered to share some thoughts on the business / marketing end of things and tell us about his company, which happens to be looking for talent right now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;namely: &lt;br /&gt;an Objective C programer(s) - full time&lt;br /&gt;a Web designer - freelance/ part time / full time&lt;br /&gt;a PHP developer - freelance / part time  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael encourages anyone interested in working with Tap Tapas to bring a resume/salary requirements along. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - - - - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that presentation/conversation, which I think might last at least 90 minutes, might anyone else have an urge to share something technical you've grasped?  Or maybe a specific technical issue for which you could use some help?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If so: please let me know in advance, if possible. &lt;br /&gt;Hopefully: the Tap Tapas folks will serve up some yummy finger food in line with their yummy name and tagline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;either way: I hope you can make it.&lt;br /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Reeves</member_name><member_id>4215226</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael DeSouza</member_name><member_id>11134545</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263841834000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>interested parties</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-iPhone-Developers-Network</urlname><id>1454525</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine iOS Developer Network  (iPhone/iPad)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262812442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let us meet at Tap Tapas</name><id>12243734</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263668400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-iPhone-Developers-Network/events/12243734/</event_url></item>
