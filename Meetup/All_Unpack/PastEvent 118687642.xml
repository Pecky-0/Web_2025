Although the healing process is well underway, we are still seeing signs of mental and emotional injury: trouble sleeping, fear, lack of trust, and anxiety. These symptoms can become the lasting stains of terrorism. In times like these, the call to reestablish belonging, connection and alleviate anxiety and other stress is critical to moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we are hosting the ‘Breath Water Sound’ workshop, a community recovery program, and bringing it to communities in Greater Boston. It has been administered internationally, and has provided relief to thousands after disasters including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and the Haiti earthquake of 2010. We had our first workshop in Watertown last week, and are having another starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through relaxing meditation and other processes, it teaches simple and effective techniques to defuse the fear that can linger after life threatening danger. The techniques help to shift attention away from reliving the past towards future possibilities. While talking about the events is not a focus of the program, sharing experiences and giving one another support enables participants to form new bonds, a sense of belonging, and feelings of resilience. Benefits of the program include better sleep, increased energy, and greater focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mon - Wed 6:30 - 8 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sessions required as we will build on what we learn each day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Richa Bhatnagar</member_name><member_id>12435992</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368706496000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonmeditates</urlname><id>1257412</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>"Boston Meditates" Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1368157657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community Recovery Program: Breath Water Sound</name><id>118687642</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>178200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368484200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonmeditates/events/118687642/</event_url></item>
