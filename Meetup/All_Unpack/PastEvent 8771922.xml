Then Ann is planning on guiding you through a meditation to help you connect to your Source Energy/Spirit.  Feeling connected to your Source Energy promotes feelings of well-being; and feelings of well-being allow you to attract what you desire and deliberately create!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a process, we'll talk about and practice &amp;quot;Changing Your Story&amp;quot; - from explanations and stories about what you &lt;u&gt;don't&lt;/u&gt; like in your past or present, to what you &lt;u&gt;want&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, we'll also spend time on group support and coaching on questions and issues you want to bring to our meeting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to be and create with you all!  Please RSVP asap, and also PLEASE invite others to join you!  &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; your plans change after RSVP'ing, please be considerate enough to e-mail us so we won't be unnecessarily be waiting for you to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With appreciation and joy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be upstairs.
