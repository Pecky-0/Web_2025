Despite the Thanksgiving holiday, we will still be playing this Saturday @ 2PM @ Cambridge Common. Our very own TURKEY BOWL!!! Bring a friend. It doesn't matter how good or bad you are. We are trying to have fun playing flag football and getting some exercise at the same time. We hope to see you Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Flag Footballers&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196103863000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195522933000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag Football - 2PM - Cambridge Common</name><id>6773147</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195930800000</time><rsvp_limit>26</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6773147/</event_url></item>
