We start over at the coolige corner starbucks and walk to cleveland circle and around the reservoir (which is 2 miles round).  Perhaps if we feel like it (and the weather is agreeable) we can walk around the reservoir twice.  Last time the trip took us about an hour and 45 minutes in freezing rain.  The change in weather will be most welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the coolige corner starbuck on Harvard Ave.  There is plenty of free parking on both Beacon St and municpal Brookline parking lots in the area.  Brookline Meters are free after 6.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178854218000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177526062000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cleveland Circle Reservoir Walk</name><id>5708474</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178146800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5708474/</event_url></item>
