Here's the chance to have dedicated time for a small group to focus on your project or idea and pay it forward at the same time. Everyone will have approximately 15-20 minutes. (If it’s a large group we will break up into smaller groups)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas about how you might use the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Brainstorm new marketing ideas or get feedback on your marketing materials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Get feedback about a rough idea or concept that you have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Practice your "pitch"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Ask for help with a problem or issue you are having&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Have the group help define "next steps" for you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The possibilities are endless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a free meetup. It will run from 7pm to 9pm. This event will include three meetup groups: Entrepreneur Allies, Nonprofit Connector (soon to be Nonprofit Allies) and Entrepreneurship for a Sustainable Planet (soon to be Green Business Allies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*We had a great time last time! I've had the pleasure of hosting this event several times and every time magic happens. It doesnt matter if its a small group or large....Its fun and helpful in both expected and unexpected ways. Hope you can join us! Trish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
