According to the survey, Boston Commons was the most popular starting point, and 6:30 &amp;amp; 7pm were the best times.  I can get there around 6:45, so I'm going to start it at that.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;PLEASE BE ON TIME, Call or Text me, or update your rsvp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  This helps me more than you could ever imagine!  It's like using your turn signal - using it is a huge help to those around you, even though it doesn't really help you that much, until someone runs into you because they didn't know you were turning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The walk length was tied 2 &amp;amp; 3 miles, so I made a 2.5 mile walk, that can be extended if there's interest.  &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=117398343489237033278.00048ae9007fee6e1d90c&amp;amp;ll=42.345572,-71.066651&amp;amp;spn=0.014908,0.031028&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;Here's the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mid point of this walk is &lt;a href="http://flourbakery.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Flour Bakery &amp;amp; Cafe&lt;/a&gt;.   Totally awesome bakery I still haven't managed to visit yet.  They are open until 9pm during the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also going to post this on the two dinner meetups since Flour is such an awesome place.  If you are on the other groups, please only rsvp to one of the events.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send my mobile # to the RSVPs &amp; check my profile pic.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279151691000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278634524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A visit to Flour!
