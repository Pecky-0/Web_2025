&lt;p&gt;Kristina Sherk of SharkPixel.com has worked in high-end photo retouching for over nine years. With a background in photography, she’s highly sought after for her realistic retouching technique and respect for maintaining her clients’ photographic style. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Your biggest portrait jobs might require a professional like Kristina, but your more “everyday” shoots can still benefit from some simple editing and retouching in Photoshop. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

In this live webinar on Tuesday, April 9th at 4pm ET, Kristina will do a live demo in Photoshop. She’ll go through a sequence of commands and operations that she typically uses on a headshot, and show us how to record them as a Photoshop quick action. Kristina will also make the action available for downloading after the webinar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also please keep in mind that sadly our webinar tool caps the number of people that can attend. So make sure to grab a spot before they're gone by following these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click this link to go register for the webinar. If we’re already full, you’ll see a page that says so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re one of the first 1,000 you'll get an email with instructions on how to connect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in 15-20 minutes before we start at 4pm ET on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically everyone rushes in at 4pm ET, and that's when people start getting locked out. By showing up 10-15 minutes early, you should be safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's online.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365549059000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365193517000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Online Webinar: Retouching Portrait Photography With Photoshop Quick Actions</name><id>112892662</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365537600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/112892662/</event_url></item>
