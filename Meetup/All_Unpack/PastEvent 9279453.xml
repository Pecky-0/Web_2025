Enjoy the passion, energized feeling, and love of dancing. Have a lot of fun! &lt;br /&gt;2. Develop new valued friendships with both men and women. &lt;br /&gt;3. Develop a fulfilling long-term monogamous relationship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Values: &lt;br /&gt;1. We believe that a long-term, fulfilling relationship is built on some fundamental values: Integrity, Honesty, Respect, Loyalty, Reliability, and Non-judgment in our communication with each other. We value each other’s opinion. We listen! &lt;br /&gt;2. We strive to be positive, optimistic, kind, giving professionals. How? We don’t criticize, condemn or complain. &lt;br /&gt;3. We value diversity in religions, nationalities, and ethnic backgrounds. We cooperate as a team to be successful by inviting other professional people we know. &lt;br /&gt;4. We demonstrate this respectful/ nonjudgmental mindset in two ways: &lt;br /&gt;A. By saying Yes to someone who asks us to dance. (once) &lt;br /&gt;B. By offering positive solutions or alternatives if you disagree with something. (Please don’t criticize, condemn or complain) We welcome suggestions to improve the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invite other friends, particularly men.  My personal goal is to have an equal amount of men and women.  Unique! We usually have  equal numbers of men and women.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The synergistic efforts of everyone will make it truly a memorable dance party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The cost is $12.00 plus wine or food assignment listed below.&lt;br /&gt;Of course if you are unable to bring anything, then your entry fee will be $30.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer/Host - Richard Tosti&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Format:&lt;br /&gt;Location is in a warm, loving and relaxing environment.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Dress code - &amp;quot;business casual&amp;quot; – NO JEANS OR SNEAKERS&lt;br /&gt;7:30pm - 11:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, Jan. 17, 2009&lt;br /&gt;Temple Shalom Emeth, 16 Lexington Street, Burlington, MA&lt;br /&gt;Maximum attendees 170&lt;br /&gt;Dancing will be available - DJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffet which will start at 8:00&lt;br /&gt;Open Bar - wine/beer that you are assigned to bring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your last name begins with the following letter please bring the following.&lt;br /&gt;Per person-Please Label the dish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disposable containers please&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-C Dessert &lt;br /&gt;D-F 2 bottles soda (1 diet &amp;amp; 1 regular) and 2 gallons of water &lt;br /&gt;G-I tossed green salad vegetable tray with dip (make sure to include dressing) &lt;br /&gt;J-Q Favorite casserole dish– No meat! only suggestions - vegetable pot pie &lt;br /&gt;pasta with broccoli and other vegetables &lt;br /&gt;vegetable and cheese calzone &lt;br /&gt;red sauce with pasta and cheese &lt;br /&gt;cheese pizza &lt;br /&gt;baked ziti, macaroni and cheese / baked stuffed shells / linguine with sauce and of course cheese/lasagna,/ vegetable lasagna / cheese calzones / &lt;br /&gt;R-Z wine or beer- &lt;br /&gt;Coffee and tea served &lt;br /&gt;Please no chips or crackers &lt;br /&gt;No Shellfish or pork products &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO MEAT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;170 guests only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location and Directions&lt;br /&gt;Temple Shalom Emeth, 16 Lexington Street, Burlington, MA &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;128 North&lt;br /&gt;Exit 32B Middlesex Turnpike (Burlington/Arlington)&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the ramp turn right onto Middlesex Turnpike - on the left is Barnes/Noble&lt;br /&gt;After the Burlington Mall turn right on to Burlington Mall Rd. - on left is Longs Jewelers&lt;br /&gt;Take left after you pass Kohl’s on your left which is Lexington Street&lt;br /&gt;Temple Shalom Emeth is on your left at16 Lexington Street, Burlington, MA &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two parking lots on the right side of building.
