Talk a bit about who we are, what we do and why we came.&lt;br /&gt;After that, we'll just discuss whatever we'd like. Maybe share what JavaScript projects we are working on, or talk about what ambitious JavaScript ideas we have in mind.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tavern in the Square in CENTRAL Square.
