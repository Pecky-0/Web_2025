For those who attended, you can attest to the dense content of Integral Calculus, as well as the exciting new developments from Ken.  Come hang out, eat some good food, and enjoy the &amp;quot;We&amp;quot; space!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**a note about food- please keep in mind that many are vegetarians when planning to bring an item.  Samadhi will provide drinks and paper goods including utensils.
