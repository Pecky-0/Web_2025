This time we will be checking out Cantina Italiana restaurant on Hanover Street. This restaurant got very good reviews on Yelp and has a reasonably priced menu. Each member pays for his/her own food/drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we will head over to the nearby lounge the Living Room for drinks. These are popular events! We look forward to seeing you for another fun night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Please only sign up if you can definitely attend. Please do NOT sign up just to hold your spot without actually knowing if you can attend. These are very popular events and there will be an extensive waiting list. If your plans change, please update your RSVP as soon as possible, so we can make space for someone who would like to go. Thank you for your help!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo)  near hostess stand or at our table.
