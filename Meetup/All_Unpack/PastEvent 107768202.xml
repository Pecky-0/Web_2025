A sold-out success at last year’s Boston Palestine Film Festival, this story of forbidden love is the first fiction feature set in Gaza in 15 years. After two Palestinian college students are forced to return home to Gaza, their families try everything to keep them apart—while the students do everything they can to stay connected. “It’s superbly acted . . . the end will leave you breathless and wondering” (The Huffington Post). Winner of Best Film and Best Actress at the 2011 Dubai International Film Festival. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy your tickets at the door, but I recommend getting them ahead of time. Last time, the movie was sold out! Let's meet at 7:45 outside of the Alfond Auditorium on the G level of the museum. &lt;br /&gt;
