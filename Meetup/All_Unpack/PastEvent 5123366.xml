We'll pick back up with the study guide to &amp;quot;Objectivism - the Philosophy of Ayn Rand,&amp;quot; and for those of you who don't have a study guide (it's not so easy to get), I'll have copies.  We'll pick up in Chapter 1 where we left off back in August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry if you don't have a big knowledge of Objectivism or Ayn Rand's works - - that's what we're trying to learn.  However, a familiarity with some of her writings - especially Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead - - would make it more meaningful and relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will hope to see you THIS SUNDAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pay meetup.com $19.00 per month to use their site, but for me, this is a small price to pay for the opportunity to meet other people interested in Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand.  However, if anyone would be willing to donate a dollar or two to help me defray the monthly expenditure, that would be great.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1160046189000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1157925649000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand October Meetup</name><id>5123366</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1159736400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/5123366/</event_url></item>
