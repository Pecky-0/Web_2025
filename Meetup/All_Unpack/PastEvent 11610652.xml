That’s right, the one day mini roleplaying convention that focuses on small-press, independently published story oriented games. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of Fellowship members will be making the scene out in Greenfield. I've not been myself, but I'm led to understand that it's a chance to not only play some of those crazy story games you've been hearing about but in many cases meeting and playing with the designers. So in a couple of years, when some new indie game has taken the world by storm, you can say, &amp;quot;Oh, yeah. I totally played that game during the beta testing. Gave 'em a few pointers. You know, just to polish it a bit.&amp;quot; Then just sit back and absorb the waves of envy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a day long event with two gaming sessions. Take a peek at the &lt;a href="http://www.jiffycon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jiffycon website&lt;/a&gt; for authorative information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign up here to tell us you’re planning to be there, but you’ll need to register over at Jiffycon as well.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tewhill</member_name><member_id>3431516</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chuck Henebry</member_name><member_id>5668194</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259950406000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255380597000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>JiffyCon - Fall '09</name><id>11610652</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258207200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/11610652/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/global_3081279.jpeg</photo_url></item>
