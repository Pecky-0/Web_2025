The quality of this group is astounding -- and it just gets better.  Newbies, all of your contributions and questions are welcomed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month we will conduct a Design-Review session where one of our members presents a project they are working on. We will then explore 3 challenges presented by the project and asks for your thoughts and comments. The idea is that as a group we will explore the impact of design choices made during Python development -- while identifying the strengths and weaknesses of other options. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month we will focus on a gaming project called Mekanimo with Python Meet-up member Fahri  Basegmez.  Mekanimo uses Python and wxPython to create the gaming engine (middleware) and development environment that controls visual elements -- including a real world physics engine!  But I'll quote Fahri below to explain more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mekanimo's project goals include, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Introducing science and technology to people, especially young ones, in a fun environment.  It aims to be a powerful and entertaining learning environment for topics as diverse as introduction to computer programming, physics, feedback systems, robotics, mechanical linkages and mechanisms, etc.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to combination of smart objects, real time sound synthesis, programmability and provided libraries this tool can also be used to create games, puzzles, mechanical simulations, and multimedia presentations.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it seems to be everybody's favorite subject I will be focusing on the game creation and introduction to programming aspects of the application during my introduction instead of more technical issues like mechanical simulations and robotics. &amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The 3 technical aspects we will review are: &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;1 - Naming conventions: Not getting the in the developers way when building a development tool with Python and wxPython. &lt;br /&gt;At first glance this seems like a trivial problem but it is a big issue because of the underlying layers of Mekanimo and wxPython.  Considering that this application will be programmed by its users, a consistent naming convention is a must.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;2 - Smart objects: Event-Driven Programming with Python and wxPython.  &lt;br /&gt;These are Mekanimo objects with user defined behaviors.  wxPython already has a mechanism to bind events to objects.  How do we mix Mekanimo objects with wxPython objects seamlessly?  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;3 -  User interface and application layout details.   &lt;br /&gt;We all know this is a killer.  Looking at the same interface for a long time it is easy to miss sharp corners.  So we'll provide fresh eyes for Fahri and an outsiders' perspective to spot the obvious problems.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll try our best to get through all of these in one session, but if we go deep in one or another that would be fine too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you are all as intrigued by this session as I am.  Spread the word! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, drinks and pizza will be served -- thanks for the donations they go to the cost of food and the use of Meetup.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter Marquez</member_name><member_id>4000314</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203025517000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195693455000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Cambridge Python December Meetup</name><id>6785407</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198108800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/6785407/</event_url></item>
