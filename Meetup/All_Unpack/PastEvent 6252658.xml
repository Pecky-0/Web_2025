So even if you're not a big gun person, feel free to come and wave signs.  Leave the talking to the pro-gun people though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be three blocks to sign up for.  This block is Sun, from 8:30 AM to 12:30PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, September 1st through Sunday, September 2nd there will be a gun show at the Everett Arena, 15 Loudon Road, Concord. This event draws a large number of pro-gun voters and it is important that we reach these folks with Ron Paul?s no-compromise 2nd Amendment record. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gun show will run from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Saturday and 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on Sunday. The official campaign will have a different staff person at the event from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM on Saturday, and then from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each of the three blocks of time we need ten individuals with a strong understanding of the issues surrounding gun ownership and the 2nd Amendment to distribute literature and answer any questions those attending the show may have about Dr. Paul and his record. The campaign will provide literature and Gun Owners for Paul buttons.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188909436000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188249518000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gun Show, Block 3</name><id>6252658</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188736200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6252658/</event_url></item>
