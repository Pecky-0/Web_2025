This is an event I scheduled for &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/CMEHKA/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt; on the suggestion of one of the members of that group, but I thought that this group would really enjoy it as well, since it is at the core an artistic event.  It is also a family friendly event and benefits a great cause.  In addition, since I am rarely in that area, I have planned a sushi event (&lt;a href="http://sushi.meetup.com/131/calendar/12845428/"&gt;http://sushi.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;) at a wonderful restaurant recommended by a friend who lives in South Norwalk (&lt;a href="http://www.kazusono.com/)"&gt;http://www.kazusono.c...&lt;/a&gt;.  You are welcome to come to dinner too!   The event is from 4:30 - 6:30.  Dinner is at 7 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See below for (way too much, probably) information:  &lt;br /&gt;------------------  &lt;br /&gt;From Covenant to Care website (&lt;a href="http://www.covenantto.."&gt;http://www.covenantto...&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br /&gt;**PLEASE NOTE YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE CONTACT PAGE TO RSVP: &lt;a href="http://www.covenantto.."&gt;http://www.covenantto...&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About The Discovered Spirit Project   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covenant to Care for Children (CCC) is pleased to announce our Discovered Spirit Project. This project is for children and youth with any experience in Connecticut’s Department of Children and Families, the Foster Care system or the CCC Mentoring Program. The project is intended to give them a voice by encouraging self-expression through art.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words alone are not enough to express what children feel. This is especially true when they are faced with the complex issues of divorce, grief, violence, abuse, neglect or coping with poverty. We are giving a voice to these children to express a wide range of emotions and help them work through conflicts and traumas. We expect to see an array of outcomes with our masks from the whimsical to the evocative. While expressing themselves in this visual way, the children gain a sense of empowerment that can help them develop a positive self-image and improve their selfesteem. Children will create masks guided by professional Connecticut artists, Donna Frustere, Karen Wright of Hartford, Katrina Franzen of Southport, Marta Cunha, and Julie Nearing of   &lt;br /&gt;Middletown, who are volunteering their time and talents to the project.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Southport Galleries in Fairfield County will display the masks created by the children, along with examples of the professional artists’ work. Sarah Biggers, gallery manager, has generously allowed use of this beautiful new Southport gallery located in the renovation of the village’s historic hardware store. At the Discovered Spirit Project gallery opening reception on Sunday, March 28, 2010, the masks will be available for sale with all proceeds supporting the programs CCC. Celebrity judges will present awards for the masks showing the greatest originality, presentation, and representation.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the gallery opening event, the masks will be available for viewing and purchase at the gallery through March 31, 2010. After this period, the masks will travel to faith-based sites throughout Connecticut as a traveling display during the following ten months. Our goal is to bring broader awareness of Covenant to Care for Children and the children we serve, offer an opportunity at recognition and accomplishment to the children participating, and build support of our programs.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also give a link to press release:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.covenantto.."&gt;http://www.covenantto...&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;br /&gt;--------------------   &lt;br /&gt;Caryl info from her posted idea:   &lt;br /&gt;Discovered Spirit Project is for youth with any   &lt;br /&gt;experience in Connecticut's DCF, the Foster Care system.
