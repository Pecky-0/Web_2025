<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;For our May meeting, the organizers have been working on setting up a factory tour - a break from our usual sit-down meeting routine. However, your help is required! Please RSVP either Yes or No to this event so that we can see how many people are interested, and inform the business owner of how many people are coming for the tour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: THIS LOCATION IS IN GREENFIELD, A 50 MINUTE DRIVE FROM OUR USUAL SPRINGFIELD, MA MEETING PLACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a members-only meeting which means you must have paid the full dues and signed the statement of ethics prior to the meeting to be able to attend. No visitors are allowed at this meeting because of confidentiality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a member of this meetup group is not the same as being a member of the Innovators Resource Network. Let us know if you have questions regarding this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: it is always a good idea to rsvp "Yes" to meetup events. That way organizers can contact only the people who rsvp'ed with any updates or changes to the event, instead of emailing the whole list.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Kat.</member_name><member_id>8999115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336053401000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334416748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Action Required - May Members-Only IRN Meeting</name><id>60552872</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335997800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/60552872/</event_url></item>
