I will have a table top sign with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are driving:   &lt;br /&gt;There are some commercial spots in front of the Trident that you can park in after 7 pm. Show up a little early and wait in your car till then. Make sure to check the signs so you don't get a ticket. If you can't find me, call me at 617-319-6712.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the the table top sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Edward Ramos</member_name><member_id>2018705</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234477503000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Web Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonweb</urlname><id>163691</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Web Design (and Dev) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218759200000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Web Design September Meetup</name><id>8547390</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221174000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonweb/events/8547390/</event_url></item>
