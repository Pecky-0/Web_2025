I've stopped by, peeked in the windows, checked the times and hey - they're open Monday night! It looks appropriately &amp;quot;bistro&amp;quot; with twinkle lights, a long black bar with lots of bead board with matching Thonet-style chairs and tables. Check out the website - it looks good! I think this might be a good one to know about. So, If you've ever driven by and said &amp;quot;Hey I need to check that one out&amp;quot;......here's your chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a blue messenger bag with me, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
