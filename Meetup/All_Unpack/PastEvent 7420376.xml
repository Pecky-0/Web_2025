The club, which had been closed since 2002, re-opened in March, 2007. I haven't been there since it reopened but it has great reviews! There is FREE VALET PARKING. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLUTCH CRABWELL  will be playing tonight.  &lt;br /&gt;There is a  $10.00 COVER CHARGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;&lt;b&gt;**NOTE: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color: black"&gt;We didn't make it last weekend due to the storm. Shall we try this again?  Anyone interested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>TBA: Please check for an update.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204507967000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>This has been posted as a must see band!</why><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204143814000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CLUTCH CRABWELL @ Gilrein's Home of the Blues</name><id>7420376</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204335000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/7420376/</event_url></item>
