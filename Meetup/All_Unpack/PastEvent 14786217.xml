This site is also good for those that dont want to paddle but join us later for the Barbie-q in the location being a nice place to simply walk and enjoy the area till we get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring comfortable clothes for the barbie-q, a chair, blanket or whatever, some Pot Luck food and your favourite Bugg Juice to drink whatever it is water to wine, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grill and acessories are loaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ready to cook up my shrimpers in butter, garlick, and some spices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: limegreen"&gt;OH in the found box is a small red and white soft side cooler with ice packs, \&lt;br /&gt;I removed the pickel rallish and refered it, it will be in my cooler for this event for Hut Doags.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes also everyone check the found box for your things..its getting full again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Tides for: Tides for Guilford Harbor: &lt;br /&gt;Sort of dosen't really matter this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Getting There Directions:&lt;br /&gt;GPS 400 Chaffinch Island Rd, Guilford, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Hartford, take I- 91 south to exit 22s toward Middletown.&lt;br /&gt;Take exit #13 for rte 17 south.&lt;br /&gt;At end of exit take a left and head toward Durham.&lt;br /&gt;Once in Durham bear right at the 79 and 17 split then left onto &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;rte 77&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the 17 split,&lt;br /&gt;(You are taking the center route of the 3 way splits) Remember its rte 77 south you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel south on Route 77 for approximately 13 miles to the center of Guilford. &lt;br /&gt;Cross rte 1, go strait.&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Broad Street and then take a quick left onto Whitfield Street driving around the Guilford Town Green. &lt;br /&gt;Continue south on Whitfield Street for approximately 0.2 miles. &lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Route 146 (Water Street) and travel approximately 1 mile. &lt;br /&gt;Turn a slight left onto Mulberry Point Road.

(Kate has to repair all the damage you make to the fiberglass and Gel coatings by doing this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Novices in short wide cheap plastic boats do that kind of thing because they simply don't know any better or don't care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE INFO ON THE FOLLOWING LINK: I will also show you the correct way &amp;amp; you will look like a intelligent seasoned pro to impress the others who don't know how.
