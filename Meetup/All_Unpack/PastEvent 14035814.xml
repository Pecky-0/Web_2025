Bring your suit and towel and something to share for food and/or drink and join us at 2:00 PM for swimming first, then dinner and maybe a meeting.   Because this event is at a private home, you must RSVP to get directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to bring your ideas for fall events, as we will be planning our September calendar at the meeting!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280173446000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278554834000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pool party, cook-out, and a meeting</name><id>14035814</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280080800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/14035814/</event_url></item>
