<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We're so thankful to everyone who has been hosting lately, but we miss having everyone over.  March certainly came in this year like a lion, so hopefully on this Saturday, we'll see it leave like a lamb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get together for good game playing.  Bring any favorites that you may have and anything you would care to drink.  The one time that we ordered pizza really worked well, so let's plan on doing that again this week.  If I remember correctly, we all got full on around $3-4 each.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may have never attended a Meetup, there are two cats in the house who will be put away for the evening.  Also, we do ask for donations of $1 a month to help with the administrative costs of the group.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. Don't you just love sheep?)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207506861000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204949488000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Usher out March</name><id>7488542</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206831600000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/7488542/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/a/global_3420666.jpeg</photo_url></item>
