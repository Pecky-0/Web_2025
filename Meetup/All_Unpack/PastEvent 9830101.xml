<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hey, everyone!  Our next meetup, and all others from here on out, will have one 202 board and at least two 101 boards.  As we've mentioned before, 202 is much more complicated than 101 and involves a STRONG knowledge of the principles that lead to success in 101.  This includes being able to accurately and quickly make changes to your Financial Statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the 202 board will be restricted to only those who have gotten out of the Rat Race at least FIVE times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll play until 4:30pm, then use the last half-hour for discussion and analysis of our gameplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please allow plenty of time for finding parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>From main entrance, first classroom on the left</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237747703000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235668890000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March 8 Cashflow Meetup</name><id>9830101</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236535200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/9830101/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
