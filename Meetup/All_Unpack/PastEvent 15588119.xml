Steampunk in the recent Hugo nominations includes &lt;i&gt;Boneshaker&lt;/i&gt; and &amp;quot;The Women of Nell Gwynne's&amp;quot;. Other steampunk stories I have read recently are &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.flashfictiononline.com/f20100703-sandra-plays-cast-iron-man-tom-crosshill.html" target="_blank"&gt;Sandra Plays for the Cast Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/story.php?s=72" target="_blank"&gt;A Serpent in the Gears&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. I'm sure you can think of more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I would call steampunk an aesthestic that looks back to Victorian times and reimagines how technology could be used. Tomorrow I might have a different definition. Let's take a look at &amp;quot;Steampunk: Form and Design.&amp;quot; Charles River &lt;a href="http://www.crmi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Museum of Industry&lt;/a&gt;, and see what we think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5 adult admission. &lt;br /&gt;I expect to meet near the front door. If you have trouble finding us, you can call my cell phone at 617-458-9790.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could adjourn afterward to a nearby coffee shop, such as Cafe on the Common. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is ample cheap parking on the Pine Street lot behind the Embassy Theater.&lt;br /&gt;A short walk from the commuter rail station on the  Porter Square/North Station line. Also accessible via buses from Watertown, Newton, Boston.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295824092000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291073152000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SteamPunk in SF Meetup </name><id>15588119</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295722800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/15588119/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/e/global_146222.jpeg</photo_url></item>
