I will email my cell to people who RSVP yes and maybe the day before just in case anyone has trouble finding us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we will head over to TGI Fridays to chat and mingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I have discounted tickets that cost $8.50, and I will also have discounted small popcorn and small drink tickets ($3 each).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on bringing any guests, please include them in the RSVP so I know how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you Wed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Old:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Eagle Eye&amp;quot; is a race-against-time thriller starring Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson, Anthony Mackie and Billy Bob Thornton.  Two strangers are thrown together by a mysterious phone call from a woman they have never met and are then pushed into a series of increasingly dangerous situations. As things escalate, these two ordinary people become the country's most wanted fugitives, with their every move being tracked and controlled through the technology of everyday life.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be out front and will email my cell to RSVPs.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223507704000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222428560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eagle Eye</name><id>8837485</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222902000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/8837485/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/5/global_5649621.jpeg</photo_url></item>
