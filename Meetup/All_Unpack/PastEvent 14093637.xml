This year's theme is &amp;quot;Marvelous Musicals.&amp;quot; Since I'm hosting one at the West Hartford Public Library in July I can't make it to these until August so I am just posting the August dates (except the 19th when I have a conflict - if you want to &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; that one let me know). If you want to see what's playing in July, check out the WPL website at: &lt;a href="http://www.windsorlibrary.com/programs.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.windsorlib...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 26th @ 7:00pm - BRIGADOON  (1954)&lt;br /&gt;Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Van Johnson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046807/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Americans Tommy Albright and Jeff Douglas, on a hunting vacation in Scotland, discover a quaint and beautiful village, Brigadoon. Strangely, the village is not on any map, and soon Tommy and Jeff find out why: Brigadoon is an enchanted place. It appears once every hundred years for one day, then disappears back into the mists of time, to wake up to its next day a century hence. When Tommy falls in love with Fiona, a girl of the village, he realizes that she can never be part of his life back in America. Can he be part of hers in Brigadoon?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282923503000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279060178000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brigadoon @ Windsor Public Library summer series - Marvelous Musicals </name><id>14093637</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282862700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/14093637/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
