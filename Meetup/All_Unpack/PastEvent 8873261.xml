<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I hope this is the first of many raw vegan pot luck dinners.  I want to meet and share with other raw vegans or people who are interested in more information about eating raw.  Our community is small but growing daily as more people realize only we can take care of our health and well being.  Whether you have been smart enough on your own to realize that our diet has to change or you have been banged over the head by a medical crisis as I was and forced to change there is much we can learn from each other.  Bring a dish...swap some recipes....ask questions...have some fun.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228513843000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222882240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food November Meetup</name><id>8873261</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226102400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/8873261/</event_url></item>
