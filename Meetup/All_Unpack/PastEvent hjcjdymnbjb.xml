Michael is an expert Law of Attraction trainer, best-seller author and radio host.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a recording of his TELE-training with us on Tues, 9/29.  We strongly recommend that you listen to this recording before you meetup with us on Tuesday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.audioacrobat.com/play/WgFCRqbS" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.audioacrobat.com/play/WgFCRqbS" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.audioacrob...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael informed us that the most immediate follow-up action to take after attending his training session is to take the time to sit down and do the &amp;quot;clarity through contrast&amp;quot; exercise. How many of us intend to do this, yet we get caught up in the busy-ness of our lives, and we never get going on this very critical first step of deliberate creation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us at our October get-together and let's support each other in putting into action this &amp;quot;clarity through contrast&amp;quot; first-step process of &lt;b&gt;Michael Losier's three-step process for deliberate attraction&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, youâ€™ll get to listen (via CDs** we have) of Michael Losier training you steps 2 and 3 of his three-step process for deliberate attraction.   (**Additional info &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; found in his book. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Added bonus:&lt;/i&gt; What you clarify you want -- are they really aligned harmoniously with your core values? You might be surprised. &lt;b&gt;You are most fulfilled when your intentions and activities are aligned with your core values.&lt;/b&gt; Clarifying your core values can help you in shaping your purpose and vision.  Come discover!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Buck and Chew-Hoong Koh, the co-organizers of the BostonLOA Meetup, will be the facilitators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; ONLY if you know you are coming!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually provide handouts and have appetizers &amp;amp; refreshments. So, to keep &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; &amp;amp; cost down, please RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; only when you can honor your commitment &amp;amp; show up.  Many of you have been wonderful with this and we very much appreciate your understanding and support!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;For &lt;b&gt;parking and directions (via T or driving)&lt;/b&gt; info to Dave's loft :&lt;br /&gt;(1) Go here:&lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/files/"&gt;http://lawofattractio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Sign in&lt;br /&gt;(3) Scroll down and open file &amp;quot;Directions &amp;amp; Parking_BostonLOA Meetup&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Buck</member_name><member_id>2466801</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chew-Hoong</member_name><member_id>3101506</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255476630000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Law of Attraction Co-Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lawofattraction-us</urlname><id>368525</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>50</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251849722000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Put Into Action Michael Losier's Three-Step Process for Deliberate Attraction</name><id>hjcjdymnbjb</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254870000000</time><rsvp_limit>75</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lawofattraction-us/events/11263276/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/0/f/global_10979647.jpeg</photo_url></item>
