When an earthquake hits, nine men and women  of diverse ages and backgrounds are trapped in an Indian consulate.  Cameron, an African American Vietnam vet, takes charge, striving to keep  them safe. College student Uma, who brought along The Canterbury Tales  to read while waiting for clerk Malathi and her boss Mangalam to process  her papers, suggests that they each tell an "important story" from  their lives. Their tales of heartbreak and revelation are nuanced and  riveting as Divakaruni takes fresh measure of the transcendent power of  stories and the pilgrimage tradition. True, the nine, including an older  couple, a young Muslim man, and a Chinese Indian grandmother and her  granddaughter, are captives of a disaster, but they are also pilgrims of  the spirit, seeking "one amazing thing" affirming that life, for all  its pain, is miraculous. A storyteller of exquisite lyricism and  compassion, Divakaruni weaves a suspenseful, astute, and unforgettable  survivors' tale.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Community Room, downstairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annie</member_name><member_id>1543974</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333414248000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paradisecityreaders</urlname><id>1404829</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Paradise City Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302627805000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April: One Amazing Thing, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruna</name><id>17278046</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333407600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paradisecityreaders/events/17278046/</event_url></item>
