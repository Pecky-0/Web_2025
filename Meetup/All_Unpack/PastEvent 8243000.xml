The walk around the lake is a picturesque 4 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It's hard to believe that tranquil Lake Quannapowitt, in Wakefield, MA, is just off manic Route 128. The Lake offers numerous recreational opportunities, including a lovely four mile walk around the scenic body of water. A pretty town green, open park land and a playground offer additional scenic and recreational opportunities at this jewel in the middle of northwest suburbia. Wakefield also has a nice, old-fashioned downtown with charming, old brick town buildings, a classic New England village green, independently-owned local shops and covenient parallel parking. For a town with a population of around 25,000, the Lake and small-town downtown make it seem like a much smaller town.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thai lunch afterwards at:&lt;br /&gt;Duck WALK On Wakefield SQ&lt;br /&gt;397A Main St&lt;br /&gt;Wakefield, MA 01880-3017&lt;br /&gt;Phone: (781) 246-3715&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217374293000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214790659000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quannapowitt Lake walk</name><id>8243000</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217080800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/8243000/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/d/global_4628669.jpeg</photo_url></item>
