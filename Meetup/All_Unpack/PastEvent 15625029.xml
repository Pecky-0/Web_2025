What aspect of the plot, a character, a scene, etc impressed you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come share what you loved about it.  What did it teach you?&lt;br /&gt;What emotions in you did it resonate with?  Tell us how it changed you?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What authors do you recommend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or do you have a story to tell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Meetup will be divided into two parts.  First we'll discuss favorite stories, novels, authors, etc.  If you have a short scene from a work you'd like to read to the group bring it along.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the second part, we'll have some fun with some story making exercises.   We'll start off with Bev's telephone idea.  What is crucial to the creative process?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;b&gt;New Meetup location:&lt;/b&gt; The Watertown Public Library has been kind enough to allow us to use one of their meeting rooms.  This will allow for a discussion without a lot of outside noise.  The meeting room is on the second floor, it is the Lucia Mastrangelo Meeting Room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; 1PM - 4PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking:&lt;/b&gt; Behind the library is some parking which should be free on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;Also, behind the CVS is a large parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Find us up on the second floor in the glass meeting room with the tables and white board.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim B</member_name><member_id>1113365</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292557936000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291331397000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Story Making: Favorite Fiction &amp; Story Making</name><id>15625029</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292176800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/15625029/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/d/global_8294813.jpeg</photo_url></item>
