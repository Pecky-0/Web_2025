We will be calling in the reservation for all on Friday 4.23 at 1:00.  With a crowd this big we are not sure how they will be seating us or if we will be sitting at one big table or how close we will be to each other.  If this is a problem then this may not be the event for you and please change your RSVP or if your plans have changed and you won’t be able to attend please go in and change your RSVP, so we give the correct count to the restaurant, thank you for your help!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit about Tavern in the Square: We are a neighborhood restaurant &amp;amp; bar focusing on great food &amp;amp; beverage, sports, entertainment, atmosphere and outstanding service. As with all our restaurants we pride ourselves on being an integral part of the neighborhood and community.  We have been there to check out their menu and the food is wicked good, and the buffet is “really big”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a list of the items that they will have on their buffet go to: &lt;a href="http://www.taverninthesquare.com/tavsalem/content/home" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.taverninth...&lt;/a&gt; click on food and scroll down to the bottom of the page and check out all the items on the buffet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be scheduling this event on all 3 of our meetup sites, we will have to make reservations for all of us if you RSVP yes and your plans change please update your reservation as soon as you are able, seeing you may be taking up a spot that someone else could have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost for the buffet:&lt;br /&gt;Adults: $16.99&lt;br /&gt;Children: $8.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you at this event!&lt;br /&gt;Donna &amp;amp; Janet&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Meetup Table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272463735000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>A-Circle-of-Friends</urlname><id>1421257</id><group_lat>42.8100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8799972534</group_lon><name>A Circle of Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267320820000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's go to Sunday Brunch.</name><id>12729279</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272209400000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/A-Circle-of-Friends/events/12729279/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/4/global_9199748.jpeg</photo_url></item>
