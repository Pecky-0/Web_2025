This will act as the summer extension to the Japanese Lunch Table language exchange that already takes place at MIT during the academic year.  We meet every Wednesday from 12:30 to 2:00 pm.  Of course, all ages are welcome and feel free to bring friends, family, and (of course) lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week, we will be meeting at MIT's BioCafe in Building 68.  The following links will show you where you will need to walk in order to reach the BioCafe from the Kendall/MIT T stop, along with an image of Building 68.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/~rschuman/www/bio_cafe_map.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.mit.edu/~r...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building Image:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/~rschuman/www/building_68.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.mit.edu/~r...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;From the Outbound Kendall/MIT T stop, cross the street (away from the Marriott), and take a right past the Inbound Kendall/MIT T stop, walking up Main Street.  Pass &amp;quot;The Kendall&amp;quot; on your left and  &amp;quot;The Coop&amp;quot; on your right.  At the stop light, cross the street and bear left onto Ames Street.  Enter through the main doors of Building 68 on your right, and walk toward the Bio Cafe on your left.  The Bio Cafe is on the ground floor and can be easily seen from the hallway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case any of you have any difficulties in getting to the Bio Cafe, please feel free to contact either Yutaka or myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183134901000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182720147000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summer Lunch Table - Language Exchange</name><id>5930532</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1182961800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/5930532/</event_url></item>
