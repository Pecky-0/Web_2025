Saturday August 7 starting at 9 am and running till when ever. Bring your Kayak (if you have one), also your  chairs and  refreshments. Dress appropriately for the weather. This should be a great Summers outing and a chance to meet up with some very interesting and energetic people. Not to mention there will be a collection of great boats to view and boating techniques to talk about. Clint will be in an orange Kayak so look for the boat and let's get a group of new friends together and enjoy the day. We look forward to seeing you there. If you have any questions, ideas and or would like to help host future meet ups please email clintguy  North Shore Dance and Party Meet Up is not organizing the Kayak races. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for an orange Kayak on the beach.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Clint Guy</member_name><member_id>9812493</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281362816000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Millionaires</urlname><id>1477459</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Millionaires</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278975601000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Kayak Meet Up and Social</name><id>14082365</id><headcount>100</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281186000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Millionaires/events/14082365/</event_url></item>
