<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I reserved the function room at Portugalia Restaurant.  The room can hold up to 35 people, which I thought would give the group a change to have a larger event.  There's a possibility of ordering off the menu, but most likely there will be a buffet for a set price of about $20 per person (not including beverages.)  I'll send out more information about the menu after I see how many people are interested in coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have dinner and then do some socializing afterwards.  We have the whole room, which will make it easier for people to mingle and socialize.  For anyone who is familiar with Portuguese food, Portugalia Restaurant specializes in Bakalu (salt cod) and food from northern Portugal.  If anyone has suggestion for the menu, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the web site for the restaurant: &lt;a href="http://www.portugaliaincambridge.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.portugalia...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the function room at the restaurant</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234740992000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>41</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232388976000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Portugalia Restaurant</name><id>9556527</id><headcount>42</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234051200000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/9556527/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/3/global_1218899.jpeg</photo_url></item>
