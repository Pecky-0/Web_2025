In addition to the cultural challenges and language barriers that many immigrants face, and in addition to the usual hoops architects must jump through get licensed in the US, foreign architects also have to pass through series of additional steps in order to become licensed here.  The Alien Architects Roundtable is a BSA committee dedicated to helping people navigate this process.*&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Boston Society of Architects/ AIA honors this rapidly-growing, dedicated group of Boston architects at this special event. 2007 BSA President Hubert Murray AIA, RIBA and the 2008 BSA President Diane Georgopulos FAIA invite you to be their guest at the Presidents' Holiday Reception for Architects from Other Nations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please pass this invitation along to your foreign architect friends and colleagues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE RSVP to&lt;br /&gt;617-951-1433 x221 or bsa@architects.org&lt;br /&gt;as well as on the Meetup site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The Alien Architects Roundtable meets monthly at the BSA office, usually the 1st Thursday at 6PM.
