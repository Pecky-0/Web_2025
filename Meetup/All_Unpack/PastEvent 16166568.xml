Doors open at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;strong&gt;get there early . . . even before 6:45 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served for the main lecture room. The overflow crowd sits in a separate screening room. Admission is free.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rooftop stargazing through telescopes after the presentation... weather permitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the "staff only" signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box. Mass Ave buses (to points in Arlington and North Cambridge) originate in Harvard Square on the Red Line and travel along Massachusetts Avenue, which is about a 10-minute walk from the auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A line forms early for this event. Please do not cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. At this point, we can collect everyone from the lecture hall and the overflow viewing room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the left rear of the lecture hall is a way to let people find me and an empty seat that much more easily. The lectures are lots of fun, though, and I can certainly understand if you would like to sit up front and closer to the (very entertaining!) talks. Please sit where you are most comfortable. If you are bringing children to the event, you may want to sit toward the front so they can see and ask questions. We will be able to chat after the lecture, while we wait in line for a chance to stargaze through the several rooftop telescopes. Each telescope is usually trained on a different sight in the nighttime sky, so waiting in several lines gives us plenty of time to introduce ourselves. And plenty of exciting objects to observe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****  &lt;br /&gt;After stargazing, we will meet at the Algiers Coffee House in Harvard Square:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algiers Coffee House  &lt;br /&gt;40 Brattle Street  &lt;br /&gt;Cambridge, MA 02138  &lt;br /&gt;617.492.1557  &lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll wait a bit to collect as many of us as possible before being seated. Ask for Marianne&amp;rsquo;s table if you can&amp;rsquo;t find us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Algiers Coffee House is open every night until midnight, so I will have plenty of time to warm up with their hot chocolate. You will be able to order a meal, too, if you wish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the CfA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Observatory Night&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mission to Touch the Sun," Justin Kasper, CfA&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Although our Sun is 100,000 times closer than any other star, it still holds plenty of mysteries. A proposed mission -- Solar Probe Plus -- will explore the Sun in a way no spacecraft has before, swooping to within four million miles of the solar surface. It will carry the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) instrument to directly sample the Sun's outer atmosphere. Tonight, SWEAP principal investigator Justin Kasper will describe the challenges of designing an instrument to "touch" the Sun.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/images/SolarProbePlus_sm.jpg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
