Deer, Turkey, Grey fox or Red fox, great Blue and little blue and Snowies and yellow legs, Hummers, a few kind of Flycatchers, Screech Owl and baby and all that was this AM or PM in the backyard. Badgered by the House wrens.My motive is simply just to see how it's done. This area is one of only a few IBH area's around.....And it shows. Crack of dawn or dusk are the best and a big tide sure helps.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Hilton</member_name><member_id>12226869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301260941000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Nature-Photographers</urlname><id>1511747</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>New England Nature Photographers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277087305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Audubon's North River Sanctuary...</name><id>16236323</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301256000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Nature-Photographers/events/16236323/</event_url></item>
