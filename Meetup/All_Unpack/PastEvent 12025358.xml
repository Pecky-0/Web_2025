<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I heard about this really nice old country inn &amp;amp; tavern with a grist mill and old school house, so I thought it would be a good place to go for lunch after a walk. Its in Sudbury, so please try to carpool for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upper Mill Brook Conservation Area (60.6 acres) is a diverse property which contains both open and wooded swamps, deciduous woodland, a brook and several ponds, with beavers in residence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a basic tour takes about 45 minutes, additional extensions onto Wayland conservation land can add up to another 2 hours. The main trail is easy; however the extension to Claypit Hill Road is moderately difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trail map at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.svtweb.org/upper-mill-brook-conservation-area" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.svtweb.org...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;Peace Lutheran Church at 107 Concord Road (Route 126) allows its parking lot to be used for public parking when it is not being used for church activities; we will be arriving after their morning services so it should be ok . There are also footpath entrances from Concord Road, Glezen Lane and Claypit Hill Road. From the intersection of Routes 126 and 27 in Wayland (at the Wayland Public Library, just north of Route 20), go north on Route 126 approximately 1 mile to the Peace Lutheran Church on your right. Park at the back of their parking lot; an informational kiosk is located in the back of their lawn, behind a small fenced in playground, the trail starts from the kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch afterwards at:&lt;br /&gt;Longfellow's Wayside Inn · 72 Wayside Inn Road · Sudbury, MA 01776 · 978/443-1776 · 800/339-1776 · info@wayside.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wayside.org/dining/lunch" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wayside.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longfellow's Wayside Inn—a nationally significant historic landmark—is an old Inn and tavern that has been serving travelers along the old Boston Post Road for almost 300 years. What began as an extension of David Howe's family home in 1716, the Inn has thrived through years of growth and expansion and survived because of its important history and beautiful setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From its Colonial roots to Henry Ford's historic preservation of the property as a living museum of American history, the Wayside Inn offers a unique experience of history—a step back in time in a warm and hospitable setting. The Inn is the perfect backdrop for your own memory-making occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longfellow's Wayside Inn offers quiet settings for a leisurely visit, historic rooms for dining with family and friends, and comfortable guest rooms. The Inn serves lunch and dinner 364 days a year and has ten guest rooms for overnight accommodation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260893293000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260048136000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Upper Mill Brook Conservation Area walk</name><id>12025358</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260720000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/12025358/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/1/9/global_12094121.jpeg</photo_url></item>
