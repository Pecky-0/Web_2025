Some more info.&lt;br /&gt;Location: MUB (Memorial Union Building) Theater 1 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;We are a really dynamic organization that is working with local businesses to help them become more sustainable: we evaluate out businesses, rate and score them and help promote them to the community through outreach, education and creative messaging. We also are a co-op where residents can access all of our green goods and services at a discount. We are a green Business to Business Networking group; all of our green business owners come together on a monthly basis to strategize and promote their businesses with sustainability a priority. I also put out a newsletter called the Alliance GAzette, which goes out to well over 8,000 green-leaning Seacoast residents each month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been working on energy/environmental/advocacy issues in the community for the past 10 years; I have been on City Council, the Zoning Board and currently serve as the Chair of the Kittery Energy Committee (a group which I formed).&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more about the Seacoast Green Alliance by visiting their website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.greenalliance.biz &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232067360000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Green Earthlings</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-286</urlname><id>459660</id><group_lat>43.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast  Energy and Permaculture Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228484579000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seacoast Green Alliance</name><id>9285782</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228944600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-286/events/9285782/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/2/global_6513314.jpeg</photo_url></item>
