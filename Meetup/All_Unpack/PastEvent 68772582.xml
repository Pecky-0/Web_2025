&lt;p&gt;This is an all Skill Level Ride !!!  You will have 3 Rides to choose from.  The Routes  are already marked from a Ride I just did.  I also have Maps.  You can Ride 34, 15, or 7 Miles.  Feel free to combine them, if you like.  I plan to do the 15 &amp;amp; then the 7.  I want to stay with the Newer Riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ride # 1, 34 Miles: I just did it &amp;amp; really enjoyed it.  The Inclines / Hills, were not that long &amp;amp; were easy to climb.  You will Love the sections by the Ocean &amp;amp; Beaches.  There are places to stop, if you want to stop for Lunch or a Snack.  The Roads are marked &amp;amp; easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ride #2,  15 Miles, I have never Ridden this Route.  It is Marked  &amp;amp; should be easy to follow. The Terrain is similar  to the Narragansett Lighthouse Ride or my Goddard Park Ride. I am basing this on the 34 Mile Ride, Terrain.    This is good for those who want to get some Road experience &amp;amp; some Exercise.  I will be doing this Ride, so Newer Riders, should feel comfortable, giving it a try.  If you are not sure, take the Challenge &amp;amp; give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ride #3,  7 Miles, This is good for Beginners &amp;amp; those who have Children, either Biking or in Tow.  Again the Route is Marked &amp;amp; I have a Map.  I plan to Ride this Route, after I Ride the 15 Mile Route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT :  You must bring either 1 or 2 Spare Tubes  or the Phone # of a Local Cab. I can change a flat, but you MUST provide the Tube !!!!  FYI; I carry inflaters with me.  Those doing the 34 Mile Ride, you are on your own, but I am confident you will be OK.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave N.</member_name><member_id>10478672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340644528000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339462630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ride Around Southern R.I.</name><id>68772582</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340546400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/68772582/</event_url></item>
