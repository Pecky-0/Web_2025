We will leave at 9:10.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The hike and picnic lunch will be a minimum of 3 hours, but could go substantially longer depending on how people are feeling.  We will probably hike anywhere from 2.5 to 3.5 miles&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring along your camera, binoculars and &lt;u&gt;bug spray&lt;/u&gt;.  We spotted baby kingbirds and baby tufted titmouses here. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massaudubo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the web site are fine; the only thing being that you have to look carefully for a very small white sign on the turn off Route 97 - and again for the turn into the wildlife center, which is about another mile or so after you make that turn. The address is 87 Perkins Row (not Perkins Lane). &lt;br /&gt;If you like, you can also print out a trail map in advance from the above website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the sanctuary does charge a $4 per person entrance fee. There are restrooms on site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting some of you and seeing some of you again! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>7</waitlist_count><updated>1279981994000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278190023000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Birding walk at Ipswich River- slow with many stops- with Picnic Lunch</name><id>13994294</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279371600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/13994294/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/6/global_6592598.jpeg</photo_url></item>
