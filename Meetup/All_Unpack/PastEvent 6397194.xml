<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>In September we will be discussing the fourth and final part of the Secret Book of John. Please download the .pdf (labeled as July) from the Files section of the Meetup group and bring your questions and insights for discussion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part three of our Secret Book of John discussion ended with the creation of Adam and the chief archon blowing his spirit into Adam. Part four begins with the creation of Eve and follows Genesis through the remainder of the story ending with Jesus returning to the pleroma, his message being passed into humanity for safekeeping. This reading will make you real excited to be a Gnostic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what we need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Someone to volunteer to read the reading. ()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Someone to bring coffee ()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Someone to bring a snack ()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll handle the printed material and the supplies for the Logos Service. Please RSVP either Yes, No, or Maybe. It really helps us plan for our meetings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as always, please contact me with any question, comments or concerns!&lt;br /&gt;In Gnosis,&lt;br /&gt;Anthony&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
