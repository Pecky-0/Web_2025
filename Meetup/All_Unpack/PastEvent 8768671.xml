It not only enhances fertility (increasing plant growth/yield) but also sequesters carbon in the soil (rather releasing it into the atmosphere).  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar#Co-benefits_of_pyrolysis" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read about the historic use of this technique in the highly sought after Terra Preta (dark soil) of the Amazon Basin &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who really want to get their hands dirty with this new/ancient technique, we are meeting at The Bike Barn on the morning of the Seed Swap in order to cook up some BioChar (aka Terra Preta).  Aaron has been experimenting with a kiln design for making the charcoal so this will be a bit of show-and-tell to see the design and to run through a real process for making the char.  We will discuss the entire process from start to finish, including some ideas for incorporating it into the soil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring work gloves, sensible shoes and some food to cook over the kiln for lunch.  Stay for the seed swap at 2pm if you can! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see our Meetup Event RSVP Guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://permaculture.meetup.com/58/messages/boards/thread/5233158#20208623"&gt;http://permaculture.m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event is full and you would like to get on the waiting list for an open spot, RSVP &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; with a comment that you'd like to get in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring your own potluck kit (plate/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin)!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225120333000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221583809000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skill-Builder: Making BioChar (Terra Preta) in Maine</name><id>8768671</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224943200000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/8768671/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/7/global_5536103.jpeg</photo_url></item>
