<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Herb Pearce continues to teach us more about the amazing Enneagram of Personality.  Here is a description of the workshop from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Learn about topics beyond the Enneagram Basics. You don't know the Enneagram until you understand the many subtypes of the Instinctual Subtypes and Subtype Stacking, Centers, Stress and Secure Points, Sequencing, Parental Types and much more.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Herb always has great snacks. Great food, company and an interesting topic - an awesome way to spend a Friday night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296318920000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292985059000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Advanced Enneagram Workshop</name><id>15795402</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296261000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/15795402/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/8/global_7203288.jpeg</photo_url></item>
