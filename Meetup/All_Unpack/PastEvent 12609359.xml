The project is intended to give them a voice by encouraging self-expression through art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words alone are not enough to express what children feel. This is especially true when they are faced with the complex issues of divorce, grief, violence, abuse, neglect or coping with poverty. We are giving a voice to these children to express a wide range of emotions and help them work through conflicts and traumas. We expected to see an array of outcomes with our masks from the whimsical to the evocative and we are not disappointed. While expressing themselves in this visual way, the children gained a sense of empowerment that can help them develop a positive self-image and improve their self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The participants created masks guided by professional Connecticut artists, who volunteered their time and talents to the project, Donna Frustere,and Karen Wright of Hartford; Katrina Franzen of Southport; and Marta Cunha and Julie Nearing of Middletown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masks are part of a juried show displayed at Southport Galleries in Fairfield County, along with examples of the professional artists' work. Sarah Biggers, gallery manager, has generously allowed use of this beautiful new Southport gallery located in the renovation of the village's historic hardware store. At the Discovered Spirit Project artists' reception on Sunday, March 28, 2010, the masks will be available for sale with all proceeds supporting the programs of CCC. Celebrity judges: Congressman John Larson, State Representative Gary Holder-Winfield, and Yvonne Harris, Event Coordinator for Hartford's Artist Collective will present awards for the masks showing the greatest originality, presentation, and representation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masks will be available for viewing and purchase at the gallery until March 31, 2010. After this period, the masks will travel to faith-based sites throughout Connecticut as a traveling display during the following ten months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Our goal is to bring broader awareness of Covenant to Care for Children and the children we serve, offer an opportunity at recognition and accomplishment to the children participating, and build support of our programs.&amp;quot; stated Discovered Spirit Project Committee Chair and Hartford artist, Diann Cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a free event. &amp;quot;We hope our guests will purchase the masks and or make donations but this event is more about bringing awareness of our children to a higher level.&amp;quot; Says Covenant to Care for Children CEO, Caryl Hallberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl Anthony Catering is building a creative appetizer menu based on traditional kids menu favorites but bringing them to the standards of a refined adult palate for the reception. A selection of wines juices and soft drinks have been collected to complement the the afternoon's festivities during the reception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Southport Galleries is located at 330 Pequot Ave, Southport, www.southportgalleries.com .
