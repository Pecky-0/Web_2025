That means biking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me on Thursday at 5:45 on a trip from Barrington on the East Bay Bikepath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The East Bay bike path is 14.5 miles of paved bike path from Bristol to Providence. It's pretty flat except for a hill or two at the Providence side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at Colt State Park in Bristol, Rhode Island. We'll start from the parking lot across the street from the North Cemetary on Asylum Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE remember to take my cell phone number: 401-699-7304 in case you can't find us. As usual, I will be sporting my signature red road bike. I drive a red car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING WATER WITH YOU!!! Also, maybe a few bucks for a drink or something along the way.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Try Adam's cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281707856000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281573336000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last minute bikeride ~26 miles NOT super fast!</name><id>14396579</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281649500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/14396579/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/8/9/global_10096745.jpeg</photo_url></item>
