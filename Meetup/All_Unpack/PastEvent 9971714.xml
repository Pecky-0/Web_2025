Celebrate the end of &amp;quot;indoor cycling season&amp;quot; (for some) by taking a ride on a flying bicycle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an unassuming little house in the suburbs of Gorham which hides inside a collection of vintage pinball and arcade games, among them, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?letter=&amp;amp;game_id=9139" target="_blank"&gt;Prop Cycle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. In this 1996 game, the player operates a flying bicycle by sitting astride an exercise bike and pedaling to keep him/herself afloat while steering with the handle bars. The player's main objective is to burst balloons, thereby gaining points, by running into them. Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvILa7J42Fc" target="_blank"&gt;video of the game being played&lt;/a&gt;. It's great fun! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's take a road trip to Gorham to give this bicycle-controlled game a try (his other games will be open too, all for free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also take some time to discuss and plan the upcoming season, where I anticipate once more a great increase in bicycle commuting in Portland. I'll bring the food and drink. Please consider ways that YOU can help out with the Meetup group this year, and spread the word about bicycle transportation! Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear the red Meetup shirt</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241049356000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237286050000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come Fly With Me! + Spring Planning Meeting</name><id>9971714</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238346000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/9971714/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/global_7716072.jpeg</photo_url></item>
