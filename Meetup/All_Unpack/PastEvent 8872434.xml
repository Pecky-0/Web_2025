As I understand it, this is a hosted jam; therefore, no gear required other than your horn or axe. I've never paid attention to how drummers do jams; I would imagine you'd need sticks. &lt;b&gt;There is a $5 cover charge here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing people in this group I've met before and those of you who haven't yet come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is short notice, and I apologize for that. Next meetup will be scheduled further in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see as many of you there as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tall, half-japanese.
