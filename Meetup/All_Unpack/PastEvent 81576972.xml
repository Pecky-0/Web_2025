&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Northern Confederacy? Was the Hartford Convention of 1814 an Attempt to Save the Unionâ€”or Secede from it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By the fall of 1814, the opposition of New England Federalists to the War of 1812 was so vehement that the Union appeared to be in danger. In October, Massachusetts invited the other New England states to send delegates to a meeting in Hartford, Connecticut, to draft constitutional amendments and take other measures to protect New England interests. &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Peter Drummey,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Stephen T. Riley Librarian of the Massachusetts Historical Society, will discuss the Hartford Convention and the taint of secession and treason associated with it, and show how debate over the goals of the Convention has persisted for almost two centuries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its fall and lecture season is back! I enjoy these historical talks and looking forward to this one. Old south puts on some good talks and if you haven't been yet the historic building is neat too (the Boston tea party was planned here). As with the other talks I've put up here I'll wait outside until about 5 minutes before. If you're late or don't spot the group don't worry! I'll also wait in the back right (facing the stage- away from the door) after the talk too. If people are interested in grabbing a bit / drink after the talk there are plenty of good options around for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk in particular looks interesting to me. What was the Hartford Convention? An attempt from the North to succeed from the south? How would &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; civil war have played out and what would have happened to "America" today because of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to last week's talk and it was pretty academic. Its hard to tell how these talks will go without having seen the speaker before but I'm hoping for a good one here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wait outside until about 5 minutes before AND will wait in the back after - see details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>2367399</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347515171000</updated><rating><average>2.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347206609000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Old South Meeting House Historical talk on the war of 1812: The rebel north?</name><id>81576972</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347488100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/81576972/</event_url></item>
