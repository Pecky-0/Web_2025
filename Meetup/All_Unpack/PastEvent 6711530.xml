The Brattle's website says &amp;quot;The Show Must Go On!&amp;quot; and the screening will proceed as planned despite the snow.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advance tickets for Thursday's screening of &amp;quot;Willy Wonka &amp;amp; the Chocolate Factory&amp;quot; have sold out.  A limited number of tickets will be available at the Box Office at 6:30 on the night of the show and The Brattle says they've had some cancellations, so there will be a fair number of tickets available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First presented this summer at a special outdoor screening in Union Square, the Smell-O-Vision &amp;quot;Willy Wonka&amp;quot; experience was designed by a crack team of olfactory technicians and local artists.  The Brattle is ecstatic that this soon to be local phenomenon has chosen our humble cinema as their first indoor location.  Do not miss this chance to experience the classic family film &amp;quot;Willy Wonka &amp;amp; The Chocolate Factory&amp;quot; in a whole new sensory dimension.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger Ebert says: &amp;quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&amp;quot; is probably the best film of its sort since &amp;quot;The Wizard of Oz.&amp;quot;  It is everything that family movies usually claim to be, but aren't: Delightful, funny, scary, exciting, and, most of all, a genuine work of imagination. &amp;quot;Willy Wonka&amp;quot; is such a surely and wonderfully spun fantasy that it works on all kinds of minds, and it is fascinating because, like all classic fantasy, it is fascinated with itself.&amp;quot;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the complete review at: &lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19710101/REVIEWS/50720001/1023" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://rogerebert.sun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is our custom, Nina will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row after the film and then it's off to a moderately priced local restaurant to discuss.  (Unless we stop at Hidden Sweets for a sugar fix first!)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201455662000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194645919000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory In Smell-O-Vision!</name><id>6711530</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197592200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6711530/</event_url></item>
