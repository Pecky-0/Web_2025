That weekend will be the last time Abbotts will be serving for the 2009 season. We will be having cocktails (BYOB) and dinner on the open deck by the marina (watch out for sea gulls), enjoying good conversation and a lot of laughs. That's what we are all about. Come celebrate the last weekend of the summer with us..... we will be looking forward to seeing you :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The restaurant is actually in Noank which is part of Groton, but the computer would not allow me to plug in NOANK.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>"I will have a MEETUP SIGN ON THE TABLE."</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252354334000</updated><rating><average>3.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251358054000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Abbott's In The Rough!!!</name><id>11213729</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252180800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/11213729/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/3/global_10412291.jpeg</photo_url></item>
