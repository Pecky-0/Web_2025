<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's been a while since we've done one of these, but with the big fundraiser this weekend, it would be good to have signs at some overpasses on Monday and Tuesday.  Ron Paul's name recognition is very good now, so it's time to make some signs on the issues.  The party will be in Pembroke, just east of Concord.  This is the historic house where Ron Paul had his first house party after announcing his exploratory committee.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got paint, but we need someone who has Tyvek, and any supplies to help make signs.  Also, feel free to bring some snacks, drinks, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should be a bunch of people from Operation Live Free or Die there, so please welcome our guests who have dropped everything to come campaign for Dr Paul!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address below shows up as Suncook, but it should be Pembroke&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197939846000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197669296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign Making Party</name><id>6913702</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197766800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6913702/</event_url></item>
