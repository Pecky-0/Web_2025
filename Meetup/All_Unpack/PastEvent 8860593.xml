A brilliant, bright comedienne, Carole Lombard had the rare quality of being as elegant drenched in water or with a pie in her face, as she was with her willowy figure draped in long, shimmering gowns. Classic Hollwood Bios&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember her primarily from &lt;b&gt;My Man Godfrey&lt;/b&gt;- beautiful, charming, and downright hilarious. What I didn't know was that she died at the age of 34 in an airplane crash in 1942 while raising funds for WWII  bonds .  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in celebration of the occasion of Carole Lombard's  100th birthday, The Brattle is presenting a retrospective of her films. This is a two for one double-feature. We'll have our post-film discussion after  the 5:30 screening of &lt;b&gt;Twentieth Century&lt;/b&gt; at a local restuarant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b]To Be Or Not To Be&lt;/b&gt;  5 stars All-Movie.com&lt;br /&gt;In Warsaw at the beginning of WWII, Maria Tura (Lombard) and husband Joseph (Jack Benny) perform anti-Nazi plays with their theater troupe until they are forced to switch to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Lt. Stanislav Sobinski  falls for Maria and meets up with her during Joseph's famous &amp;quot;To Be or Not to Be&amp;quot; speech as Hamlet. When Stanislav is eventually dispatched for war, he implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The Polish theater troupe is then forced to use their theatrical skills to ensure their survival. Eventually, they turn to impersonating Nazi officers — and even Hitler himself — in order to outwit the enemy and keep the resistance safe from spies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twentieth Century&lt;/b&gt; 4.5 stars All-Movie.com&lt;br /&gt;Flamboyant, egomaniacal theatrical impresario Oscar Jaffe (John Barrymore) transforms chorus girl Mildred Plotka (Carole Lombard) into leading lady Lily Garland, the toast of Broadway. Once she's ascended to stardom, Mildred/Lily cannot abide Jaffe's obsessive control of her life and career. When he hires a private detective  to keep tabs on her, it's the last straw. Lily whisks herself off to Hollywood, where she quickly becomes a top movie star. Months pass: without his &amp;quot;creation&amp;quot; to star in his productions, Jaffe goes bankrupt. With his faithful stooges   in tow, Jaffe boards the Twentieth Century Limited Train, one step ahead of his creditors. By an incredible coincidence, Lily is also on the Twentieth Century Train. With near-maniacal glee, Jaffe undertakes the herculean task of signing Lily to star in his upcoming spectacular staging of &amp;quot;The Passion Play&amp;quot;. Now the laughs, which have been erupting at safe intervals for the past 45 minutes, really begin to cascade, with Oscar, Lily, and a wide variety of eccentrics chasing each other around the Twentieth Century as it speeds its way from Chicago to New York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tom will be holding a meetup sign, near the front-row after 20th Century</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222735322000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Two  Carole Lombard Screwball Comedies at The Brattle</name><id>8860593</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224444600000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8860593/</event_url></item>
