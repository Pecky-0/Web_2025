&lt;p&gt;Chardonnay is perhaps the most ubiquitous white Vinifera grape in the world, being grown in just about every wine region.  The versatility of the chardonnay has allowed it to be made into a wide variety of wine styles, from the sparkling bruts of Champagne, the crispness of a Chablis, the restrained elegance of white Burgundy, and all the way to the buttery fruit bombs of CA that have sparked the "ABC" or "Anything But Chardonnay" back-lash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we'll have a Chardonnay Smack-Down and sample several styles in one night to illustrate how Chardonnay has become king (queen?) of the white wine world.  Which style will you prefer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will also be a wine evaluation night to prepare for the AWS National Tasting Project on June 21. Mike will present Basic Wine Evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appetizer volunteers are greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noel</member_name><member_id>8463776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336580374000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>White Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1441608</id><group_lat>42.5900001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333906891000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chardonnay Smack-down &amp; Wine Evalution Overview</name><id>59731052</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336518000000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/events/59731052/</event_url></item>
