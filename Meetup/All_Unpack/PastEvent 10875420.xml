So Liz and I thought it would be a nice place to have a doggie meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can go for a nice hike around the park and if the weather is good,  we can go back to the beach and have a cookout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woods and area around the lake are beautiful and offer plenty of places for the dogs to check out and explore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are not up for a big hike,  you can just do a shorter hike and hang out by the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's hot....it would be fun for the peeps to swim with the dogs !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a kayak,  canoe,  swimming bubbles or water toys....feel free to bring them.  The lake is beautiful and clean.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look and listen for the beagle screaming in the parking lot -  Over Heeeeeere !!!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judi-Judi-Judi</member_name><member_id>7477606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248306474000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247597941000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Clough State Park -  Hike and Swim this Sunday,  July 19th</name><id>10875420</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248026400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10875420/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/4/global_4051172.jpeg</photo_url></item>
