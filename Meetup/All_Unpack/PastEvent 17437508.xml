Walls, whose megaselling memoir, &lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt;,  recalled her own upbringing, writes in what she recalls as Lily's  plainspoken voice, whose recital provides plenty of drama and suspense  as she ricochets from one challenge to another. Having been educated in  fits and starts because of her parents' penury, Lily becomes a teacher  at age 15 in a remote frontier town she reaches after a solo 28-day  ride. Marriage to a bigamist almost saps her spirit, but later she weds a  rancher with whom she shares two children and a strain of plucky  resilience. (They sell bootleg liquor during Prohibition, hiding the  bottles under a baby's crib.) Lily is a spirited heroine, fiercely  outspoken against hypocrisy and prejudice, a rodeo rider and fearless  breaker of horses, and a ruthless poker player. Assailed by flash  floods, tornados and droughts, Lily never gets far from hardscrabble  drudgery in several states&amp;mdash;New Mexico, Arizona, Illinois&amp;mdash;but hers is one  of those heartwarming stories about indomitable women that will always  find an audience. &lt;em&gt;(Oct.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306508238000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>We read The Glass Castle...this is the next book that gives us an understanding of how Jeannette's mother was raised.
