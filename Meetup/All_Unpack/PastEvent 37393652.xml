&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cinestudio is thrilled to present the 17th film (including Eight Men Out, Passion Fish, and City of Hope) by director John Sayles. The New York Times describes Sayles as the &amp;ldquo;left-wing, baby-boom John Ford, spinning fables of the American character out of the threads of myth, memory and ideology,&amp;rdquo; - and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a greater compliment. Amigo takes place in the Philippines in 1900, as the U.S. army stages an invasion to liberate the local people from Spanish control - a war strongly criticized by Mark Twain. Veteran Philippine actor Joel Torre plays a mayor in the uncomfortable position of working with his American amigos (including Chris Cooper and Deadwood&amp;rsquo;s Garret Dillahunt); while protecting the rebel forces led by his brother. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the stuff I do being seen as widely as possible but I&amp;rsquo;m not interested enough to lie.&amp;rdquo; - John Sayles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319797255000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318611294000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet John Sayles at the film "Amigo"</name><id>37393652</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319670900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/37393652/</event_url></item>
