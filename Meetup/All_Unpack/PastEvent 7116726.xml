Post Mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early January, at the North Haven Barnes and Noble the group&lt;br /&gt;Had an hour and a half discussion around the New Age&lt;br /&gt;&amp;amp; Religion Books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group has asked that the next Coffee and a Movie&lt;br /&gt;Day go to the Milford Barnes and Noble.&lt;br /&gt;(I voted for the Milford Borders but was over voted.&lt;br /&gt;Borders have better tables and seating areas.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Milford B &amp;amp; N earlier on Monday (1/14).&lt;br /&gt;There were a couple of tables that fit four.  Four lounge chairs.   A couple of dozen&lt;br /&gt;Tables for two.  It will be harder to get tables in Milford than&lt;br /&gt;It was in North Haven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We waited around in North Haven B &amp;amp; N for around 20 minutes for tables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not plan on getting together around tables at the Milford B &amp;amp; N.&lt;br /&gt; We will be better off buying a coffee and &lt;br /&gt;Hanging out in corner of B &amp;amp; N before the Movie.&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, I am going to the Milford Borders&lt;br /&gt;For books, magazines and Seattles Best Coffee.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the group can go back to Milford&lt;br /&gt; B &amp;amp; N if they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information as we get closer to the date.&lt;br /&gt;We will send e-mail on the selection of movies around on that date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet by the Travel Books next to the Starbucks Lounge.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203446499000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Those who want to drink coffee around books and go to the movie.</why><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200364620000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Valentines Day Weekend Coffee and a Movie</name><id>7116726</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203273000000</time><rsvp_limit>45</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/coffee-397/events/7116726/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/5/global_2762549.jpeg</photo_url></item>
