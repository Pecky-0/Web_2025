She's unusual and I find her music rather addictive. From the Passim website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening to this 25-year-old singer/songwriter perform her meticulously written songs, fervently singing them in a distinctive, almost childlike voice, you'd think it was her life mission to rouse the hearts and minds of her listeners with an acoustic guitar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchell started writing songs at age 17 and eventually started performing them live during her school days, which were punctuated by a remarkable amount of traveling. In a short period of time, Anais made several trips to the Middle East, and also spent time in Europe and Latin America, studying languages and world politics. This stunning, troubadour-like experience seeped into her music, and she became adept at fusing her passion for literature and journalism in her lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concert is an alternative folk-opera based on the myth of Hades and Eurydice - I've seen it before - very different and interesting...I've already reserved a table for 4 and am bringing one friend so there are 2 spots available only. I already know that Francine is interested. If seats are gone already, please feel free to try to get a ticket on the Passim website. Nice vegetarian food is available to purchase (we are expected to eat at the tables - it's very reasonable) - wine and beer are also available. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271632140000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268612524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anais Mitchell concert at Passim</name><id>12876856</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271458800000</time><rsvp_limit>3</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/12876856/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/6/global_5526982.jpeg</photo_url></item>
