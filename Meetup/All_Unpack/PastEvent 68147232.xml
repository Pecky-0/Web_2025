&lt;p&gt;If you don't want to pay via paypal, get in touch with me to pay by check or cash -- I need a deposit to hold the date. I'm not offering an official refund policy since the seating is limited and there is a cost to attend. Use paypal or send a check to Alchemy Enterprises PO Box 30 Nahant MA&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mia</member_name><member_id>3507274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342349005000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Women Supporting Women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Women-Social-Network-Group</urlname><id>1379831</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Women Supporting Women Through Life's Incredible Journeys</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339075028000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Aroma Party in Salem (and dinner of course)</name><id>68147232</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342217700000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Women-Social-Network-Group/events/68147232/</event_url></item>
