Dr. Brook will be discussing Jihad versus the West.  I'll email members with details on cost of tickets as the date approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who should come? Are newcomers welcome?&lt;br /&gt;Anyone interested in Objectivism is welcome.  This will be a social gathering, not a study group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do members need to bring anything?&lt;br /&gt;An open and active mind is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should people come?&lt;br /&gt;It's a great opportunity to hear a fabulous speaker on a topic that many of us are not clear about due to the media's and the government's continual spin of the real story.  It's also a great opportunity to socialize with others interested in current events as viewed from an Objectivist perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will members find you when they get there?  I'll be wearing cowboy boots.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1161723719000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1159748390000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Evening With Dr. Yaron Brook at the Ford Hall Forum</name><id>5166002</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1161550800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/5166002/</event_url></item>
