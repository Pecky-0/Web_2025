Her fenced and shaded yard always manages to stay cool enough so that the Pugs can have a wonderful time!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it's true, most of the Pugs sit around in a circle next to the folding chairs and wait for food to drop...  but there is room to run.  If you have the kind of Pug that sits on the window sill keeping an eye out for burglars and runs back and forth on the back of the couch barking at nothing, this is the venue for you.  Your crazy Pug will sleep for hours when he gets home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of parking available.  Please bring folding chairs.  The group has grown big enough so that there probably won't be enough resident chairs to go around...    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluids will be provided, but now we are counting on our various meetup members to bring the goodies - since they've already been doing a bang up job of packing the table with tasty treats for Pugs and owners alike.   It isn't just the Pugs who stuff themselves at these meetups... your faithful organizer manages to go home with an extra pound or two on board every single time!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT FEED CLOVIS!  He has a damaged brain stem and has trouble swallowing.  Imagine a Pug who has trouble swallowing!  (Okay, you can feed him bits of soft food broken into tiny pieces... are you happy now, Clovis?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meetup is on the SECOND Sunday of August.  See you then!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the heat, 30 people showed up for the July 2007 meetup, and everyone, especially the Pugs, had a grand time!  Pug Charley attended his very first meetup - and met his prospective new owners for the first time as well.  He learned very quickly how to work the crowd for goodies.  He wasn't too sure he liked being dunked in the wading pool, however.   Sharon's huge yard remained cool enough, even in July, for the younger, more active Puggies to enjoy a game of fetch and to race around and around the yard.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most memorable moment was watching Jeter put his extraordinarily long tongue to good use when he couldn't stretch a paw far enough to reach the dog biscuits sitting on top of the table.  Undeterred, he rolled out that incredible tongue and snagged not just one, but two! biscuits! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to Sharon for making her home and her marvelous fenced yard available as a venue for our Sunday Pug socials.  I cannot imagine a better place!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful time was had by all, and we hope you will be able to attend the next meetup! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have! If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187115151000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183921524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug August Meetup</name><id>5992283</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186941600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5992283/</event_url></item>
