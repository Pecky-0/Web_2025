As a working team, Paul and Annie have racked up hundreds of thousands of miles on the road in the U.S. and Europe, performed on A Prairie Home Companion and Late Night With Conan O’Brien. They released I Want You To Know (1996), Moving To The Country (2000), the W.C. Handy Blues Award winner for Acoustic Blues Album of the Year, Goin’ Home (2004), and Dirt Road Blues (2008). Their first live album, A Night In Woodstock, was released October 21, 2008 and features special guests John Sebastian (harmonica), Bruce Katz (keyboards), Reed Butler (bass), Chris Rival (guitar), and Billy MacGillivray (drums) joining the duo for an eclectic, high-energy set of acoustic and electric originals and classic blues. In early 2009, A Night in Woodstock will be released as a DVD with extra songs and features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Raines is the perfect foil for Rishell...though they have chops to spare, they keep their playing straight and simple, going to the heart of the material...atmospheric late-night music, played with real grit and soul.&amp;quot; - BOSTON GLOBE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opener: TBA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$12 advance cash&lt;br /&gt;$16 day of show&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Serving the Tired, Thirsty Traveller since 1740&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Open 365 days a year&lt;br /&gt;215 Great Rd., PO Box 1228&lt;br /&gt;Rt. 2A, Shirley, MA 01464&lt;br /&gt;978-425-4311 or 877-536-7190 Toll Free&lt;br /&gt;FAX - 978-425-4314&lt;br /&gt;bullrun@bicnet.net&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask Delores.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>J.
