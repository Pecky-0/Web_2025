The cost to skate is only $7.00, and rental is FREE if you don't have your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you're a seasoned skater or a beginner, this is the perfect opportunity to have some fun, meet new people, and share some laughs. If anyone is interested, we can also grab some food either before or afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in the lobby at 12:45, which will give us time to chat and then hit the ice. If you get there later, my skates are blue. I have posted their website, which has directions, phone numbers, and lots of pictures of the rink. If you have any further questions, please call my cell phone at 860.227.7498&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you on the ice!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236551258000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232126635000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indoor Ice Skating</name><id>9537868</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232905500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/9537868/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/7/global_6951399.jpeg</photo_url></item>
