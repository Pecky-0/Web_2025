Afterwards, I would like to tour the Witch House, which is a historic home of one of the judges in the witch trials. There is a commuter rail that goes to Salem. If you are driving, note that I hear Salem is crowded the whole month of October so allow extra time for traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the exhibit: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Museum admission is $15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pem.org/exhibitions/109-the_emperors_private_paradise_treasures_from_the_forbidden_city" target="_blank"&gt;http://pem.org/exhibi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before seen by the public, the contents of an Emperor’s private retreat deep within the Forbidden City will be revealed for the first time at the Peabody Essex Museum.&lt;br /&gt;An 18th-century compound in a hidden quadrant of the immense imperial complex, the Qianlong Garden (also known as the Tranquility and Longevity Palace Garden), is part of a decade-long, multimillion-dollar conservation initiative undertaken by the World Monuments Fund in partnership with the Palace Museum, Beijing.&lt;br /&gt;Ninety objects of ceremony and leisure — murals, paintings, wall coverings, furniture, architectural elements, jades and cloisonné — unveil the private realm of the Qianlong Emperor (r.1736-1796), one of history’s most influential figures. In his time, he was among the richest, most powerful men in the world. A connoisseur, scholar and devout Buddhist, he created a luxurious garden compound to serve throughout his retirement as a secluded place of contemplation, repose and entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Witch House:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jonathan Corwin House&lt;br /&gt;also known as&lt;br /&gt;The Witch House &lt;br /&gt;310 1/2 Essex Street, Salem, Massachusetts 01970&lt;br /&gt;phone (978) 744-8815 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.salemweb.com/witchhouse/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.salemweb.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guided tours: $10.25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Witch House, home of Judge Jonathan Corwin, is the only structure still standing in Salem with direct ties to the Witchcraft Trials of 1692. As a local magistrate and civic leader, Corwin was called upon to investigate the claims of diabolical activity when a surge of witchcraft accusations arose in Salem and neighboring communities. He served on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which ultimately sent nineteen to the gallows. All nineteen refused to admit to witchcraft and maintained their innocence.    &lt;br /&gt;The house is an excellent example of seventeenth-century architecture. Judge Corwin, buried in the nearby Broad Street Cemetery, purchased the structure in 1675 when he was 24 years old and lived there for more than forty years. The house remained in the Corwin family until the mid-1800's. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1944, the threatened destruction of The Witch House became the catalyst that launched a new wave of restoration in Salem. A group of concerned citizens raised the $42,500 needed to move and restore the building. The new museum officially opened to the public in 1948. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Witch House tours blend information about seventeenth-century lifestyles, furnishings, and architecture with fascinating insights into the events of 1692. Visitors gain a deeper comprehension of the lives of those involved in the Witchcraft Trials through examination of the material culture of the period. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture and will wear a Meetup button, will be near the entrance at 10 am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anna</member_name><member_id>404606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288406790000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281710152000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Treasures from the Forbidden City at the PEM/Witch House (historic house)</name><id>14412068</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287237600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14412068/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/7/global_17148567.jpeg</photo_url></item>
