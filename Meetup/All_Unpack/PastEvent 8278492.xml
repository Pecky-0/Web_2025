A Spoon fell on his head.&lt;br /&gt;The waitress thanked Ruth for her support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cosmicsociety.com/carouselmeeting.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cosmicsoci...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.cosmicsociety.com/carouselmeeting.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/phaunt2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.100megsfre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/phaunt2.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IhOaKHzVKgYC&amp;amp;pg=PA6&amp;amp;lpg=PA6&amp;amp;dq=carousel+gardens+ruth&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=_ZreucZXtC&amp;amp;sig=ddn6oO4Z-Ijhg12W0hkk-P93fis#PPA6,M1" target="_blank"&gt;http://books.google.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;books.google.com/books?id=IhOaKHzVKgYC&amp;amp;pg=PA6&amp;amp;lpg=PA6&amp;amp;dq=carousel+gardens+ruth&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=_ZreucZXtC&amp;amp;sig=ddn6oO4Z-Ijhg12W0hkk-P93fis#PPA6,M1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is there when the doors open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We might add more information as we get closer to the event date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just off Rt 67.   Coming from West Haven / New Haven, I really&lt;br /&gt;Did not see the sign.  I had to go beyond Rt. 8 and turn around&lt;br /&gt;in a McDonalds (after getting a coffee)  and&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the huge CGR sign.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is on North Street, but I could not&lt;br /&gt;Find a North Street sign any where at that intersection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe where it is...&lt;br /&gt;On Rt 67, when you get into Seymour, look for an intersection&lt;br /&gt;That has a Gulf Gas Station, Village View Pizza Restaurant, &lt;br /&gt;Exxon Gas Station and Citgo Gas Station.&lt;br /&gt;CGR is up a hill right behind the Gulf Gas Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall cancel and reschedule this Meet Up if there is any&lt;br /&gt;Adverse weather that might affect the driving conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Rt 67 is full of dangerous curves during normal &lt;br /&gt;Driving Conditions.  &lt;br /&gt;Rt 34 to 115 to 67 was a little less risky than Rt 67.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B.&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;Greater New Haven Unknown Zone&lt;br /&gt;Organizer of Coffee Talk&lt;br /&gt;Organizer of Karaoke Lovers&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be over by the bar 15 minutes before the Meet Up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219176716000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Conspiracists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>conspiracy-83</urlname><id>648888</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Greater New Haven Unknown Zone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215215379000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at a Ghostly Seymour Restaurant on 8/17</name><id>8278492</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219003200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/conspiracy-83/events/8278492/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/f/f/global_2489375.jpeg</photo_url></item>
