I was going to head out and do some exploring this weekend, and figured I'd send out an invite to any that would like to come. This will be my second time out there, so expect to get lost. A lot. At least if I'm leading and you've never been out there. LOL, but isn't that half the fun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an intermediate ride, mostly trail riding (Read: no big drops) I'm just stepping up to clipless pedals (long time platformer), so I plan on taking it on the easy side. Well, at least when stopping. Speaking of stopping, I plan on riding through until 1-3. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your eye on the weather, there is a storm passing by late this week. From what I hear, that means a lot of mud, as this area floods easily. I'm also breaking in a new bike, so I'm going to avoid riding it into ponds or lakes.   &lt;a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/01757" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.weather.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail Map:  &lt;a href="http://www.bvnemba.org/images/vietnam_map_1173_x_2244.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bvnemba.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've added a new venue that takes you to an alternate parking lot that allows you to take Upper Charles Trail right to where exit 20 crosses under 495. The only time you'll need to cross traffic is getting across Rt 85. Note that to get here you turn right on Dilla (by Wendy's - Although from what I hear, most people just park in the very back of the parking lots behind Wendy's and other businesses).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in a Dk Grey Tacoma</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff H</member_name><member_id>12630752</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286554447000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mountain Bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mountainbikes-102</urlname><id>485750</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>New England MTB Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285721907000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Exploring Vietnam...</name><id>14932133</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286029800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mountainbikes-102/events/14932133/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/1/global_7101473.jpeg</photo_url></item>
