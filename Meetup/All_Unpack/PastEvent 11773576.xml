Katherine Jefferts Schori, Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church (United States and 15 other nations) and Ph.D. in oceanography&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Dr. David Urion, Associate Professor of Neurology and Director of the Division of Service Learning, Harvard Medical School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Join us for a fascinating panel discussion on the social responsibility of the scientist as we celebrate TAC's 45th anniversary&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be outside Building 10, Room 250 holding up a red MEETUP sign. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. He'll be there by 6:30 pm. Let's grab seats at 6:40 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Care to grab something to eat beforehand? Meet T.J. at the Food Court next to the Kendall / MIT subways stop, Marriott Hotel side. He'll place a few MEETUP table tents on the tables. We can head to Building 10 at 6:15 pm. It looks like we walk from the T station to Ames Street, take a left on Ames Street, take a right between Building 66 and Building 64, continue straight to Building 8. Then we enter Building 8, make a wrong turn on Building 4 and get hopelessly lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About George Daley&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/cfapps/research/data_admin/Site92/mainpageS92P0.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.childrensh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Dr. Daley received a PhD in biology from MIT and an MD degree from Harvard Medical School through the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;He has been elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and has received research awards from Harvard Medical School, the National Institutes of Health, the New England Cancer Society, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. Foundation, and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] George Daley's work focuses on embryonic stem (ES) cells, which have the potential to differentiate into all other cell types. More specifically, his lab is investigating: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;* The differentiation of hematopoietic (blood producing) stem cells from embryonic cells. Daley and colleagues study hematopoietic development in mouse embryos and in human and mouse ES cells in order to define the molecular genetic programs that enable formation of HSCs in experimental and therapeutic models. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;* Self-renewal and differentiation of human ES cells. The lab is using expression cloning together with genomic and proteomic strategies to identify factors that specify human ES cell self-renewal and differentiation. They are building tools for gene expression and gene knock-down in human ES cells to facilitate experimental and therapeutic studies&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Technology and Culture Forum at MIT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/tac/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.mit.edu/ta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Technology shapes the modern world and MIT is a world leader in shaping technology. It is imperative that MIT students, faculty, and staff, not only engage in, but lead the dialogue about the potential change. For forty years, the Technology and Culture Forum has provided the only on-going, Institute-wide arena for such issues to be discussed&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
