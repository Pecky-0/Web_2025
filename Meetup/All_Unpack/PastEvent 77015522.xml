Perhaps this is because it is so often used as an add-on to other desserts. Let's get together and taste-test several popular and lesser-known varieties of vanilla ice cream. We can share our findings and try to identify the brands while cooling off from the inside out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream, tasting implements and information, and palate cleansers will be provided. We will also have some accompaniments (i.e. fruit, topping, brownies, etc. Additional contributions would be much appreciated but please touch base with me first to avoid duplication.) If anyone wishes to bring homemade vanilla ice cream, please contact me so it can be appropriately camouflaged. (This is a blind tasting).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346250125000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344522012000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A cool idea: Ice Cream Tasting</name><id>77015522</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345399200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/77015522/</event_url></item>
