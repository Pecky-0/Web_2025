Although we talk business at them for half an hour and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, tell your own stories, etc.  They're so we can all have a little no-pressure time as a group, and it helps us all by reminding each other that this stuff might be more than TV and book fodder, but real events happening to real individuals.&lt;br /&gt;The private back room also has a projector on the ceiling that can be used for evidence clips.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Asia has a decent buffet going til 8:00 - $12 per person - or choose something from their most excellent menu. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We usually sit at a table in the back private room.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlie</member_name><member_id>6000445</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307640375000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245972711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group July Meetup</name><id>10737316</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248388200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/10737316/</event_url></item>
