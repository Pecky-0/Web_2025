I just spoke to the director at Windblown and they have 5 inches of cover, so they will have everything open except the steep stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windblown is the ultimate New England cross country ski experience with a wonderful lodge, bring your lunch or buy it there (I'm pretty sure they will have the cafe fully open but call to be sure if you are not bringing lunch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All abilities are welcome, we break up into groups based on experience and ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start at 10 AM, just outside the lodge at the ski rack ready to ski, sorry we cannot wait for you but it is cold and we need to get moving to stay warm! Arrive early so you can buy your trail pass and get ready to ski before we meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow at least 1.5 hours driving time from the Boston area. Trail passes are $16--CASH OR CHECK ONLY!!! Rentals available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact each other for carpooling! Use the discussion board!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326716668000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326389794000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Windblown Sunday!</name><id>47825022</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326639600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/47825022/</event_url></item>
