Maybe we should do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Chef was giving a waitress a hard time.  A Spoon fell on his head.&lt;br /&gt;The waitress thanked Ruth for her support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cosmicsociety.com/carouselmeeting.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cosmicsoci...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.cosmicsociety.com/carouselmeeting.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/phaunt2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.100megsfre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/phaunt2.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IhOaKHzVKgYC&amp;amp;pg=PA6&amp;amp;lpg=PA6&amp;amp;dq=carousel+gardens+ruth&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=" target="_blank"&gt;http://books.google.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_ZreucZXtC&amp;amp;sig=ddn6oO4Z-Ijhg12W0hkk-P93fis#PPA6,M1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;books.google.com/books?id=IhOaKHzVKgYC&amp;amp;pg=PA6&amp;amp;lpg=PA6&amp;amp;dq=&lt;br /&gt;carousel+gardens+ruth&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=&lt;br /&gt;_ZreucZXtC&amp;amp;sig=ddn6oO4Z-Ijhg12W0hkk-P93fis#PPA6,M1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open when no one is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your camera to this Coffee Talk and maybe spectral energy Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can get photos of at least orbs, if not even more energy forms.&lt;br /&gt;The Carousel Gardens websites has photos of orbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybes will be allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a joint Coffee Talk and Unknown Zone Meet Up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our members might want to come here on their&lt;br /&gt;Own for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fridays for Karaoke&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that some Coffee Talk members have&lt;br /&gt;Been going there on their own for Karaoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Wednesdays of the month for the Cosmic Society s&lt;br /&gt;Ghost Hunter Meeting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychic Fairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We might add more information as we get closer to the event date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday, January 21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Carousel Gardens to reserve a Private Room&lt;br /&gt;For 2:00 to 5:00 on Sunday March 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have asked Tony Diana of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.necromare.net/insight2.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.necromare....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.necromare.net/insight2.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he could give a lecture on his paranormal&lt;br /&gt;Investigations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony has agreed with my request for him to give a paranormal&lt;br /&gt;Lecture during our Carousel Gardens Meet Up.  This does depend &lt;br /&gt;On whether or not some thing else, such as a case, does&lt;br /&gt;Not come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is bad weather, since it does snow in March, then I shall cancel and&lt;br /&gt;Reschedule this Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP Yes, Maybe or No for this Meet Up Event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reserved and left a deposit for the room for&lt;br /&gt;The March 9th Meet Up earlier tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The room is reserved for 12 to 16 people, but I said that more &lt;br /&gt;People than that might come.  It is too early to &lt;br /&gt;Give a definite count.  I can ask for more people closer to the&lt;br /&gt;Time of the Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just off Rt 67.   Coming from West Haven / New Haven, I really&lt;br /&gt;Did not see the sign.  I had to go beyond Rt. 8 and turn around&lt;br /&gt;in a McDonalds (after getting a coffee)  and&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the huge CGR sign.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is on North Street, but I could not&lt;br /&gt;Find a North Street sign any where at that intersection.&lt;br /&gt;I got it, the specter energy keeps taking the street sign?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, more than likely local kids took it down and the&lt;br /&gt;State is slow in putting one back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe where it is...&lt;br /&gt;On Rt 67, when you get into Seymour, look for an intersection&lt;br /&gt;That has a Gulf Gas Station, Village View Pizza Restaurant, &lt;br /&gt;Exxon Gas Station and Citgo Gas Station.&lt;br /&gt;CGR is up a hill right behind the Gulf Gas Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, Feb. 19&lt;br /&gt;Ghost Investigator Tony Diana and his sister, Psychic&lt;br /&gt;Medium Angelina Diana have confirmed that they&lt;br /&gt;Are both attending this Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;Angelina might be doing randon psychic readings&lt;br /&gt;At this Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know more about Angelina, then&lt;br /&gt;Her Meet Up link is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://psychics.meetup.com/273/"&gt;http://psychics.meetu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;psychics.meetup.com/273/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.angelinadiana.com/"&gt;http://www.angelinadi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.angelinadiana.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kiss957.com/pages/jox/kitm_angelina.html"&gt;http://www.kiss957.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.kiss957.com/pages/jox/kitm_angelina.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B.&lt;br /&gt;Coffee Talk Assistant Organizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greater New Haven Unknown Zone Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have a Private Room reserved in my name.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205271210000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>You will be sharing a hot drink with Paranormal/Ghost Investigators</why><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197826180000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coffee in a Ghostly Seymour Restaurant</name><id>6921752</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205085600000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/coffee-397/events/6921752/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/e/global_2654830.jpeg</photo_url></item>
