It&amp;rsquo;s a cozy place to spend a wintry Sunday afternoon, balanced by the energy soccer fans bring whenever they tune into a game. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008080"&gt;We also want to give the NHC the chance to say goodbye to one of our gems, Janel.  She&amp;rsquo;s leaving us for the sandy shores of Hawaii next week (and yes, she came to this decision before the forty days and nights of winter that&amp;rsquo;s snowed down upon us).  She has been an active member for years, and she will be sorely missed.  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t met her, Janel is one of the few people who combine fairy dust, a cat&amp;rsquo;s sense of mischief, sunshine, sharp wit, and the no-nonsense attitude of the former Marine that she is. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Please come out on Sunday to &lt;a href="http://www.livesoccertv.com/schedules/2011-01-23/" target="_blank"&gt;watch some good games&lt;/a&gt;, and to hang out with Janel and Co : )  If you're only a Maybe please put this in your comment. when you RSVP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008080"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008080"&gt;Personal note from Devorah &amp;ndash; I wrote the above write-up (I didn&amp;rsquo;t want you to think she wrote it about herself!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
