Perfect Harmony exposes the cut-throat competition of glee clubs and the even more cut-throat competition of high school. The show premiered to raves at the 2006 NY Fringe Festival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated PG-13: contains mild profanity, irreverent humor, and excessive use of 80's pop songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://stonehamtheatr.." target="_blank"&gt;http://stonehamtheatr...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AN OPTIONAL DINNER BEFORE THE SHOW WILL BE POSTED AS A SEPARATE MEETUP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is also posted with: Meeting &amp;amp; Greeting in Southern NH &amp;amp; the Merrimack Valley, Northern Middlesex Singles, and The Boston Providence Single Parents Group.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at our seats so folks can enjoy the pre-show choral group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jill</member_name><member_id>3473807</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285533681000</updated><rating><average>3.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
