As you stand on the bald, rocky ridge, you can see Sleeping Giant to the south, and Castle Craig a short distance away on the same ridgeline.  It's a nice place to take a break, especially after humping it up the mountain.  That'll be the main destination for the hike, but the ridge extends north along a lesser-trod trail, and we'll continue along that way for a while before doing an about face and turning back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike should take 3 to 4 hours walking at a normal pace, and has enough up that we'll be resting a few times before reaching the peak.  Our ascent will start at the footbridge crossing I-691, and our descent will differ in that we'll come down the non-steep way near the pavillion under Castle Craig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group will meet at 10am on Saturday in the parking lot by the playground, and leave when everyone has arrived (or when 10:15am has come).  We should be back at the parking lot by 2pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/OneClickDirections.aspx?mkt=en-us&amp;amp;rtp=~pos.qxrdxb8xxm1p&amp;amp;FORM=LLMP" target="_blank"&gt;Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring water,  a snack, and appropriate footwear.
