Only one of our selectman had the courage to refuse to sign the proclamation. I have recieved a copy of the proclamation and would like to have it there so we can show the public what we think of it. Please bring your flags and lots of handouts about Agenda 21 and the UN. Let's get in the socialists faces and educate them as only we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of you have any ideas as to how we can make this a really big event and bring lots of attention to this issue, please contact me. I am open to all suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it might be a good idea to have a few of these in different locations. Let's get our old RRR team going again!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351119921000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1690</urlname><id>950430</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351011422000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ANTI UN/AGENDA 21 RALLY</name><id>88225032</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351108800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1690/events/88225032/</event_url></item>
