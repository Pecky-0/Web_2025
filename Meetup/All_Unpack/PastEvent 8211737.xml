Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've heard Razzy's is awesomely divey and fun, with cheap beers, good grub, and a townie crowd.  I've never &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; trivia myself but I think it would be cool to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan on getting there between 7 and 8PM - trivia doesn't start until 9PM, but that way, we'll make sure we're in the building and we've got seats.  I've heard it can get crowded.  I'll be there at 7PM getting my drink on. :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be somewhere - send out my cell if ya'll need it.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217908163000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214404267000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ Razzy's</name><id>8211737</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217545200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/8211737/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/7/global_4580567.jpeg</photo_url></item>
