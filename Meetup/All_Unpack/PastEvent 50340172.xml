&lt;p&gt;If you want to give this a try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call Crab Apple 1-800-553-7238 and tell then you want Monroe Bridge Sunday&amp;nbsp;June 24, 2012.&amp;nbsp; You would like to&amp;nbsp;be in&amp;nbsp;Timo's (another hiking group member)&amp;nbsp;boat and you are from Hartford Area Hiking Meetup Group.&amp;nbsp; The cost is going to be $95 per person.&amp;nbsp; You will need to pay for this over the phone when you make the reservation. This is a special for that day.&amp;nbsp; If you do not request Timo and the hiking group you will be put with other folks in a random boat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to go and respond, I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have.&amp;nbsp; Monroe Bridge is not a beginners trip.&amp;nbsp; You need to be in good physical health.&amp;nbsp; Its got some class III and IV to handle, but it is super fun.&amp;nbsp; If there is an interest in the slower paced trip, I will be more than happy to post a trip on that stretch called Fife Brook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Summer!&amp;nbsp; The photo is from the June 12, 2011&amp;nbsp;trip and I&amp;nbsp;the one in the back right&amp;nbsp;screaming like a crazy person.......&lt;/p&gt;
