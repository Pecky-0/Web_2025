<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We live on the northshore and it's not easily accessible by T. There is a bus that runs once an hour from Wonderland Station if you're that intrepid! Let me know if you need MBTA directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a household with birds and a rabbit for those who may have allergies to fur, feathers, aspen shavings, and/or hay dust. The birds will be in a different room but the rabbit will not. She may even come out and greet everyone like last time since that went well. There is on street parking available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to bring a snack to share, that would be much appreciated but not required. We will have some sort of meal items for dinnertime, depending on what our CSA gives us. &amp;nbsp;If it's not enough we are close to several restaurants with reasonably priced food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In addition to boardgames,if there is interest,&amp;nbsp;we can play party games on the Wii or PS3 like Mario Kart, Mario Party, Rayman Raving Rabid&lt;/em&gt;s, Fat Princess, etc. Nothing like trying to see who can throw Bessie the cow the furthest or trying to run Becki off the road!! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;End time for this is Sunday, 11:00 pm.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Address will be emailed to those attending as of Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>665322</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kieran</member_name><member_id>6071263</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1315231159000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1310512307000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play games at Josh and Kieran's House, II</name><id>25521341</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315155600000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/25521341/</event_url></item>
