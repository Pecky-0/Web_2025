This state park is along the Hudson River in Rockland County, NY. Carpool leaves 7 AM, E. Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please pack a hearty trail lunch and a quart of water for this trip. Hiking boots are required as well as warm layered clothing so layers can be removed as you warm up on the hike. A pack is strongly advised to store your lunch and layers removed. Your hands need to be free for the hike. Carpool (limited capacity) from Hartford area leaves 7 AM, group for hike meets at park at 9:30 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view is dramatic starting with the Hudson River valley as we approach the park. The valley is a fjord at this point, deepened by glaciers long ago. The mountains on either side of the river are over 1,000 feet in altitude and they rise about that much above the river. We cross Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson with our vehicles and the view is wonderful up and down the valley from such a high path. We'll park at the Bear Mountain Inn (closed for renovation though) and wait for the gathering of hike participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll hike a small portion of the Appalachian Trail from the Inn up to the peak of Bear Mtn. The gain in altitude is roughly a respectable 1,100 feet in 1.75 miles of hiking. Generous time has been allotted for the ascent (up to 2 hours) and it is not recommended for those with heart or breathing issues. At the peak we'll temporarily pass the Perkins Memorial Tower to reach the true peak of the mountain a little further on. We then backtrack to eat our packed in lunch at a picnic area. After lunch we backtrack a little more to the tower to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then start out decent, still on the Appalachian Trail until we intersect with a Red blazed trail in a small valley and start heading southeast. We'll intersect a Yellow blazed trail and take that around a swampy area and up a couple hundred feet on a shoulder of Bear Mountain as we make our way northeast. Once over the shoulder we descend and intersect a portion of the Appalachian Trail we used for the ascent and return to the Inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many interesting amenities and views in the area of the Inn we'll have about an hour of free time to check out (see below). We will stop to get something to eat after the hike on the way hime. Please bring enough cash to facilitate paying the check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you carpool, please chip in a fair share for the ride. Parking fee, if in effect, is $6/car. Bridge toll to leave the park (to east) is $1/car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;+ 1,100 ft total gain in altitude to peek (160 ft at start - 1,284 feet at peak).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 7:00 AM Carpool leaves E.
