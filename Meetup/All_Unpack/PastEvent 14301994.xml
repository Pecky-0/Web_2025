A Dallas native, Washington attends Berklee as a recipient of the prestigious Bill Cosby Presidential Scholarship. She is a former member of the Ralph Peterson Ensemble as well as the Gibson/Baldwin Jazz Ensemble, which performs at Grammy events. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washington has worked with Herb Alpert, Destiny's Child, and Terence Blanchard, and has recorded jingles and commercials for Frito Lay and McDonalds. Down Beat magazine twice chose her as Best Jazz Vocalist, Performing Arts High School Division. She attended the Brubeck Institute Summer Jazz Colony in 2005 and 2006. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With plans that include a live recording and touring overseas, Washington is well on her way to becoming a musical pioneer of today's generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to create your route by public transit.
