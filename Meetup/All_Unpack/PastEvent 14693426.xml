No time for extra-curricular coffee?? Shame sir, for shame...), I am going to go with having this at Coffee Exchange again. If the weather is nice we can sit out on the deck, if not, inside is also nice. And if some of us want we can take a stroll down Wickenden Street afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and join us for Skeptics in the Coffee Shop! A place where like-minded skeptics can meet and converse in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Take advantage of these meetings to discuss what skepticism is, what's fun about it, and what areas of the modern Skeptical movement are of most interest to you. The skeptical spectrum runs the gamut: from very deeply serious philosophical issues (like the anti-vaccination movement and creationists) to the, er - 'lighter' or 'fluffy' issues (like Nessie or big foot). So brush up on your favorite skeptical topic, bring your favorite skeptical books and URLs and prepare to share what ticks you off or tickles you the most about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to do these meetings twice a month - one on a Thursday evening and one on Sunday afternoon. It won't always be at the same coffee shop - at least at first, but I'd like to keep it all loose and open to suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COFFEE EXCHANGE &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=4010063472820041372&amp;amp;q=providence+cafes&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;cd=74&amp;amp;cad=src:pplink,view:text&amp;amp;ei=4Yt0TMuhBZX6tgO8_IibAw&amp;amp;sig2=npaQN6GZkwMceyQZHHePow" target="_blank"&gt;IS HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Facebook page &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#!/pages/The-Rhode-Island-Skeptics-Society/100687263306206" target="_blank"&gt;can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will have a laptop opened with the RI Skeptics Facebook logo on it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>paul ruggeri</member_name><member_id>6360030</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284927665000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Skeptics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>skeptics-133</urlname><id>357970</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Skeptics Society</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283916466000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skeptics in the Coffee Shop</name><id>14693426</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284922800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/skeptics-133/events/14693426/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/3/d/global_1347901.jpeg</photo_url></item>
