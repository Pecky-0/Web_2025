A 2-3 mile hike at the Belding Trout Management Area in Vernon. This hour long hike is very pleasent and is great for beginners and is scenic enough with the forest, stream, and dammed pond to interest more advanced hikers. This area is a hidden gem and even connects to Valley Falls, the Hop River Linear Trail, the Schinipsit Trail, and some Northern Connecticut Land trust property! How's that for location? Dogs and kids welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the 7-11 on Route 30 in Vernon at 2:30PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for the Hartford area: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I-84 to Exit 66&lt;br /&gt;* Turn left off the exit and left again at the light. &lt;br /&gt;* Cross over the highway and at the next light, turn right onto Route 30 East. &lt;br /&gt;* Follow Route 30 East to the 7-11 on the left (meet-up location).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader will be Gloria (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/1099810/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) at (860) 306-5349.
