Meet at the Fort Hill St gate, the entrance road is across from the Hingham commuter train station, keep going until you come to the parking lot. Don't forget that dogs now have to be leashed in the parking lot and for the first few hundred feet into the park. The trails are wide and flat and it is an easy 3.5 mile walk. The dogs can go for a swim. Bring water, plastic bags and perhaps a doggie towel. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Carolyn will be waiting inside the gate past the parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carolyn</member_name><member_id>11484647</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283005207000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282574334000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of August at Bare Cove</name><id>14511019</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283000400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/14511019/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/9/global_13435449.jpeg</photo_url></item>
