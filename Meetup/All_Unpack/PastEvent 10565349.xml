Last year, the Newcomers went to see Joel McHale as part of the Newport Comedy Festival - this year we will go see Tracy Morgan [cast member of Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock]!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will most likely carpool to save costs on parking in downtown Newport. Last year, we also went out to dinner beforehand. If you are interested in doing either of these, please indicate so on your RSVP. I probably won't go out afterwards since it's a Sunday night, but you are more than welcome to stay in Newport. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $35 and $5.90 for the convenience charge. Please give cash / check to me by July 9th [one month before the performance] so I can order the tickets far enough in advance that our group can sit together. &lt;b&gt;If you cannot make it after I've purchased tickets, it's your responsibility to find a replacement.&lt;/b&gt; I cannot give refunds after the tickets have been purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the festival: &lt;a href="http://www.newportcomedy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newportcom...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fore more information on Tracy Morgan: &lt;a href="http://www.tracymorgan.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tracymorga...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>TBD</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1250118296000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244041217000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tracy Morgan @ Newport Comedy Festival </name><id>10565349</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249858800000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/10565349/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
