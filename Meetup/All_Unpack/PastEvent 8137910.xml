If you haven't ventured south to see this evening festival of fire, water, food and music, it is definitely an experience to be had.  Sadly, there aren't many lightings this year, so we're getting on in early.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the details at &lt;a href="http://www.waterfire.org/about-waterfire/welcome" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.waterfire....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For directions and parking: &lt;a href="http://www.waterfire.org/plan-your-trip/parking-and-directions" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.waterfire....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be posting a limited RSVP dinner before hand as a separate event, but there are a ton of restaurants and places to catch dinner beforehand if the numbers fill too quickly.  Save room though (this isn't Fire and Ice time) as there are typically yummy treats to be purchased along the way :-)  There are a bunch of restaurants (above and beyond the food court) along Providence Place associated with the mall and many more in the area.  Details on eating spots available on the Waterfire website under &amp;quot;planning your trip&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no limit to the RSVPs for this one, but as this can be a very crowded public event, we may divide and conquer the waterway.  And to keep track of folks, any Maybes will be changed to No's the day prior to the event.  You're still free to join us at 8, but we won't wait for ya if you're late:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet outside of the entrance to Providence Place Mall closest to Joe's American Bar (where we'll be eating) between 8:00-8:15 p.m.  It is a fairly convenient place to park, and right across from the Providence River Basin, the &amp;quot;end&amp;quot; of the walk.   The fires light up at sunset which is &amp;quot;Scheduled&amp;quot; for 8:24 p.m.  &lt;br /&gt;Will send my cell number out to the yes's closer to the day so we'll be certain to find each other.  It usually runs until 11 or later, but, as is the nature of any street festival, you can come and go when you please. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to it!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa/vetchick</member_name><member_id>4120480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214265932000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213385374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterfire Providence</name><id>8137910</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214092800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/8137910/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/2/global_2186386.jpeg</photo_url></item>
