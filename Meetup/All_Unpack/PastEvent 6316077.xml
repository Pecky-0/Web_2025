Meet at 11am.  Bring ropes and slings if you have them. You should know how to belay and have a harness with a carabiner and belay device.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a helmet if you have one. We are not responsible for injuries. &lt;br /&gt;Also, there are no facilities. Bring water, food, sunscreen, camera, etc.  Roger wants to drink beer AFTER the rock climbing.  Bring a frisbee &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you come late (like me), you will have to walk around and ask for the Rock Climbing Boston Meetup.  If you come on time you will have to walk around and ask for the Rock Climbing Boston Meetup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weather looks really bad Roger will climb by himself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  &lt;br /&gt;The Quincy Quarries Reservation is part of the Blue Hills Reservation, south of Boston. Take Route 93/3 to exit 8 in Quincy. Follow signs for Quarry Hills Recreation Complex until you come to Ricciuti Drive, between a Mr. Tux and a large Quarry Hills sign. It's quick going south, but a bit roundabout going north. Turn right on Ricciuti Drive. There is a small parking lot on your right (which is usually full and you will most likely see a line of cars on the opposite side of road where you can park).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya,  &lt;br /&gt;Geoff  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189436728000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189193656000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>QQ Rock Climbing with Roger</name><id>6316077</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189263600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/6316077/</event_url></item>
