<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Elm Bank Reservation, located in Wellesley, is one of the most recent parkland acquisitions. The 182 acres of woodlands, fields, and old estate property is surrounded on three sides by the Charles River. The reservation is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its many elements of estate landscaping. A variety of wildlife, including deer, thrive in the upland habitats and along the river. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elm Bank Reservation is the home of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, so there may be signs for either or both. The Horticultural Society seems to have several formal gardens in Elm Bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Car:&lt;br /&gt;Route 9 to Route 16. Follow Route 16 (Washington Street) through Wellesley. Adjacent to railroad tracks and near the intersection of Washington Street and Forest Street, the entrance to Elm Bank is 1 mile past Wellesley College. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/elmbank.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.masshort.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.masshort.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the parking lot outside the Horticultural Society HQ</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238262125000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235858630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Elm Bank Reservation and the Massachusetts Horticultural Society walk</name><id>9846925</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237741200000</time><rsvp_limit>31</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9846925/</event_url></item>
