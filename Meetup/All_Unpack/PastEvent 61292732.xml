It is non contact, similar to touch rugby and a great way to keep fit during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We play every Sunday morning with a very friendly, welcoming group of people, mainly expats from a variety of different rugby playing nations (Irish, French, Aussies and Kiwis). The standard is good for a social game and people of all skill levels are welcome to come along and give it a try. Once the evenings get a little longer we also have training on Thursday nights in Brookline near Coolidge Corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to join please RSVP to this event so that we know you are coming and I will get the organisers to add you to the mailing list for future games. If you have any problems you can call me on 617 863 7390&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337653161000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334864796000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Social tag rubgy</name><id>61292732</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335103200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/61292732/</event_url></item>
