Ted Leo and Pharmacists will be performing at the Roxy on Saturday, December 1st at  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:30PM. It looks like it is going to be an early show. I have actually never been to the Roxy so i'm not sure what is around  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the area for good bars or restaurants. I was thinking that we could meetup outside the show and grab a drink after the show  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at a bar in the area. I've randomly chosen Bishop's Pub, which is located near the Boylston stop on the Green line and a  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;short walk to Park Street as well. If any of you have any suggestions for somewhere to meetup after, let me know. It will be  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a great show.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't listened to Ted Leo, here is a link to his myspace page &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/tedleo" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the show &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Moeri</member_name><member_id>4913745</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542667000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196039352000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ted Leo - Roxy - December 1st</name><id>6802275</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196551800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/6802275/</event_url></item>
