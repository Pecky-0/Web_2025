The camp is run by &lt;a href="http://www.surfershealing.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Surfers Healing&lt;/a&gt;, a donor-supported foundation for autism based in San Juan Capistrano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surfers Healing was started by Israel and Danielle Paskowitz when their son, Isaiah, was diagnosed with autism.  Israel, a former competitive surfer, found that surfing simply transformed his son and others with autism, helping them cope with sensory inputs that were usually overwhelming.  The Providence Journal, reporting on &lt;a href="http://www.projo.com/news/content/surfers_camp_09-20-09_D1FPHLJ_v17.345ffa1.html" target="_blank"&gt;last year's surfer's camp&lt;/a&gt;, noted that parents found the effect to be &amp;quot;remarkable, even magical&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on out to have a good time and hear some great music while supporting a great cause.
