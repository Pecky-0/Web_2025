It is possible that we will judge it to be worse than the other venues used by us so far, and we may simply walk over to one of those other locations and have our meeting there. Therefore if you do not find us at UNO's by 7:15pm then that's what happened and we will be at Rendang again.&lt;br /&gt;Rendang&lt;br /&gt;57 JF Kennedy St Cambridge, MA&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge MA 02138&lt;br /&gt;617-234-3988&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will continue with the objections and replies to Descartes' Meditations On First Philosophy pp. 121 through pp 179. (As usual by now the page numbers refer to: The Philosophical Writings of Descartes Translated by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff and Dugald Murdoch, ISBN:052128807 for Vol I and ISBN:052128808 for Vol II)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182035373000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1180215121000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Descartes: Mediations; 3rd and 4th set of objections and replies</name><id>5821779</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181862000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5821779/</event_url></item>
