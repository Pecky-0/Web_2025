For those of you who haven't met Florian, he lived in New Haven for a year on work study and was a very active member of the NHC. He was a regular at Monday HHs, on the softball team and took lots of shopping trips with us to the outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's visiting from Germany with his girlfriend Melanie in 12/29 and wants to meet up with anyone around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you knew him from early on, come on out and say hi. If you never met him before, come on out and say hi!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Robyn-Allise 203-823-5302&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262306070000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262002176000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet Florian</name><id>12158202</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262133000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/12158202/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/1/4/global_12406372.jpeg</photo_url></item>
