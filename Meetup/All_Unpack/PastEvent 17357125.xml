&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333399"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IDEAL PROTEIN &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333399 ; font-size : small"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Ideal Protein is a medically designed and professionally supervised wellness program dispensed by health care professionals. It is a muscle-sparing, fat-targeting weight loss protocol that was created for athletes in France over 20 years ago. You will lose an average of 3-7 pounds per week even without exercise. Ideal Protein is your last diet because it has a beginning and an end where we not only take the weight off and make you healthy; but we show you how to keep it off. It is a four phase protocol: Phases I and II are weight loss, Phase III is acclimation and Phase IV is maintaining your weight loss. So by the end of our diet, perhaps for the first time in your life, you will understand which foods make you gain weight, which foods help you lose weight and which foods help you maintain your healthy ideal weight."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Other members have had success with this program. If you looking to lose that last 10lbs before summer or a bit more this is a great program to help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
