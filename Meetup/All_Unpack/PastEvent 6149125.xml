Does fear dominate your traffic experience on two wheels? Come along and let's talk about it and what you can control on your bike as well as what you might want to let go of. Cycling is still fun for some of us while we interact with traffic and follow the rules. Part of handling your bike in traffic is the art of negotiation as cyclists from the one down position, learning to drive defensively while trusting other road users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discussion will be led by Charley LaFlamme, Northeast Regional Trainer for the League of American Bicyclists, and League Cycling Instructor # 285. Charley is also the founder and first President of the Bicycle Coalition of Maine, a board member of the Bike/Walk Alliance of New Hampshire, a Charter Member of MDOT's Regional Transportation Advisory Committe for Cumberland &amp;amp; York County, and an Originating Member of MDOT's Bicycle Advisory Committee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may get more out of the discussion by first reading our page on &lt;a href="http://bike.meetup.com/132/pages/Vehicular_Cycling/"&gt;Vehicular Cycling&lt;/a&gt;. Another very useful resource is John Allen's &lt;a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/index.htm"&gt;Bicycling Street Smarts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the wisest words I've ever read on safe traffic cycling come from Robert Hurst, author of The Art of Urban Cycling (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Urban-Cycling-Lessons-Street/dp/0762727837/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-9931622-5819253):"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The urban cyclist's best chance is to gather all the responsibilty that can be gathered. Hoard it from those around you. Have faith that you will do a better job with it than they will, and make it so. Don't trust your fate to the police, the planners, the pedestrians, or the paramedics. Don't leave your fate to the stars, or to luck. Definitely don't leave your fate to the drivers.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190416261000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186623503000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Safe Biking in Traffic</name><id>6149125</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190242800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/6149125/</event_url></item>
