I'll keep an eye on river water levels and may have to alter the hike path accordingly. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An after work social hike of about 2 miles in a hidden space that makes you feel miles outside of the city. The Adams Mill Trail loop starts to left of the restaurant (Adams Mill), follows along a dike to the Hockanum River, up the river to a railroad trestle, across the trestle to steps, and downstream on Eighth Utilities property along the river to Adams Street, along sidewalk back to parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On return trip, a little difficult in places due to erosion of the trail, narrow ledges in spots. Beautiful deep hemlock and pine forest, scenic sandstone gorge, view old mill and dam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park at Adams Mill restaurant, 165 Adams Street, Manchester, CT towards the left of the main building:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Manchester&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=165+Adams+St" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;)  is leading on this one so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249162475000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248702204000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at the Adams Mill Trail in Manchester CT</name><id>10966871</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248989400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/10966871/</event_url></item>
