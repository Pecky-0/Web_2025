A film in twelve tableaux, Vivre sa vie examines the life of a woman whose dreams of becoming an actress lead her, instead, to prostitution and eventual tragedy. Insistent that she controls her own destiny, Nana (Anna Karina) becomes another character imprisoned within the system as well as the camera’s static frame of the twelve episodes, resulting in what Susan Sontag described as “one of the most extraordinary, beautiful, and original works of art that I know of.” Charlotte et Véronique or All the Boys are Called Patrick (1959, 20 min.). Students Véronique and Charlotte meet the same man separately and arrange a date with him the next evening. When they both arrive, he arrives with a third woman. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Members, seniors, students $8; general admission $10.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the center of the theater</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235153375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jean-Luc Godard's Vivre sa Vie</name><id>9784378</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235940300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9784378/</event_url></item>
