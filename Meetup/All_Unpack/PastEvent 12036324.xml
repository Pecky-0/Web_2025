Depending on turn out, we will either have dinner at Grand Chinatown or Basta Pasta in Quincy  afterwards. Please indicate if you would like to join us for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is between $15 to $18 per person including shoes for two hours of bowling. The actual cost will depend on the number of persons signed up so the more people we have the lower the per hour rate will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transportation&lt;/b&gt; - for those taking the MBTA, you can take red line to N. Quincy stop. We will arrange for someone to pick you up from there and go to the bowling alley. Please note this in your rsvp if you need a ride.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please meet at the counter.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Warren</member_name><member_id>5756338</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>6110390</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262307356000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260206649000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bowling &amp; Dinner</name><id>12036324</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260651600000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/12036324/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/0/global_6836032.jpeg</photo_url></item>
