This new recording is undiluted David: one man, one acoustic guitar, and a repertoire of mostly traditional material performed with the intimate, assured touch of a musician who has nothing to prove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally a “must-have” session man for everyone from Bob Dylan to Jay &amp;amp; the Americans and subsequently a hard-touring bandleader and recording artist with an enthusiastic following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Paul Rishell &amp;amp; Annie Raines:&lt;br /&gt;Touring internationally at festivals, clubs, and concert halls, and teaching workshops and seminars, Paul Rishell &amp;amp; Annie Raines have earned loyal fans around the globe.
