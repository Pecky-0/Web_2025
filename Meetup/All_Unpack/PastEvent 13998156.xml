If you haven't been to Warwick Neck and Oakland Beach yet, here's you're chance! Top of the Bay sits overlooking Oakland Beach at the top of Greenwich Bay (hence the name...just stating the obvious) and across from Iggy's Doughboys and Chowder where the crowds line up to sample the best of RI fried seafood fare. Top of the Bay has a seasonal deck bar located on the second floor, and seems like the perfect place to perch and enjoy some evening bay breezes on a hot summer day! I haven't been yet, but have wanted to go since last year (when I checked out Iggy's). This is a local spot which might get crowded, and its a little out of the way, but may be well worth the trip. So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
