So we will start with dinner and after dinner, we will talk about various IT vocabulary and help each other with setting up their computers for different purposes. If you can't find us, please call me at 4019548570.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;You can bring your laptop but we will not use them until after the dinner so your laptops will not be contaminated by the food. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this event will serve two purposes. If you have difficulty seeing, typing, IMing in Chinese or if you want to want to find out more about software tools or websites that help you watch lots of Chinese videos and listen to popular Chinese music. You will find them. It might be easier if you bring your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out how to speak IT in Chinese, you will get that too. You will probably learn every word you need to know about computer, computer parts and Internet activities. This will be somewhat technical but it will be incredibly useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316815788000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315837352000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>All about Your Computer: Help Session and Lingo Learning</name><id>33210222</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316473200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/33210222/</event_url></item>
