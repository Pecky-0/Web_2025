Showcasing some of the finest young players the local Jazz scene has to offer, the band has been conquering the heart of its audiences since its inception thanks to its outstanding performances and unique collaborations with its featured artists. As a ten piece orchestra, Jazz Writers' Collective combines the power of a big band and the intimacy of a chamber ensemble; its ever growing repertoire ranges from post be-bop and cool to modern classical music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come for a night of great music, support up and coming talent!&lt;/p&gt;
