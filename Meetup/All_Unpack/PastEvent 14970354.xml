Obama in Boston on Saturday I got some advisement (thanks Bob!) to avoid the downtown area and have moved our Meetup to Lowe's Harvard Sq on Church St at 12:45. I hope this does't affect too many people's plans and I apologize for the late switch but its probably for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Social Network&lt;/b&gt; is the first Fall release to spark Oscar talk and is directed by David Fincher (Zodiac) and scripted by  Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) . The film depicts the origins and impact of Facebook and the story of its  founder, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg. 97% rating on Metacritic and 100% on Rotten Tomatoes Top Critics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been awhile since our group has had an event at  The Boston Common Theaters, any and all suggestions for which restaurant to go to afterward for our group discussion would be greatly appreciated. Chinatown is only a few blocks away- so here's our chance to see a (possible) 4 star movie followed by 4 star cuisine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to the trailer: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB95KLmpLR4" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a grandly entertaining reminder of everything we used to go to the movies for (and still can't get online): sparkling dialogue, thorny situations, soulful performances, and an unusually open-ended and relevant engagement with a major social issue of the day: how we (dis)connect. Time Out New York&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific entertainment - an unlikely thriller that makes business ethics, class distinctions and intellectual-property arguments sexy, that zips through two hours quicker than you can say &amp;quot;relationship status,&amp;quot; and that'll likely fascinate pretty much anyone not named Zuckerberg.
