Let's start with this coming month of Feb and see how it goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to suggest this next meet up - everyone bring in thier favorite photo book. It can be any book with photos that you find interesting. Bring it so you can share with the group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Please bring any new work you've done over the last few months and share with us. We'd really like to see more photos from you all, so think about making a print or two and bring it along! Or feel free to bring a labtop or web address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd also like to thank everyone who sent me a JPEG for the WPC web site! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We very much look forward to seeing you and again.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172363761000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168565626000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography February Meetup</name><id>5386726</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172190600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/5386726/</event_url></item>
