&lt;p&gt;This month in addition to the usual open dream sharing, let's think about our physical senses in dreams, such as for food and drink, using taste, smell, texture, and color. Is it such a contradiction, to have physical sense experiences in dreams?  Do you recall any such dreams of your own? Many people have reported heightened senses in dreams that make colors more vivid, food more intense, smells more intoxicating, music more hypnotic. Peak encounters may be more than just symbolic, but directly inspiring, healing, or transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember once being given in a dream a vial of the essence of the "rose of heaven".  One whiff was so incredible that I was ecstatic for days upon waking. It was like the source of all roses on earth, and yes my life changed soon after forever.  So as primal and powerful as sensory experiences can be in waking life, perhaps they are still but a shadow of the energetic ideals from which they derive, which may be integrated most profoundly in dream consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have fun with inspiring each other with the possibilities!  And remember, amazing dreams are often triggered right before or right after dream groups due to the heightened focus, so even if you don't have a dream to share now, if you want one then you ought to consider attending!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl will be leading, who also leads the fourth Tuesday &lt;a href="http://www.cosmicdocent.com"&gt;Cosmic discussions group&lt;/a&gt; in the same location. Payment is $10 to help rent the space and can be made online or in person. Anyone who cannot afford to pay is encouraged to attend anyway and should &lt;a href="http://www.bostondreamers.com/members/1741395/"&gt;contact Carl&lt;/a&gt; before attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event will be from 7 pm until 9 pm. Space is limited to 15 people. RSVP requested. Please update your RSVP if you are unable to attend, to allow others to attend. Thank you. &lt;br /&gt;
