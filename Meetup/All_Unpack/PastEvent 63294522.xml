Have you ever read the thoughts of other people in your dreams? Has anyone ever read your thoughts in their dreams? Have you ever dreamed the same dream as someone else? The dreaming mind is very sensitive and open to thought forms from other beings, especially people one is close to. In this month's dream Meetup we will explore mind-reading in dreams. Deerheart has telepathic dream experiences to share. Learn techniques for dream telepathy. Bring any dreams you want to share, whether or not they are telepathic dreams, in our safe and supportive community of dreamers. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
