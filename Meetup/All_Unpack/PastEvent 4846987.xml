<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Jury's is a hotel (at Berkeley and Stuart Sts), with a very cool bar scene downstairs.  We'll meet there around 8:30pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we will head out to 33 (33 Stanhope St, around from Hard Rock Cafe), which is one of the best lounge/dance scenes in the city. We will leave Jury's at around 10:00pm, so really try to meet us before 10pm.  If you can't make it early, you can try to find us in 33.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**For those who want to go ALL OUT on Friday - there will be a few of us heading out after 2am...  yes, in Boston!  We will have a LIMITED number of guest passes to Rise, a private club in Boston.  Great music, two levels, serious dancing.**  -- Thanks to Karan for making this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picture is on this site (6ft tall Asian guy shouldn't be too hard to find).  If your picture is up on the site, do RVSP and I'll look for you as well. My phone is 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
