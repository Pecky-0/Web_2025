There has never been anything like this.” — Ben Brantley, New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A provocative and wholly unique hybrid of dance, theatre and music, &lt;b&gt;FELA! explores the world of Afrobeat legend Fela Anikulapo-Kuti.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;Winner of three 2010 Tony Awards including Best Choreography (Bill T. Jones)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using his pioneering music (a blend of jazz, funk and African rhythm and harmonies), FELA! reveals Kuti’s controversial life as an artist and political activist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring many of Fela Kuti’s most captivating songs and Bill T. Jones’ visionary staging, FELA! – an original new creation – comes via Broadway to London and the National Theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Radiates joy.” Entertainment Weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;Top 10 Shows of 2009&lt;/span&gt;.
