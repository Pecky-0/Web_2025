Let's meet in the Oak Bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Either park at the Prudential center or take the Orange Stop at Back Bay. Copley is a block away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENE: The Oak Bar has always been my, and a lot of people's, favorite gathering spot. With it's enormously high ceilings, posh relaxed decor, velvet drapes, it is breathtaking. On a Sunday afternoon there are few people there and it is a perfect spot for light sketching (I'll repeat this below, but decorum suggests nothing more than a sketchbook with pens or pencils). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER: This is more of a travel session, so please pack extra light, ideally nothing more than a 5x8 sketchbook. Also, expect that we will converse while we sketch, unlike most BPAAG meet-ups. Finally, you will be expected to order a drink or appetizer. Drinks, food, even non-alcoholic ones, are pricey there, but not prohibitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call the Inn or myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263236856000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261321857000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>INDOOR SKETCH GET-TOGETHER: The Oak Bar at the Copley Plaza</name><id>12119832</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263063600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/12119832/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/5/c/global_1743932.jpeg</photo_url></item>
