&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanamatsuri - Over 2,500 years ago, a prince was born in the Sakya clan in Lumbini Garden on April 8. Lumbini Garden is located in present day Nepal. His father was King Suddhodana, and his mother, Queen Maya. The queen named her son Siddhartha. It is said that when he was born that he stood, took seven steps and pointing to the earth and heavens said, "In heaven and on earth, I am alone honored." This statement was his vow to show all beings the way to enlightenment and stop their suffering. We celebrate the historical Buddha's birthday decorating a small shrine with flowers to represent the Lumbini Garden. A statue of the infant Buddha is placed into the shrine in a lotus bowl with sweet tea. During the ceremony we pour the sweet tea over the Buddha re-enacting the cleansing of the Buddha by the heavenly beings at his birth. We will be holding the holiday service and a vegetarian potluck meal. Everyone is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
