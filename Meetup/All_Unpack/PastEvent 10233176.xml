We'll be ordering pizza, so be sure to bring a few dollars to pitch in toward the cost.  If you would like to bring a salad or appetizer or dessert, feel free, though it's not mandatory.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is in a private home, you must RSVP to get the address and directions.  That information will be e-mailed to you prior to the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244845326000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240319686000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a meeting</name><id>10233176</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244241900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/10233176/</event_url></item>
