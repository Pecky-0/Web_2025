<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Greeting to all my fellow Hartford Professionals. I am proud to announce the launch of our first initial meeting as group. As you know I host another meetup group in New Haven Connecticut - The Urban Professionals Network (ctupn.com). In order to start of the meetups on the right foot...I have decided to combine both meetup groups for the first event of the season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the cold weather, ice storms, and snow is pretty much behind us....Urban Professionals from across the state will meet downtown New Haven at one of our top venues - The Blue Pearl . Smooth Jazz &amp;amp; R&amp;amp;B, Light appetizers, Business giveaways, and great networking opportunities. This event is a &lt;b&gt;FREE&lt;/b&gt; event so feel free to invite friends &amp;amp; co-workers.   &lt;a href="http://ctupn.com/upn_meet___greet" target="_blank"&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; to register and have a chance to win free membership &amp;amp; door prizes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand New Haven isn't the closest to Hartford, however this will give us a chance to interact and network at a higher level. There will be professionals from New Haven County and Fairfield County and eastern Connecticut. After this first event, I will work with some in Hartford to launch our first Hartford event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any concerns our questions please email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason&lt;br /&gt;info@ctupn.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason V.
