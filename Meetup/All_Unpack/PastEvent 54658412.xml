&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The total ride is 16 miles. 30+ miles, if you want to do the Cranston Section too. &amp;nbsp;It offers nice scenery and water views, complete with waterfalls. It is an interesting path, in that you are riding slightly uphill all the way out. &amp;nbsp;It is not much, but you will notice you get back Quicker and easier. &amp;nbsp;If there is time left, those who want, can head toward Cranston. &amp;nbsp;Not sure how far we will get. &amp;nbsp;The entire path is actually 32 miles round trip, but I like to start in the middle so no one feels pressured to ride more than they are comfortable with. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the end of the path, there is an unpaved section of about 2 miles, if anyone wants to do some off roading. &amp;nbsp;A couple of us went off road last year. &amp;nbsp; I will leave that up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Route 295 South to exit #2, Route 2 South. Take a Right at the Light with the Dunkin Doughnuts and the Parking Lot is , 1/4 mile down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or Route 95 South to exit 12B, the exit splits stay LEFT Route 113 West. 1/2 Mile you will see the Dunkin Doughnuts, keep going straight thru the Light. The Parking Lot is 1/4 mile Down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming 95 North, get on Route 295 North and take I believe the first exit. It is either Route 2 South or Route 113 West. &amp;nbsp;All I know is that there is no Exit 12 on Route 95 heading North and you need to take Route 295 North. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know how to Follow directions or Read a Map, LOL, Enter 700 East Ave Warwick R I in your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave N.</member_name><member_id>10478672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336484324000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330701335000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike the Coventry Greenway</name><id>54658412</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336320000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/54658412/</event_url></item>
