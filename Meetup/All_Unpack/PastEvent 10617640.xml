This would be relevant to anyone looking to get started in digital photo editing, or who would like to better understand the basic features of their photo editing software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workshop fee is $20. Payment is due when you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photoshop CS3 will be used in the workshop, but the demonstration will also be relevant to users of Adobe Elements, Adobe Lightroom, Apple iPhoto, and other versions of Photoshop. Computers are not available in the conference room, but the emphasis of this workshop is on the concepts of digital image processing, not software training in specific applications. All participants will receive a detailed booklet of the information covered, and practice tutorials and files on a CD-R to try at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workshop outline:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Review of the basic photo editing workflow&lt;br /&gt;- Tonal curves in film, monitors, and digital images&lt;br /&gt;- How to interpret a photograph's histogram&lt;br /&gt;- Dynamic range and clipping in digital images&lt;br /&gt;- Enhancing image contrast without losing detail&lt;br /&gt;- Enhancing shadow and highlight detail&lt;br /&gt;- Advanced tonal adjustments with levels and curves&lt;br /&gt;- Color temperature and white balance&lt;br /&gt;- Removing color casts&lt;br /&gt;- Adjusting color saturation&lt;br /&gt;- Touch-up tools and brushes&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>6</waitlist_count><updated>1248912106000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244597443000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Digital Photo Editing 102: Tone and Color</name><id>10617640</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246402800000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/10617640/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
