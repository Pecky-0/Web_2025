Located just off Rte. 9 as you enter Worcester, there is plenty of parking in the museum lot. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

For those who have RSVP'd for the EcoTarium tomorrow, we will be getting a group discounted rate for admission - $7.00 per person.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

In order to get the discount, we have to arrive together at the parking lot gate and drive in together. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

**** We will meet in our cars at 1:30 at the baseball field that is next to the Ecotarium.**** &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We have to make one payment for the whole group, so please plan to bring cash to pay admission. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

See you tomorrow! &lt;br /&gt;
