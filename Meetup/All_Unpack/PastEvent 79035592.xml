<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff00ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have an October Birthday?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Come celebrate mine (October 2) with me at Brothers Kouzina. The food is excellent and is a favorite among social fun folks. There is something for everyone and they are really good even if you have glutten free issues. They serve both American as well as Greek dishes. This is one of my favorite places to eat on the north shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to get to and located on Rt. 1 North in Peabody with plenty of parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No gifts please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rsvp for this event, sorry no drop-ins due to reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: I had to adjust the time to 8:30 since I spoke with the owner Penny, and she said since we are staying for greek night, it would be better than waiting 3 hours. If 8:30 is too late for dinner, then you could also have an appetizer or dessert. This will lead right into greek dancing night and the band starts right at 10 ( see the following meet-up event).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the website for the dinner menu: &lt;a href="http://brotherskouzina.com/dinner.htm"&gt;http://brotherskouzina.com/dinner.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will have a table with a meetup sign on it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Phaedra</member_name><member_id>3140926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349623082000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345740825000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Birthday Celebration - Dinner Portion</name><id>79035592</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349569800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/79035592/</event_url></item>
