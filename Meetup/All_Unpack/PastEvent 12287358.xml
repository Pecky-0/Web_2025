Within the 135-acre seaside park, visitors can enjoy miles of walking trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the park is an ideal location for seaside outdoor recreation, the property is also renowned for its diverse natural history. Seven distinct natural habitats can be visited in a leisurely hour's walk. Although the spectacular rocky shore is the most popular part of Odiorne, the woodlands, uplands, salt marsh, freshwater and salt ponds, and sandy beach combine to create one of the region's most diverse nature walk areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet inside the park at the parking lot in front of the Seacoast Science Center. Please try to arrive a little before noon so that we can head out at noon. Bring water and a snack and please dress appropriately for the weather. Currently the forecast is for a partly sunny day with temps in the 40s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Since the snow may not be too deep you could hike with us instead of skiing or snowshoeing. However if you decide to do this be sure you have nice warm winter hiking boots.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the Parking Lot in front of the Science &amp; Nature Center</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Neil Sheehan</member_name><member_id>7739813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264271359000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Snow &amp; Outdoor Sport Enthusisats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastOutdoorSports</urlname><id>1298081</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Snow &amp; Outdoor Sports</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263230096000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cross Country or Snow Shoeing at Odiorne State Park Rye NH</name><id>12287358</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263747600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastOutdoorSports/events/12287358/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/e/global_12640222.jpeg</photo_url></item>
