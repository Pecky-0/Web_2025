The English Queen Elizabeth I herself favored silk stockings; these were finer, softer, more decorative and much more expensive. Stockings that belonged to her still exist, demonstrating the high quality of the items specifically knitted for her. During this era the manufacture of stockings was of vast importance to many Britons, who knitted with fine wool and exported their wares. Knitting schools were established as a way of providing an income to the poor. The fashion of the period, requiring men to wear short trunks, made fitted stockings a fashion necessity. Stockings made in England were sent to the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men were also the first to knit for an occupation[citation needed].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261006660000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247107405000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>More Fun With Pointy Sticks  -Monday Dec 14th</name><id>10835931</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260833400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/10835931/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/6/global_9564790.jpeg</photo_url></item>
