<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Dear Members,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this next training rehearsal, we will practice the improvisational games that we'll incorporate into our performance repertoire. The variety of these games will strike a balance between being group oriented and two-person scenes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A key theme during this rehearsal will be to &amp;quot;listen&amp;quot; to our partner. We can fully respond to the other character only when we fully receive him or her. Pauses and silence will help us achieve this goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the outset, we'll do an intensive warm up to get us back into the flow of things. This warmup will include a couple drills we haven't seen in the past. After two-hours of mind-stretching work, we'll head over to John Harvard's to eat, drink, and talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See everyone next week!&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275587848000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257963571000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Rehearsal - Training 3</name><id>11851432</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258927200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/11851432/</event_url></item>
