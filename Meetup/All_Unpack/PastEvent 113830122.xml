 Rising above the surrounding forest to a height of 2006 feet, Mount Wachusett is unique in central New England. From the summit, a clear day reveals views of Mt. Monadnock in New Hampshire, the Berkshires to the west, and the Boston skyline to the east. The 3,000-acre Wachusett Mountain State Reservation surrounds the summit and offers a wealth of natural and recreational resources. The Reservation offers 17 miles of hiking and walking trails, including 3.9 miles of the Midstate Trail, which runs from Ashburnham to the Rhode Island border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be doing a loop hike, on a number of different trails that will bring us from the Visitor Center to the summit. and back. With the rough terrain a pair of good boots is a must.
