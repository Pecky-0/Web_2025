&lt;p&gt;Meditation can be one of the easiest and most effective means to living with greater harmony, happiness and well-being. It’s an opportunity to peacefully transform your problems, your fears, and any pain and stress in your life into something more positive. And, it's a great way to set or shift into the perfect mood for your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don’t have to sit in silence for long periods of time to gain the multitude of emotional and physical benefits!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;By participating in this Introduction to Meditation Class, you’ll experience how simple, delightful and easy it can be. You’ll learn:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some simple techniques you can easily do for yourself for any length of time that is comfortable for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to easily get into a meditative state and create pleasurable feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get yourself to use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you can use meditation for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make it easy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; be doing traditional silent meditations. The class will consist of 2-3 guided meditations, with discussion and instruction in between. All you have to do is listen to Ann’s voice as she leads you through the process, like listening to a good story.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;If you RSVP "yes", please be considerate of Ann and others, and either show up, or let us know of your change in plans so we won't be waiting for you or leaving someone on a waiting list unnecessarily. Anyone is welcome, so please feel free to invite others to join you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;“I'm new to guided meditation, but figured, why not? Ann walked us through three meditations that seemed to go by very quickly. I was surprised how easy it was, and how relaxed I was at the end of the first one. Since putting these simple techniques into practice, I feel like I can screen out external noise much more effectively, and I've been able to reach amazing levels of peace and even joy and wonder while meditating already. Thank you, Ann!” Chuck M.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;“I have never meditated before. It has always been hard for me to get difficult thoughts out of my head. Tonight I really relaxed and seemed to go into another world. It was great. Thanks!” Susy C.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;“Your meditations showed how easy it can be to focus – something I usually think of as an effort. Thanks, it was really nice!” John H.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
