&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I have the perfect place to watch it.&amp;nbsp; Its a bar that is centrally located which is right in front of a T Station but also has plenty of free and very accessible street parking right by there.&amp;nbsp; In addition this place has an incredible sound system and 10 large TV's that surround the place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please join me at Blue 22 located in downtown Quincy right in front of Quincy Center less than 5 minute walk, the address is 1237 Hancock Street, Quincy, MA 02169-4342.&amp;nbsp; I know its Monday night and we all have school or work the next morning, but who cares its Monday Night Football and its featuring two Midwest Teams!&lt;/p&gt;
