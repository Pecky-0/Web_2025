See the link below, but if you want to know right now, it's an interactive dungeonesque experience like True Dungeon &lt;a href="http://www.truedungeon.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.truedungeo...&lt;/a&gt; if you've been to GenCon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it cool? Because it gives everyone a chance to see how people really play before they get in your game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This promises to be a really fun meetup so come on out and bring the whole family. TOMB is a kid-friendly experience so spouses and young gamers-in-training can have a blast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: There is no fee from the Boston D&amp;amp;D Meetup, but TOMB charges $20 for adults and $16 for kids 12 and under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd rather not spend the money, don't feel left out, we'll be heading over to Quizno's or DeAngelo's afterwards for sandwiches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Boston weather won't spoil the day, but this is a great event to game, meet new gamers, and discover one of Boston's more interesting locales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://5-wits.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://5-wits.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://5-wits.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152392696000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>United Dungeons &amp; Dragons August Meetup Day</name><id>5014333</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1155398400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/5014333/</event_url></item>
