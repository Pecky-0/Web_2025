&lt;p&gt;PAX is coming! For the third year in a row, we will be doing a PAX East meetup at lunch time on Saturday. Co-ordinate with other members to go to panels and whatnot here in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://east.paxsite.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://east.paxsite.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from their site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"PAX East is a three-day game festival for tabletop, videogame, and PC gamers. We call it a festival because in addition to dedicated tournaments and freeplay areas we've got nerdcore concerts, panel discussions, and an exhibitor hall filled with booths displaying the latest from top game publishers and developers. Even with all this amazing content the best part of PAX East is hanging out with other people who know their shit when it comes to games."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not a hardcore gamer, it's bound to be a lot of fun. Three-day passes are all sold out, but one-day passes are still available for Friday and Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually get a lot of people for these, so the Food vendor areas are best for meeting everyone!  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
