This is only for clothing designers who have started a business, and want to get help and answer questions from some experts. Please honor this because only ten can RSVP and come. We have had some great design, technical and market discussions, with a lot of great results. Please bring some examples of your clothing designs, and be prepared to discuss your business problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our meetup is small and we get to know each other and everyone helps one another. We look forward to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Willett&lt;br /&gt;Organizer, BDL&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Organizer, Boston Fashion Meetup&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Email Shirley for more directions.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256248843000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254251679000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Design Lab: Design, Production &amp; Market Discusssion</name><id>11500213</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255183200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/11500213/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/3/global_9986579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
