So, come on out and meet some new and old friends. We will play some disc golf and take a nice walk along the paths thru this wooded park. Disc golf is a sport where you toss a frisbee like discs along a path into a metal basket. Wimp Disc Golf means, we don't count the score. It is all for the fun of getting outside. You don't have to be good at tossing..just come out and have some fun and get some fresh air. We always have a good time just chatting. You can do all 18 holes or just 9. We'll be out for a few hours. then we will head back to the store and maybe get something to eat or drink. There is no charge to play here or to just walk through the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please join us... remember to wear sneakers or good trail walking shoes, of course some water. The Ticks are still out.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the store across from the park to pick up discs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cindy 107</member_name><member_id>5375585</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258474190000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257288053000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wimp Disc golf</name><id>11786565</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258300800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/11786565/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/a/2/global_8729282.jpeg</photo_url></item>
