We're counting on her to deliver again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been out and the bushes are loading up, so cross your fingers and help us get out and celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that as you venture out in Myles over the course of the next few weeks, you keep your eyes out for the best locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike will only be long enough to reach the best blueberries. I think it's about a quarter of a mile from the car. Bring your own picking paraphernalia, water, good shoes, bug spray, etc.  You are of course free to continue on hiking after we get there but you will be on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are low bush blueberries. There will be bending...We may have to change the start location depending on what we find so be sure to check back here before heading out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parking lot on Upper College Pond Road is sometimes called Parking Lot #2 and also called the "Hiking and Bike Trails" parking lot. There is a large brown wooden sign across the road showing the parking lot entry and there are also yellow caution signs indicating you are nearing the bike paths. It is also &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;a&gt;shown on the park map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which you can print out.   Hope you can make it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Bescherer</member_name><member_id>650729</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jo</member_name><member_id>39131822</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343297583000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341151524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wild Blueberry Madness</name><id>71497832</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342824300000</time><rsvp_limit>36</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/71497832/</event_url></item>
