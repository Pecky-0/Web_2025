Spectacular views and diverse habitats make the Reserve an especially popular destination for nature photographers and birdwatchers. We'll hike the trails and the beach and then stop in the visitor's center, located in the main farmhouse, which contains interpretive exhibits and a gift shop. Figure on 3+ hours of easy hiking, including rests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wells Reserve is a 2,250-acre research, education, and recreation facility, a public-private partnership within the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Wells Reserve facilities are located at historic Laudholm Farm in Wells, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs are not allowed on the Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Northbound from&amp;nbsp;I-95, take exit 19 (Wells)&amp;nbsp;and follow signs to U.S. Route 1 in Wells. Follow Route 1 north 1.5 miles to Laudholm Farm Road (just north of the Lighthouse Depot and south of the Maine Diner, at the second flashing traffic signal). Turn right and follow signs to the Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We'll stop for food afterward, of course...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
