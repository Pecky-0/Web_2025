Join us for a repeat event at Murphy &amp;amp; Scarletti's at the Exchange in Farmington.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a fantastic place to mingle, play pool, dance your heart out or just sit back and watch.  We had such a great time last weekend we have scheduled another one for Thanksgiving weekend.  If you're able to make it please do.  There is usually a cover charge after 9pm of about $5-$10, so come a little early.  We met even more new people there while hanging out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band Pandemonium is playing that night and they are well known in the area, one of our favorites.
