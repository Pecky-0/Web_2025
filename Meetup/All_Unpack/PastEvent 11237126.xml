It’s a great event.  For your $15 admission, you get to select a bowl from the hundreds of hand-made bowls that have been donated by both professional and amateur local potters.  Then on to the scrumptious soups.  With the variety of selections, you will be full well before you try all the ones you wanted to.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch, the bowl is yours to keep!  A great lunch, a bowl to take home, and you’ve supported the work to end hunger in greater Hartford.  What could be better?  Those who are interested may wish to shop the craft fair afterwards.  We’ll meet a noon near the “bowl table.”  Tickets may be purchased in advance from Gloria or at the door.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to RSVP so that we know to look for you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet near the bowl table on the second floor.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256943521000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251639412000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Empty Bowls</name><id>11237126</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256400000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/11237126/</event_url></item>
