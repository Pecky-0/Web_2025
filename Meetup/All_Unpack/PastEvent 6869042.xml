The politico article is really interesting as it deals with how they are skirting finance laws in a very clever way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a project working to get a blimp launched with Ron Paul's name on it underway.   They need to raise $200k by Friday night, and are still a little short of the goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to launch it from North Carolina on the 10th, fly over the Washington-Boston corrider to arrive in Boston in time for the Tea Party, then spend three weeks touring New Hampshire until the primary.  Also on the list is Times Square on New Year's, where the blimp will be seen via live television all over the world.  There are even plans to hover over the other candidates at their own NH rallies.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will likely get all kinds of media attention, probably worth at least ten times the cost of the blimp itself.  Many reports, as well as XM radio, have already asked to be on board when it sails over Washington, D.C.  It is also hoped that the buzz and presence of the blimp will drive the Tea Party fundraiser higher - perhaps making back the cost of the blimp on that day alone.  Even Dr. Paul himself has said that he is excited to see the blimp take flight.  IF YOU DONATE $5,000, YOU CAN GET A RIDE ON THE BLIMP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to help, please consider sponsoring the blimp by going to the following website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronpaulblimp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronpaulblimp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://ronpaulblimp.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for a good laugh, check out some of the parodies that have already appeared:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://minironpaulblimp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://minironpaulblimp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://minironpaulbli...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronpaulblimped.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronpaulblimped.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://ronpaulblimped...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197259457000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196975860000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Raise Money to get the blimp to NH</name><id>6869042</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197086400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6869042/</event_url></item>
