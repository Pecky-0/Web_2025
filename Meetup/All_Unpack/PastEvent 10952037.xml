The loop Jenny usually does is about 45 minutes +/-, but she will try to remember to bring a trail map in case we are interested in something longer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring bags, and water if you think your dog will need it.  Jenny will be the the girl with the greyhound  (Annie) and I'll be the brunette with the little pup of a bichon (Breezy) driving a vintage - old - white audi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chat soon, Kristan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just is case you are wondering how to get there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two parking lots at the Sheepfold field, which hopefully won't be full that time of the morning.  If you type &amp;quot;Sheepfold, Medford, MA&amp;quot; into google maps, you should be able to get directions from your home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, heading north on I-93, take exit 33, and get off at the first exit (it's a rotary) forFellsway W / MA-28.  Go 1.7 miles and you will see a sign for the park on your left (it probably just says &amp;quot;Middlesex Fells&amp;quot; and may not mention the Sheepfold).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Jenny will be the the girl with the greyhound  (Annie) and I'll be the brunette with the little pup of a bichon (Breezy) driving a vintage - old - white audi</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristan</member_name><member_id>8717151</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249133486000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248477336000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come explore the Fells</name><id>10952037</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248615000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/10952037/</event_url></item>
