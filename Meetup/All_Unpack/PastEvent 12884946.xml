<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Kent Falls is a dramatic cascade with water falling 200 feet in a series of steps to the Housatonic River.  This area has been featured in many photos and paintings.  The area was first given to the state by the White Memorial Foundation, and then other parcels were added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 1.5 miles with a large uphill climb by the falls.  Then we will return by some trails I haven’t tried before.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  Afterwards we will have a picnic lunch at the base of the falls.  Rain cancels.  Rain before the walk will make the falls more spectacular.  Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  450 Kent Cornwall Rd, Kent, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=450+kent+cornwall+rd,+kent,ct&amp;amp;sll=41.75441,-73.441887&amp;amp;sspn=0.079141,0.142479&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=450+Kent+Cornwall+Rd,+Cornwall+Bridge,+Litchfield,+Connecticut+06754&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270478512000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268692835000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kent Falls SP Walk, Kent, CT</name><id>12884946</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270305000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/12884946/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/b/global_2859963.jpeg</photo_url></item>
