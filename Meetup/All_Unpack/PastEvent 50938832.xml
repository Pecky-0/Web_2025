&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:15PM Showtime.&amp;nbsp; I will be at the theater by 6:15 and we will head in for seats as soon as they let us.&amp;nbsp; Probably around 6:30.&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="color : #2375a4"&gt;Please note this is showing in the imax theater downstairs, so please come early.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; There is no really convenient gathering spot.&amp;nbsp; I will be near the ropes by the concession stand, until/unless they let us line up in the inner lobby.&amp;nbsp; It will be a mad scramble for seats once they let people in, so the group will head in right away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I like to see these movies during opening weekend, it is usually a good idea to buy your tickets ahead of time....especially if it is a big movie with lots of buzz.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.&amp;nbsp; If this is not possible because they shoo us out from the downstairs theater, we will also gather on the sidewalk outside for a few minutes also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after and bring cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Plot Summary:&lt;/span&gt;From Academy Award&amp;reg;&amp;ndash;winning filmmaker Andrew Stanton comes "John Carter"&amp;mdash;a sweeping action-adventure set on the mysterious and exotic planet of Barsoom (Mars). "John Carter" is based on a classic novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, whose highly imaginative adventures served as inspiration for many filmmakers, both past and present. The film tells the story of war-weary, former military captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who is inexplicably transported to Mars where he becomes reluctantly embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions amongst the inhabitants of the planet, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). In a world on the brink of collapse, Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands. &lt;br /&gt;
