My Pugs are bored.  My  Frenchies are bored.  Somebody, as yet unnamed, actually chewed a hole in one of my rugs.  But today is actually a nice day!  The yard is actually dry (if not yet raked for the summer...).  Why waste it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am hosting an entirely spontaneous Pug Meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fenced yard, parking, fresh water, and four very bored little dogs provided.  You can bring cookies and coffee or nothing at all.  I have a bag and a half of Hershey's Miniatures and several bottles of naturally fruit flavored seltzer water, if anyone is desperate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240167494000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238939570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Entirely Spontaneous Pug Meetup</name><id>10119009</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238954400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/10119009/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/1/8/global_7987560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
