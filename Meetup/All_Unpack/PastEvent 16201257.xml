Our own Arlene has invited everyone to enjoy an evening at her home on top of Munjoy Hill in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought a V-Day theme would be fun, and while chocolates, tarts, pies, and cakes are highly encouraged :) , feel free to bring whatever you'd like to share, however simple or extravagant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if anyone wants to start a raw food &amp;quot;book club&amp;quot;, bring a few book titles that you're interested in reading and discussing. We can take a vote during our gathering and figure out which one we're most excited to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have any questions, comments or ideas. I look forward to meeting you all in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care!&lt;br /&gt;Nicki&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Those who RSVP &lt;b&gt;yes&lt;/b&gt; will be emailed the exact location of this meetup.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nickola Cole</member_name><member_id>2550973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297610006000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawmaine</urlname><id>1161576</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Raw Maine: The Way Food Should Be!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296090388000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February Potluck!</name><id>16201257</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297549800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawmaine/events/16201257/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/d/global_7695373.jpeg</photo_url></item>
