<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a members-only meeting which means you must have paid the   full dues of $40.00 and signed the statement of ethics prior to the   meeting to be able to attend. No visitors are allowed at this meeting   because of confidentiality rules. Being a member of this meetup group is not   the same as being a member of the Innovators Resource Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not too late to email us if you would like to present about your idea or progress report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  it is always a good idea to rsvp "Yes" to meetup events. That  way  organizers can contact only the people who rsvp'ed with any updates  or  changes to the event, instead of emailing the whole list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRN members - do you want to present to the closed meeting ? - This is a  closed meeting and your opportunity to get a focus  group and/or advice  or else inform us of your progress. Please email or  contact us if you  wish to take advantage of this - (message Michael or  Karen here or  email infoATirnetworkDOTorg )&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>same place</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Kat.</member_name><member_id>8999115</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Blanchard</member_name><member_id>9728219</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304594249000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1303672495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May members-only meeting</name><id>17416434</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304550000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/17416434/</event_url></item>
