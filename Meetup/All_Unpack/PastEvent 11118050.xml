Set against breathtaking backdrops, the film is the story of an idea as uniquely American as the Declaration of Independence and just as radical — that the most special places in the nation should be preserved, not for royalty or the rich, but for everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Burns and series writer / co-producer Duncan will screen highlights from the 12-hour series. Included are scenes from Denali National Park that feature photographs by Brad Washburn, renowned explorer and founding director of the Museum, as well as interviews with Brad and Barbara Washburn&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;Tickets&lt;/b&gt;: $8. The event in Cahners Theater is sold out. &lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Due to high demand, we are opening a separate theater for overflow seating and simulcast viewing of the program&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Purchase tickets in person at the Museum box office, by phone at 617-723-2500, or online&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... although seating in the main room is sold out, does anybody feel like gathering in the overflow room? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be in the lobby of the Museum of Science starting at 5:50 pm. We can go see where we can grab seats at 6:10 pm in the overflow room. Eh, it won't be the same as being in the same room as the presentation, but it would still be good to see it. Nerd Fun has visited many a National Park this past year. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. After we can go out somewhere to eat, maybe the Cheesecake Factory in the CambridgeSide Galleria. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Ken Burns, from the PBS site:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/filmmakers/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pbs.org/ke...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ken Burns has been making documentary films for more than 30 years. Since the Academy Award-nominated Brooklyn Bridge in 1981, he has gone on to direct and produce some of the most acclaimed historical documentaries ever made. The late historian Stephen Ambrose said of Ken’s films, 'More Americans get their history from Ken Burns than any other source.' A December 2002 poll conducted by RealScreen Magazine listed The Civil War as second only to Robert Flaherty’s Nanook of the North as the 'most influential documentary of all time' and named Ken Burns and Robert Flaherty as the “most influential documentary makers” of all time&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Dayton Duncan:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/filmmakers/duncan.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pbs.org/ke...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Dayton Duncan is an award-winning writer and documentary filmmaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;He is the author of nine books. Out West: A Journey Through Lewis &amp;amp; Clark's America chronicles his retracing of the Lewis and Clark trail; it was a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate selection and finalist for the Western Writers of America's Spur Award. Grass Roots: One Year in the Life of the New Hampshire Presidential Primary is a unique look at presidential politics through the experiences of grass roots volunteers. Miles From Nowhere: In Search of the American Frontier examines the current conditions, history, and people of the most sparsely settled counties in the United States. Lewis &amp;amp; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery, published in November 1997; Mark Twain, published in November 2001; and Horatio's Drive, 2003, are companion books to documentary films he wrote and produced. His most recent work is Scenes of Visionary Enchantment: Reflections on Lewis &amp;amp; Clark, a collection of essays released in conjunction with the Lewis and Clark bicentennial&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About &amp;quot;National Parks: America's Best Idea&amp;quot; coming 9/27/2009 on PBS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pbs.org/na...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Filmed over the course of more than six years at some of nature's most spectacular locales — from Acadia to Yosemite, Yellowstone to the Grand Canyon, the Everglades of Florida to the Gates of the Arctic in Alaska — The National Parks: America's Best Idea is nonetheless a story of people: people from every conceivable background — rich and poor; famous and unknown; soldiers and scientists; natives and newcomers; idealists, artists and entrepreneurs; people who were willing to devote themselves to saving some precious portion of the land they loved, and in doing so reminded their fellow citizens of the full meaning of democracy. It is a story full of struggle and conflict, high ideals and crass opportunism, stirring adventure and enduring inspiration - set against the most breathtaking backdrops imaginable&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can picture going to the &lt;b&gt;Museum of Science&lt;/b&gt; just once this year with a friend, purchasing a &lt;b&gt;Basic 2&lt;/b&gt; membership &lt;a href="https://store.mos.org/?action=memb_buy" target="_blank"&gt;https://store.mos.org...&lt;/a&gt; for $75.00 a good value.

[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It is recommended that visitors allow approximately one hour to go through the exhibit&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Um, I am not sure, but it looks like the Museum of Science is already having people sign up for this members preview at &lt;a href="https://store.mos.org/?action=showevent;event_id=530" target="_blank"&gt;https://store.mos.org...&lt;/a&gt; ? I need to call up the Museum of Science to check on this. I'd like a group of us to be able to go through this exhibit together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets seem to be $26.00 for non-members (probably covering admission to the general exhibit plus $6.00 for this special exhibit) and only $5.00 for members of the Museum of Science (General admission to the exhibits is free + $5.00 for this exhibit). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibits that are closing:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;u&gt;National Geographic Crittercam: The world through animal eyes&lt;/u&gt; is closed after Sunday 8/30/2009 &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;a href="http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/current_exhibits&amp;amp;d=3136" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mos.org/ex...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;u&gt;Black Holes: Space Warps &amp;amp; Time Twists&lt;/u&gt; is closing after Monday 9/7/2009&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;a href="http://www.mos.org/exhibits_shows/current_exhibits&amp;amp;d=3145" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mos.org/ex...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
