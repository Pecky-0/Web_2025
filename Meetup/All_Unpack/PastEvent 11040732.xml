But that's just an informal side thing.  Between her vitamix and juicer, people could bring fruits and veggies if they wanted to, or a dish if they preferred and we could whip some things up.  There are also loads of trails near Beth's house (and we have a short wooded path behind us to a lake as an alternative) and kids are welcome.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is totally last minute, but if you're interested, that would be awesome! Hope all is well and you're enjoying your summer!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin</member_name><member_id>7947968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249920425000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Vegetarian/Vegan Enthusiast</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood</urlname><id>1312890</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Vegetarian and Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249475975000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Raw Vegan Potluck/Smoothie/Juice Event This Saturday at Noon!!</name><id>11040732</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249747200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood/events/11040732/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/2/global_9211362.jpeg</photo_url></item>
