&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Event Rating: Difficult&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 30-36 Miles&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Time Duration: 4 Hours&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Blaze Orange: NOT REQUIRED&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Helmet: Required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Directions: From Route 6 at the RI/CT border, go west on Route 6 for about 25 Miles to North Windham. Just past the Walmart, take ramp right for US-6 West toward Hartford / Willimantic. Go 5.4 mi and keep straight onto CT-66 / Middletown Rd. Go 1.8 mi and turn left onto CT-87 / Jonathan Trumbull Hwy. Go 1.8 mi and turn left onto Latham Hill Rd. At 0.6 mi road name changes to Synagogue Rd. Continue 0.5 mi and turn right onto Cook Hill Rd. Go 0.4 mi to trailhead. Note: there is no actual addres at 251 Cook Hill Rd, but the map needs an address to put a point on the map. Park at the trailhead on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

I encourage people to carpool, but since this hike is local for me I won’t be carpooling. Maybe you want to arrange meet at the Ocean State Job Lot on Route 6 in Johnston at, say 8:35 (Bing says an hour and 18 minutes from there to the trailhead).&lt;/p&gt;

This portion of the trail runs mostly through rural forested country, with only the occaisonal glimpse of a house or a road crossing. This time of year, flowering trees and plants perfume the air with their scent, making the deep breathing of exertion a joy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will ride for 3 ½ to 4 hours, going about 16 miles from Lebanon to East Hampton,then returning for a total distance of about 32 miles. The trail is 6-10 feet wide, finished with compacted dirt / stone dust, and is suitable for most bikes but NOT for skinny road tires. (So mountain bikes, hybrids, and road bikes with beefed up tires are appropriate.) The rating for this event is difficult (but not strenuous) due to the distance and the pace. I want to maintain an average speed of 11-12 mph. This means we will be going somewhat faster (16-18mph) on the downgrades and a bit slower (7-10) mph on the upgrades. The good news is that there are no “hills” on this ride (the steepest grade is 2-3%), but since the grades are fairly constant for miles at a time, we will climb (and go downhill) 850 feet over the course of the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this trail section is in the Salmon River State Forest, which covers 6,000 acres. Other highlights include Raymond Brook Marsh, Grayville Falls, Salmon River, and two impressive viaducts (filled-in stream valley crossings).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bike helmet is required for this event. As always bring sufficient water and snacks along for a 3 ½ - 4 hour ride. Sunglasses will help keep bugs from landing in your eyes. Sun screen is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
