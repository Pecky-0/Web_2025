&lt;p&gt;Next weekend we are hosting another Young Eagles event. They always draw in a bunch of the kids and parents. Since this is an opportunity for the public to come down and see the airport, it would be nice to work on the terminal curb appeal. There are a couple of things that we have been talking with the Airport about. Thanks to Deb Schweitzer, we have a plan to plant some flowers around the picnic tables. She has done a lot of work getting things to come together. Getting the picnic tables stained and the (very weathered) side of Autumn Air Services painted will also do a lot for the &amp;ldquo;first impression&amp;rdquo; people get when they drive down the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be there at 8:30 or so for breakfast and be ready to work by 9:00am. It looks like the weather will be good, so I expect that when the work is done, we will need to fly out for some ice cream. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please meet me at the terminal area Saturday morning to help out. This is a great opportunity for the FPA to give back to the airport that we all love.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1315664394000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315503929000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Airport Garden Project</name><id>32769892</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315659600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/32769892/</event_url></item>
