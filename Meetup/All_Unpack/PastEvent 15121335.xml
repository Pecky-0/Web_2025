In this hilarious, kinetic solo piece, writer/performer Ross plays all the characters, recreates the effects, sings from John Williams’ score, flies the ships, and fights both sides of the battles from the original Star Wars trilogy, punctuating his virtuosic performance with captivating factoids and editorial asides. No costumes, no sets – just Ross using his yoga-limber body, knack for voices, and manic levels of energy. Did he spend too much of his childhood in a galaxy far, far away? Well, let’s just say that by age 10, he had seen the first Star Wars film more than 400 times and committed virtually every line to memory. Ross has since parlayed this childhood obsession into a one-of-kind theatrical piece, which he has performed to sell-out crowds in more than 180 cities across four continents. Where does he get his strength? It flows from the Force, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Tickets: $20 general admission/$17 Coolidge Corner Theatre members. Tickets available online at www.coolidge.org/onstage or at the Coolidge box office, 290 Harvard Street, Brookline&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY performed with permission of Lucasfilm Ltd.

All rights reserved&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase your tickets ahead of time, since special programs like this do sell out before the day of the event. A line will probably be forming to be seated at 7:15 pm. We probably should be getting in line around then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody want to grab a bite to eat and hang out in Panera Bread before then? T.J. Maher will be at Panera Bread across from the theater starting at 6:00 pm. Please update your RSVP the day before ithe latest if you feel like dropping in to Panera so T.J. knows how many tables to commendeer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. He'll throw a few red MEETUP table tents on a few tables. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the play, from the Cleveland Times, 4/29/2009:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/04/charles_ross_performs_oneman_s.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cleveland....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Every time Charles Ross performs, it's proof that the human imagination is mightier than Industrial Light and Magic. Ross is the writer and solo performer of 'One-Man Star Wars Trilogy,' a stage show that requires him to become every droid, Wookiee and garbage-dwelling serpent in the original three &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot; movies. He sings the music, mimics the special effects and fights against himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; 'One-Man Star Wars Trilogy' premieres Wednesday at the Cleveland Play House, as part of FusionFest 2009, the theater's fourth annual multidisciplinary arts festival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ross works without costumes and sets in the 60-minute show. He holds his hands over each ear to mimic Princess Leia's hair buns. When he makes a big circle over his head with his arms, that's the Death Star. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It can't help but be funny, especially since Ross also tweaks the more ridiculous aspects of 'Star War's' dialogue and plots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; 'Don't try to overcomplicate it,' said Ross, 34, calling from his home in Victoria, British Columbia. &amp;quot;I can't be a light saber. It's just me. That's part of the weirdness.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ross has performed his weird act more than 1,200 times in 220 cities on four continents over seven years. Sometimes his fans are hard-core types at &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot; conventions or at the San Diego Comic-Con. Sometimes they are folks who haven't seen the movies since they were released in the 1970s and 1980s. Ross thinks both groups can appreciate his funny take on the iconic movies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Like all true 'Star Wars' fans, Ross can vividly recall seeing it for the first time. The year was 1978, he was 4 years old, and he watched it in Waikiki, Hawaii, where his family lived for part of the year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; 'It was like watching bliss,' Ross said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Later on, he became interested in theater and earned a fine arts degree from the University of Victoria. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The one-man performance was born in 2001, while Ross was writing radio plays for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. A group of radio playwrights decided to present a night of plays for a theater audience, but they needed more material. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ross had been thinking about how he would do a solo 'Star Wars,' and decided to try it. To his amazement, the audience laughed at everything he did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Later, he added material from the next two movies in the first trilogy. A Chicago theater owner provided an opportunity for Ross to have his first professional run. Ross also got an official blessing from 'Star Wars' creator George Lucas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Now he spends eight months out of the year performing at various theater festivals around the country. The hardest person to portray is Yoda, the short, green and syntax-challenged Jedi knight. Ross can easily drop to his knees, but getting the voice right is harder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;He cuts loose when he's playing the Emperor: 'He's the most sarcastic jerk in the world,' Ross said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;He has no plans to add material from the more-recent prequel trilogy of films, but he does have an eye on doing a one-man 'The Lord of the Rings. He's working to get legal permission to do material from the Peter Jackson films.
