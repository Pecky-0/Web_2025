Think The Avery on steroids. Its truely stunning and of course I spent a few minutes up close to the murals to examine the painting technique. They are known for their wine selection and I went here last summer during Restaurant Week and the food was great too! The parking lot is small, but there is also parking on the street. So if you've been wanting to go or haven't ever been, here's your chance! So let's check it out! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a silver scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
