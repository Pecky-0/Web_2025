You can make a loop back to the same trailhead by following the Laura Cowles Trail (6.0 miles; 2,700 feet; 4:20)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.summitpost.org/view_object.php?object_id=394742" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting There&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailhead is located in Underhill State Park on the Northwest side of the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from I-89N (North of Burlington) take exit VT-15E E ALLEN ST/ GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC HWY for 12 miles. Turn right on River Road follow for 6 miles, River Road will become Pleasant Valley Road. Follow Pleasant Valley Road for 2 miles to obvious parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route Description&lt;/b&gt; From Underhill Center parking follow the gravel road to the Underhill Ranger station. From the Ranger Station follow the CCC road or Eagle Cut trail to trailheads for Sunset Ridge and Laura Cowles trail (marked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trails turns left into forest with bridge crossings over many streams.

In winter, blowing snow and clouds are very common conditions on the summit. Above the tree line, complete whiteouts leading to disorientation may occur; be very cautious when ascending in these conditions. Visibility may be only 20 feet, so it is very easy to get lost while ascending or descending from the summit. Use less exposed routes in these conditions, for example use Laura Cowles trail instead of Sunset Ridge (Sunset Ridge is exposed for over 50% of the route).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will carpool up from Lebanon, NH  I89  the EMS rear parking lot  is a good place to meet and is about 2 hours from the trail heads. Cell phone service at the trailhead is unreliable. We are aiming for an 8:30 start, but carpooling is best since this is new territory for most of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full winter gear mandatory! Being prepared, traveling with the appropriate gear &amp;amp; knowing how to use it is your personal responsibility. Test and adjust your gear prior to this trip. Snowshoes, crampons, and micro spikes a must!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!! NO COTTON CLOTHING !! - Cotton (a.k.a. the death cloth) has no place in the mountains. If you arrive wearing cotton clothing you will be turned away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>please list your phone number.
