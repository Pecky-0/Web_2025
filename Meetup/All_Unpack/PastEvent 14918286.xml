Pugs become Princesses or Cowboys or Dragons, or anything else their doting people can think of!!  There will be games and prizes, food and fun!!Please come, and invite another pug! You KNOW you know one!!  Hope to see you all at this HOWL-O-WEEN BASH!!&lt;br /&gt;ONE WORD-- BOW-WOW-NIES!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOST A MEETUP?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let your organizer know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We try to schedule the meetups for the 2010 calendar in advance so that you can plan your Puggies' social calendar! Please note that all of the Sunday meetups are scheduled to take place at at Assistant Organizer Sharon's home in Carver - where Buford, Millie, and Max hang out - and all of the Saturday Meetups are scheduled to take place at your Organizer Charlotte Creeley's home in Brockton - at Casa Clovis and Cletus. However, we are always delighted to change the venue when someone else wants to host a meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're hoping that the folks who have hosted before will be able will step in and host a social or two in 2010. For those who haven't hosted before, but would like to try, and if you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 30 to 60 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host! It's fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your babies. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. If he starts bullying or being too rough with another dog, give him a time out until he can get himself under control. We want everyone to have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $72.00 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis's and Cletus's faces when the Puggie meetups roll around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shar</member_name><member_id>2833949</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288103557000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285633814000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PUG HALLOWEEN!!!</name><id>14918286</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287939600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/14918286/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/9/global_5934937.jpeg</photo_url></item>
