It will be an afternoon to enjoy the beautiful farm, foliage, music, friends and of course the animals.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For a $10.00 donation per adult (children under 12 free) you can come and picnic in the fields behind the barn (bring your own lunch and blanket or chairs). There will be some sandwiches, drinks and desserts as well, but make sure you get there early as we may run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be scheduled barn tours every hour to meet the animals and hear their stories.  Make sure you sign-up for a tour when you check in as they are limited to 10 people per tour!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maple Farm Sanctuary&lt;br /&gt;101 North Ave, Mendon, MA&lt;br /&gt;www.maplefarmsanctuary.org &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be free parking at the farm.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions you can reach me at 508-459-1074 or you can email me as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  I was thinking maybe we could get there around 10 or 11 to help them set up for the day... if I hear back from some of you in favor of this I'll change the start time.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dreads, glasses and a whole lot of veganess ;)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309486802000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223223304000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp November Meetup</name><id>8900618</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1225648800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/8900618/</event_url></item>
