<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Come join your Beanstalk friends for dinner and a movie.  Unfortunately the Circle Cinema is closing permanently on September 7th.  So this month we'll start at the Applebee's next door to the Circle Cinema for dinner, then drive to the Chestnut Hill AMC Theater for the movie.  If you come on the T, we'll make sure you get a ride with somebody. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular price for the movie $9.75.  However, Tuesday is &amp;quot;Senior Day&amp;quot;, so if you're 60 or older it's only $5.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those that come to dinner get to help pick the movie for the evening. The first to arrive will grab a table at Applebee's (next to old Circle Cinema) around 6:15 PM. During dinner we will review what movies are playing and have a start time between 7:30 and 8:00 PM. Whatever the majority can agree on is what we'll see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP Marie will respond with her cell phone number so if you're running late and can't make dinner, you can find out what movie we've decided to see and when it starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Address for the Theater is:&lt;br /&gt;AMC Chestnut Hill 5&lt;br /&gt;27 Boylston Street (Route 9)&lt;br /&gt;Chestnut Hill, MA. 02467&lt;br /&gt;617-277-2500&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send those that RSVP "Yes" or "Maybe" my cell phone number.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marie A</member_name><member_id>4623326</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221912435000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218764646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a Movie Night</name><id>8548031</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220998500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/8548031/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/b/global_3153499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
