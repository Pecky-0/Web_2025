At the last meetup, we decided to try this place out and try to stay cool in case of hot weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no charge for the use of the Dogtopia facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some general info about services offered at Dogtopia: They offer 4 large playrooms, and the little guys have a space that is separate from the larger breeds.  The space is cool in the summer...and warm in the winter.  Their playroom floors are thickly rubber padded, so the dogs can run without slipping or risking any injury.  They also offer &amp;quot;spa treatments&amp;quot;, a self-serve dog wash area, training, and overnight stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you may not see the facility right away.  Once you reach the Endicott Plaza, drive behind the Market Basket store. You will see a large blue awning with the &amp;quot;Dogtopia&amp;quot; logo. If you see that... then you have arrived!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;** Please bring plenty of pooper-scooper bags to pick up after your dog. **&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;-laura&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Molly and I will be waiting inside the door!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217862562000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215270605000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel August Meetup</name><id>8280825</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217689200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/8280825/</event_url></item>
