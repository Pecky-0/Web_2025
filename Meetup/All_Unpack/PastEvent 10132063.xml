The park encompasses nearly one-fifth of the entire land area of the city and represents a significant natural, watershed and public recreational resource in eastern Massachusetts - let's make use of this amazing resource!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding Lynn Woods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Route 128 North or South: Take Exit 43 in Lynnfield. (From this point, it is 4.0 miles to Lynn Woods.) At the bottom of the ramp, head east, following signs to Walnut Street, Saugus/Lynn. At 1.5 miles, bear left at the fork. You will cross over Route One and continue into Lynn (the boundary is unmarked) on Walnut Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a blinking light, turn left onto Pennybrook Road (opposite O'Callaghan Way). Go to the end of Pennybrook Road and between two stone pillars into the reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Route 1 North or South: Take the Walnut Street exit in Saugus and head east on Walnut Street into Lynn. At 2.0 miles, turn left at a blinking light onto Pennybrook Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are welcome - bring Bags!!
