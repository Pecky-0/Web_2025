&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crosby Park is located by Dearborn Academy between Oxford Street and Winter Street in Arlington, close to Rt 16 and the Somerville line.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;I'm am planning to make this a regularly scheduled weekly Meetup on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at Crosby Park for intermediate players only. Because this is a small park (only four courts),&amp;nbsp; the maximum sign-up will be limited to 8 (with an automated waitlist). 
&lt;strong&gt;When you RSVP, please note your ETA.&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;I will be there at 6pm hitting at the backwall or practicing serves until the first person shows up. Depending on the the number of people who show up, we will play doubles or a mix of doubles and singles.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;This meetup is for intermediate players ( 
&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/about/"&gt;levels 3.5 and higher&lt;/a&gt;) in competitive play. Thanks.
 &lt;br /&gt;If you are disappointed that this particular meetup does not include beginners, you're welcome to join the weekend meetups or please feel free to suggest additional meetups on the day and location of your choice.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;During the week in the evenings, it can be more challenging getting free courts so we will probably need to work out some kinks as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[These courts are accessible through public transportation by taking the Red Line to Davis Square and catching the 87 bus towards Arlington Center to the Oxford Street stop.]&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>4498873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1312326999000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311709913000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tues PM Intermediate - CANCELLED -</name><id>27122811</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1312322400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/27122811/</event_url></item>
