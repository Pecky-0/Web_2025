This weekend we're hosting a slideshow, benefit, talk, Q&amp;amp;A with Mike (the injured climber) and his rescuers from the O.M. Rescue Team.  You'll see amazing footage of climbing in the Rocky Mountains, Ouray Ice Park, and of the actual rescue itself.  We're also working on getting BEER approved at the event. (Fingers Crossed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike is on the road to recovery and has just returned to climbing but he's come a long way.  From near death, to wheelchair confinement, to crutches, to a cane, and now what it's like to live and climb with his &amp;quot;disabilities&amp;quot;....Mike is a huge inspiration proving there is life after serious injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you'll join us. It's free, it's a great New Haven climbing community event, and you'll surely learn a great deal from the amazing climbers and real life hero's of the OMRT&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Room LC101.
