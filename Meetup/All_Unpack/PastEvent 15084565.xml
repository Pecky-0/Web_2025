Lots of great lobbying can happen at this time that will impact animal welfare.  We want you to know the most effective ways to get involved and communicate your message.&lt;br /&gt;We will show you basic &amp;quot;lobby&amp;quot; techniques for citizen advocates and provide information regarding some of the activities happening this year. We will also look to the next session which begins in January of 2011, and review possible issues to pursue legislatively including but not limited to animal welfare funding, horse protection, and wildlife related legislation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take time to attend this meeting to support the ongoing efforts to protect the animals of Maine.&lt;br /&gt;This event is free of charge, but an R.S.V.P. is requested to attend. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in Meeting Room # 5.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289069643000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286900346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lobby 101 for Animals in Portland!</name><id>15084565</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1289064600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/15084565/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/c/global_12530060.jpeg</photo_url></item>
