<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The International Mountain Climbing School (IMCS) is holding their annual Mount Washington Valley Ice Festival on Fri-Sun, Feb 3-5.&amp;nbsp; Come celebrate the season, expand your winter climbing/mountaineering skills, demo new gear, meet more great people, and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the days, they are offering special rates&amp;nbsp;on an array of hands-on courses taught by either their certified guides or pro climbers. The courses range from beginner to advanced level&amp;nbsp;on ice climbing, mixed climbing, and mountaineering topics.&amp;nbsp; Or you can also sign up for a guided expedition.&amp;nbsp; Or if you're already skilled, take some demo gear out for a test-drive.&amp;nbsp; Most daily activities end by 3:30 pm and there is an after-party (until 5 pm) at IME to socialize and enjoy treats and drinks with the climbing community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday night there will be a multi-media show by Will Gadd (one of the world's best; love that guy!), and a pro dry-tooling competition.&amp;nbsp; On Saturday night, there will be an open dry-tooling session, and film festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;As a group&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who RSVP and/or contact me,&amp;nbsp;we'll then&amp;nbsp;make plans for carpooling (if interested), meeting up for dinner(s), and/or at the evening festivities.&amp;nbsp; A great chance to socialize and make more cool&amp;nbsp;friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;On your own&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can come up for whichever days/activities you want. Contact IMCS directly to book a course or excursion with them.&amp;nbsp; Full details on their website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lodging, you'll need to make your own arrangements. IMCS lists several recommendations on their website: &lt;a href="http://ime-usa.com/imcs/lodging.html"&gt;http://ime-usa.com/imcs/lodging.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, I'll be staying at the White Mountains Hostel (listed as "Hostelling International"): &lt;br /&gt;
