Numbers of people matter! It does not matter if you live outside of Portsmouth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have identified the taxers who again raised our property taxes in the worst recession in American History. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Taxers are up for re-election. I need people who will put up signs and stand with the sign during voting hours letting voters know WHO the taxers are. Taxers LOVE to hide and are horrified when people publicly call them out. Voters cheered me on the last time I did this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have identified the people running who will LOWER our taxes. People will vote their pocket books this election.As most voters have no IDEA who voted in taxes - they are quite surprised and cheering! when they see people with signs identifying the taxers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact me and let's put an end to unsustainable big city budgets - David Kish 433-9593&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257443856000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256696240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ID the Portsmouth Taxers for Votersâ€”BIG FUN!</name><id>11729278</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257256800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/11729278/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
