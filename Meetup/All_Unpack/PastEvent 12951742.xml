Everyone who attended last time received something from the experience.  We introduced ourselves and what kind of energy work we provide.  Some members were there because they are exploring many different avenues of healing.  Everyone who attended was very open to learning new information.  Dan shared some of his knowledge about cranial sacral work and showed us an energy procedure that we all practiced on each other.  I know for myself I felt a space open up in the back of my head and my partner could feel one of my skull bones shift.  This allowed me to release so much energy that had been stuck there for a very long time.  Then Amy shared a beautiful heart meditation with everyone.  We all chose a stone that she had brought for us to use and we placed it on our hearts.  As we were lying down Amy read us a meditation with poems in it that she had written herself.  The idea was to release any pain that we were holding in our hearts into the stone.  Again my personal experience was amazing!  I could feel pain leave my heart and move into the stone.  There was such positive responses from those who experienced the meditation also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether you have a technique to share to heal others, or something to share with us to help us heal ourselves or just want to come and meet great people and learn something new for yourself, please join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I invite you to bring a towel or a yoga mat to lie on the floor or anything else that will make you feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a DVD player available to us if needed, please just let me know in advance so I can have it in the room if needed.  I can also bring a CD player if that is needed.  Again, just please let me know since I have to bring that from home.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk down the spiral staircase.
