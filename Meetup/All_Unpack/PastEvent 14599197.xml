<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Judy and I changed the day to  this Sunday the 5th for Hanks Dairy Bar in Plainfield, Conn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be about 180 Miles round trip.  We could make a few more miles on it if we add in Woodstock, Conn.  They have a good apple orchard there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The web link to Hanks is   &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/pages/http%3A//www.hanksdairybar.com"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hanksdairybar.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hanksdairy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out their menu or entertainment that will be there that day.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can meet at 9:30  and leave at 10:00.  We will take a little highway, then head for the secondary roads.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought Sunday would be a better travel day as this is a long weekend, thinking Sat and Mon would be the busiest....... So.... Sunday it is for Women on Wheels to Hanks.......&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary H </member_name><member_id>8947310</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283795564000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Bikers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels</urlname><id>1366699</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>South Shore Women On WheelsÂ®</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283219752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hanks Dairy Bar in Plainfield, Conn.</name><id>14599197</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283693400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Women-on-Wheels/events/14599197/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/b/global_9177195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
