<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:  So far, there are 3 people planning to camp...with 3 tents.  That means anyone else will need to book another site!  Please update your RSVPs accordingly.  I am at Site 22...last I checked there will still sites available; if you get one near 22, all the better!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camp and hike in Franconia Notch!  I have booked site 22 at Lafayette Campgrounds for Saturday and Sunday nights, September 25 - 27.  I would love to have someone share the site (my finances are in sad shape!)   There are still quite a few other sites open - including site 21.  Up to 6 adults can be at one site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/Lafayette_Campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?page=details&amp;amp;contractCode=NH&amp;amp;parkId=270044&amp;amp;topTabIndex=CampingSpot" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.reserveame...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to hike Lonesome Lake on Saturday (the trail goes right through the campground!) and hopefully the Bridal Veil Falls on Sunday.  These are posted as separate events.  You don't have to do the hikes to come share the campsite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lafayette isn't as rustic as some campgrounds, but the location is excellent and the campsite is well-maintained.  And the leaves should just be starting to turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at Site 22.
