 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Join us at our own BBQ for the holidays. We're going to a western BBQ at LongHorn Steakhouse. Come on out and savor the western flavor.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;LongHorn welcomes guests into a warm, relaxing atmosphere reminiscent of a Western rancher&amp;rsquo;s home where friendly, attentive servers help them unwind and savor a great steakhouse meal.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;For over 29 years, LongHorn Steakhouse has proudly served steaks, chicken and fish that are always fresh, never frozen. Known for its passion for grilling inspired by the American West, their steaks include the signature hand-seasoned Flo&amp;rsquo;s Filet and the bone-in Outlaw Ribeye. And there&amp;rsquo;s more on the menu than just great steaks, like expertly grilled fresh fish and fresh chicken. Enjoy specialties such as LongHorn Salmon, a fresh, hand-cut salmon fillet seasoned with a bourbon marinade; fall-off-the-bone tender Baby Back Ribs; and Parmesan Crusted Chicken, two juicy chicken breasts grilled and topped with a parmesan cheese and garlic crust.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Hmmm...I'm feelin' pretty western already!!! Let's have a rippin' good time and start the holiday off with a bang! See you at the ranch, pardner!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Terri, Chuck,  or the Meetup sign...cell is 203-808-5829</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>chuck</member_name><member_id>11483387</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309695715000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306470162000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Go West, Young Man (and Woman) @ LongHorn Steakhouse!</name><id>19921821</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309561200000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/19921821/</event_url></item>
