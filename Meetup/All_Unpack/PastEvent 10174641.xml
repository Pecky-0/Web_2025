Personally I never thought I'd like this type of music but I went to see them a few years ago and have always enjoyed them since.   So be open minded and come check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Chicken Slacks show is always a great time as they'll get you moving, not only with their rousing covers of songs we all know, but also with great songs you never heard of as well as their own original material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out The Chicken Slacks web site: &lt;a href="http://www.chickenslacks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Chicken Slacks Official Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS:&lt;br /&gt;The cover at Johnny D's is usually in the $8-$15 range.  I expect the cover for this show to be $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you come to the show, I do wander around and look for folks (so it really helps if you posted a good picture of yourself).  I won't, however, be looking for those with RSVP of Maybe so you'll have to look for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're driving to the show, note that there are street parking spots, but they may be difficult to find.  Johnny D's has a good city parking map here:  &lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/parking.html" target="_blank"&gt;Parking Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're taking the T, the Davis Square Red Line stop is directly across the street from Johnny D's.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See my photo</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tim</member_name><member_id>3305855</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240192658000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239637172000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chicken Slacks At Johnny D's</name><id>10174641</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240019100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/10174641/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/1/global_8137809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
