Something that might be of interest is the opening of a life-size  walk-through replica of Anne Frank's house in Amsterdam where she wrote her famous diary.  The Charter Oak Cultural Center, 21 Charter Oak Ave in Hartford (a historic landmark and former synagogue) is holding an opening reception for it on October 4th at 5:30.  This is the same night as our Kaffeeklatsch with plenty of time to get to both. Make an evening of cultural event-hopping with your German-speaking friends!&lt;br /&gt; (There is also in the same building an opening of an exhibit of wedding canopies).&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you plan to stop by Charter Oak(5:30-6:45) so I can help the staff know how many people to expect..  If you've never been, it is one the coolest and most interesting places in Hartford or anywhere!!&lt;br /&gt;Dianne&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>3815102</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191713030000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Deutsch speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-425</urlname><id>438488</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6900024414</group_lon><name>The West Hartford German Kaffeeklatsch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189431205000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kaffeeklatsch(optional  Anne Frank's House)</name><id>6329910</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191539700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-425/events/6329910/</event_url></item>
