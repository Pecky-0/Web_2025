The movie is showing upstairs, so I will grab a table by the windows at the top of the escalator.  If you get there before me, please grab a table.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have closed the poll on the movie for the 18th and it was a tie between Tron and How Do You Know.   I was really expected to see a strong preference, one way or the other.   So I am going to have to break the tie and I would rather see the romantic comedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we will gather in the hallway to discuss the movie a bit, allow for restroom breaks and get a head count for those interested in going out for a bite to eat.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: December 17, 2010 &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Columbia Pictures (Sony) &lt;br /&gt;Director: James L.
