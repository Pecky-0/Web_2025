If not:  get working... there's &lt;i&gt;plenty&lt;/i&gt; of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, after it's too late on Sunday, I believe a few of us ought to get together on some comfortable couches upstairs at the Portland Public Market House at 28 Monument Square for a less formal meeting.  They serve local food &amp;amp; drink, and have free wifi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've a more formal meetup in the works for a few weeks from now, which I'll be announcing relatively soon,  but this one will be a chance to get acquainted and discuss a variety of Apple brand programming issues/ideas, but with natural lighting and without a projector or guard kicking us out (oops: they too close at 5pm). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does sound like a kind of meeting you might like to attend, but the time isn't good, let me know when works better and I might be able to change it or add another.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see some of you there. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be on or about the couches toward the back of the second floor.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Reeves</member_name><member_id>4215226</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332651979000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>interested parties</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-iPhone-Developers-Network</urlname><id>1454525</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine iOS Developer Network  (iPhone/iPad)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269296795000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A less formal meetup</name><id>12961292</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269799200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-iPhone-Developers-Network/events/12961292/</event_url></item>
