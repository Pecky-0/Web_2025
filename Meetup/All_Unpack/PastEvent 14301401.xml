I have not had a Meetup here yet because it only takes 30 - 45 minutes to complete the walk.  Thus, with a 7:17 sunset we will be having one Meetup with two different walks - both a very short drive from one another.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at Elm Bank parking lot C at 5:30.  At 5:40 we begin the beautiful walk.  Three sides of Elm Bank are surrounded by the Charles River.  Thus most of the walk is along itâ€™s scenic banks.  There are amazing lush green woods with lots of ferns on one side and the river with wet meadows on the other side of the walking trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After enjoying Elm Bank we will do a short drive and continue our walk near the western entrance of the Brook Path (on Leighton Road at the intersection of Dover Road).  The path is paved or well conditioned dirt and is popular for both pedestrians and bicyclists.  It follows Caroline and Fuller Brooks in a quiet area away from major streets.  We will follow it for about a half hour and then take light side streets back.  It will be an amazing late summer walk!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283992231000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Walkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Evening-Walkers</urlname><id>865474</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Evening Walkers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280815095000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Elm Bank and Brook Path in Wellesley - Fast Paced Workout and Beautiful Walk</name><id>14301401</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283463000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Evening-Walkers/events/14301401/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/3/global_16929155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
