Perfect for gift shopping, you can pick up hand made soap, inexpensive art, organic handmade T shirts, or a tin can cut out to look like a decorative lantern.  (note, the fair is secular, its not run by the church so there's no religious parphenilia like Jesus statues or rosarys for sale:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to gather at Crazy Doughs in Harvard Square (in the Garage) to pregame on pizza and beer/soda, then walk over to the fair. For those so inclined, there's many other places in the square to go shopping for unique gifts afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;Shameless plug, since I'm also running our Frog Pond skating charity event raising money to fufill a wish list for a formerly homeless woman's new apartment through &lt;a href="http://www.ontherise.org" target="_blank"&gt;On the Rise&lt;/a&gt;, I will be welcoming donations at this event also!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be inside, Crazy Dough's is lofted above the main entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess M</member_name><member_id>7718913</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291573069000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290467058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harvard Square Holiday Fair---and Lunch before</name><id>15530303</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291482000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/15530303/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
