Here is a little description from the Hartford Courant:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Brix is a term used in measuring the sugar content of wine grapes at the time of harvest. This restaurant is one sweet find. The look is casually chic. The food is exciting: squid with more legs than a Rockette's kickline, a roasted rack of lamb so good you nibble the bones, osso bucco plated with falling-apart lushness, and duck breast annointed with honey and served with wild rice and roasted pear.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner entrees cost anywhere from $8.50 to $26.00.   &lt;br /&gt;Again, please be mindful of your RSVPs.  Our events are usually full so if you RSVP and do not attend, you most likely took the spot of someone else who wanted to go but couldn't.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191868635000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189701217000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>French Cuisine at Brix Restaurant</name><id>6352171</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191452400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/6352171/</event_url></item>
