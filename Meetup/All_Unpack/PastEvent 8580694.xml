By the end of October, we'll need the chuckle, no matter what we believe is the right choice for each of the elections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Hall is back with his posse of punsters in this updated look at the elections which are only a few weeks from the show date! The Follies will be presenting custom-written songs and skits, while comic Frank O'Donnell, impressionists John Roarke and Ron Hayden, along with WPRO'S John DePetro and NBC-10's Gene Valicenti take their own personal pokes at the local and national election scene and we promise other comedy/celebrity surprises. Tix are $15 and $20- but please note: $5 OF EVERY TICKET WILL GO TO THE STATION MEMORIAL FOUNDATION- AND WILL BE MATCHED BY ALAN SHAWN FEINSTEIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order the tickets so we can be sure sit together as a group and collect money.  No Maybe's.  Cutoff date of 10/13 so that I can order the tickets.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at Theater Will Call at 7Pm...if you need a ride, let me know!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225062737000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219194837000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ocean State Follies: CamPAIN 2008</name><id>8580694</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224889200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/8580694/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
