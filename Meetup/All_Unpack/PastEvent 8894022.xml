If you want to show your support then come to this first meeting! First meetings are where much is decided about what the group is about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone interested in Warren Buffett or Benjamin Graham-based investing is invited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the entrance doors of MIT's Stata Center at 6:30pm.  Specifically, the meeting point is the entrance to Building 32 (also known as the Gates Building) on Main Street and Vassar Street.  The entrance doors are shown in the first 7 seconds of this video: &lt;a href="http://techtv.mit.edu/file/38/" target="_blank"&gt;http://techtv.mit.edu...&lt;/a&gt; . We will then use one of the rooms in the Stata Center.  &lt;b&gt;The doors are only accessible with an MIT card, so please arrive on time. Note that the start time is 6:30.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a &lt;a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?selection=32" target="_blank"&gt;campus map showing the Stata Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Agenda&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introductions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stockpicks and analysis: go through about 5 companies, 10 minutes each, looking at balance sheets and income statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is obvious from the agenda that sources will be shared of balance sheets and income statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are welcome to suggest the tickers for stock picks in your RSVP or at the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug Roberts</member_name><member_id>856777</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224461061000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Investor$ who think 4 themselve$</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonIBD</urlname><id>81154</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Investor's Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223119420000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Value Investing Group</name><id>8894022</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224109800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonIBD/events/8894022/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/9/global_4808969.jpeg</photo_url></item>
