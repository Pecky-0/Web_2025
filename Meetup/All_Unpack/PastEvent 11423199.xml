We will make several pies and fall desserts and would welcome any additions- pie, pie accessories, and the like. This is a good opportunity to socialize with fellow nonbelievers and venture off the beaten path and into the suburbs of Boston...scary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a mile away from both Quincy Center and Wollaston T stops on the Red Line and would be more than happy to arrange pick-ups if anyone needs it. For drivers, our apartment is close to 93 and parking is very easy and available on the street parallel to ours, Bailey Street. Email or call if you need more specific directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Yellow two family house, we're on the second floor.
