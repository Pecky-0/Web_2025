Last year, each time this group has partied at Johnny D's I've placed it on the &lt;a href="http://portuguese.meetup.com/316/calendar/12414412/"&gt;Portuguese &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonOnyxbirds/calendar/12636620"&gt;Onyxbirds&lt;/a&gt; Meetup calendars because it always exceeded expectation. Let's pack the place because the more the merrier and also your presence will help change the future parties to an earlier start time. It is well worth a little less sleep on a Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil is a 12-piece percussion ensemble that always puts on a spectacular show combining traditional Brazilian grooves like Samba and Ax√© with Funk, Rock, Jazz and even Hip Hop; add to this explosive mix of sultry vocals of Ju Marciano and three beautiful dancers and you got a recipe for FUN, Brazilian style!! Bring your dance shoes or socks and leave your worries at the door!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your friends....I guarantee a funtastic time, that is if you like your music strong and your party loud. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get there when you can. Don't be shy...Say hi, to the friendly folks seated in the dining area at the tables to the right of the stage up the stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Johnny's D's &lt;u&gt;kitchen closes at 7:30PM&lt;/u&gt; so you're not be able to order any food during the show.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must be at least 21&lt;/b&gt; but you don't have to drink, just enjoy each others company and an AMAZING! show.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:30 PM &lt;b&gt;FREE&lt;/b&gt; Samba and Brazilian Afro Dance Class &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the drumming, singing and dancing start, group conversation is difficult. Let's just enjoy the party!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 cash cover charge at the door &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.afrobrazil.org/index.php?CLm=10&amp;amp;CLd=11&amp;amp;CLy=2009&amp;amp;c_num=AB"&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil details&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/menu_drinks.html"&gt;Johnny D's drinks&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER - THANK YOU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/parking.html"&gt;Map of Nearby Municiple Parking Lots&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Cambridge (Harvard Square):  &lt;br /&gt;From Harvard Square travel north on Massachusetts Avenue and pass the porter Square T-Station and the Porter Square Shopping Center on the right.
