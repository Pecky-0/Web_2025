The lights are wonderful. I have not been this year yet (I'm not sure when they set them up. My guess is they are up now) but it has never been a disappointment in past years. It's best if you turn your headlights off when driving up the drive (leave on parking lights). You can just drive through or park up top and wander around enjoying the lights and taking a few photos. If you want refreshments before or after there is a little restaurant/bar (the name escapes me at the moment) on the green in South Royalton. Just something different worth mentioning. If anyone wants to meet-up to do this together we can set a date. Otherwise, hope you visit and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael, I would have set the date for Wednesday (wing night) but the weather is not looking so good for Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can meet at the Park N Ride in Sharon off Exit 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325041166000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323122476000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christmas Lights &amp; Refreshments</name><id>43492452</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324422000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/43492452/</event_url></item>
