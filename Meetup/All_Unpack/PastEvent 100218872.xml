&lt;p&gt;The poll this month was a clear winner again! With 11 votes, On Basilisk Station by David Weber was your pick for the book club!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;INTRODUCING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;HONOR HARRINGTON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;"Having made him look a fool, she's been exiled to Basilisk Station in disgrace and set up for ruin by a superior who hates her.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Her demoralized crew blames her for their ship's humiliating posting to an out-of-the-way picket station.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;The aborigines of the system's only habitable planet are smoking homicide-inducing hallucinogens.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Parliament isn't sure it wants to keep the place; the major local industry is smuggling; the merchant cartels want her head; the star-conquering, so-called "Republic" of Haven is Up To Something; and Honor Harrington has a single, over-age light cruiser with an armament that doesn't work to police the entire star system.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;But the people out to get her have made one mistake. They've made her mad."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the e-book for free through the &lt;a href="http://www.baenebooks.com/p-304-on-basilisk-station.aspx"&gt;publisher&lt;/a&gt; and also from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Basilisk-Station-Honor-Harrington-ebook/dp/B00ARPJBS0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1358518473&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=on+basilisk+station"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones and across the street from Orleans restaurant. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Josh&lt;/p&gt;
