The most efficient way to reach them is through automated calling with a strong message on why Ron Paul is the better candidate. &lt;a href="http://ronpaul-convention08.com"&gt;Please donate TODAY to this effort!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A direct mail campaign, targeting  200,000 voters on the March 4th primary  (Ohio, 88 delegates; RI, 20 delegates; Texas, 140 delegates; and Vermont, 17 delegates) will cost approximately $50,000. These funds will also support ongoing outreach radio and ad efforts in those states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second target date for us is April 5 when with your help we will capture  22 uncommitted Massachusetts delegates at the caucuses for Ron Paul in this state. We will target Republican supporters with newspaper ads and phone calls at an estimated cost of $25,000. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Meetup events are independent efforts and not a part of the official campaign or any associated PAC and so the FEC limit of $2300 does not apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help fund these and other important outreach projects to promote Ron Paul by &lt;a href="http://ronpaul-convention08.com"&gt;credit card&lt;/a&gt; now. With your help he will win the nomination!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224270892000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202602462000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Onto the National Convention in September! </name><id>7299676</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220310000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/7299676/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/8/global_3178920.jpeg</photo_url></item>
