<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I am planning a multi event that includes a beautiful hike and a birthday celebration for our fearless Indiana Skee organizer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is a thru hike in Durham.  We will meet at the parking area for the Rockland Preserve on rt. 79 in Madison at 10:00.  There is plenty of parking at that location.  We will shuttle folks up to the starting point on Pisgah Rd.  This hike has ups and downs with lots of rocks and beautiful views along the cliffs.  We will pass the Pyramid which is a huge glacial anomaly and Selectman's Stones that marks the Durham, Madison, and Guilford boarders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is no more than 6 miles.  We will start the hike at 10:30 and should finish no later than 2:30.  You need sturdy boots, water, and snacks.  It is spring so expect mud, bugs (bring spray), and sun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the hike, a member of the hiking group has offered their home near by for a pot luck birthday party.  Please bring items to grill and share.  There will be yard games and a fire later (if Al brings his usual gear).  The gathering is to celebrate Kevin's birthday.  Please come enjoy good food and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rockland Preserve Parking area is across from Samantha Court on Route 79 in Madison, CT&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Madison&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=%5B1-99%5D+Samantha+Ln&amp;amp;zipcode=06443&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.42345&amp;amp;longitude=-72.65075&amp;amp;geocode=STREET" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
