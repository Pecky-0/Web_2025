I can’t wait to share it with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;This evening we’ll do two guided meditations to relax and feel expanded Love and Spirit.  We’ll also be doing a process to connect you to your inner wisdom by traveling through time to your future, wise, old self!  It’s called the Sage Advice Process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise you, you will leave feeling deeply relaxed, nurtured and enveloped in loving energy, and feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please join us!  The more people we have, the better the collective energy and experience. I love doing this with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome. &lt;u&gt;This is a public event.&lt;/u&gt; The class is appropriate whether you are a beginner to meditating, or experienced.  &lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please invite others to sign up and join you.  Forward this to your friends, family and groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big thank you to Wayland Wellness for co-sponsoring this evening with us!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;“Ann’s guided meditation was heavenly.  With a soothing voice and joyful manner, Ann skillfully guided me, and a room full of others, to a place of happiness.  For me it was sheer joy.  After having been gently guided to experience absolute physical and mental relaxation, I experienced one of the most profoundly powerful moments I have felt because I was able to access pure love and joy.  I am grateful to Ann for her gentle and loving manner and her skill and dedication.   I look forward to working with her again and again. “ Renee J.
