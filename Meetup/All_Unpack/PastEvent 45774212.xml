The NH Animal Rights League (NHARL) is providing the Occupy NH Primary people with some vegan food to promote the vegan message. We will be doing this Jan 7, 8, 9, and maybe 10. If you'd like to sit down and share vegan food on any of those dates, or all of them, please come with your potluck dish to share with everyone. Hours are 2pm until 5pm. The occupiers will be eating free and the NHARL is donating some money and product to this effort. No alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need more info or would like to volunteer more of your time to set up or clean up please send me an email and thanks so much everyone. lindld@comcast.net&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for ladies with black very noticeable Vegan T Shirts</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Dionne</member_name><member_id>6923926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326231709000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325113495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bring a hearty vegan casserole, soup, or chilli to feed 8-10 people</name><id>45774212</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325962800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/45774212/</event_url></item>
