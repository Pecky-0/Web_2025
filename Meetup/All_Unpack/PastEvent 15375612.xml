Because these events are so close together we will have them on the same day. We have reserved Room 1 at the Marion Gerrish Community Center &lt;a href="http://mgccderrynh.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://mgccderrynh.or...&lt;/a&gt;   in Derry, NH at 39 East Broadway for November 13. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NHARL member meeting will begin at 11:30 am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vegan meetup/Gentle Thanksgiving Vegan Potluck will begin at 2 pm until 4:30 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup members, NHARL members and non-members, are welcome to attend one or both of these events. Please RSVP for the vegan potluck so we can coordinate what everyone will be bringing. We want to have traditional Thanksgiving food, except for the dead bird, of course, and no animal products whatsoever. Thus far we have mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, one dessert, and tofurky. Reply to this email to let us know what you will be bringing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Marion Gerrish does allow alcohol so BYOB (bring your own beverage) if you want. Coffee and tea will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please contact Linda or me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kindest Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve</member_name><member_id>7631884</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365646527000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289195143000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday, November 13, Gentle Thanksgiving Celebration - Vegan Potluck</name><id>15375612</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289674800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/15375612/</event_url></item>
