If anyone did not order one and would like one, please contact me at blacklab08022@comcast.net. You can look at the past meetups to see the details.&lt;/strong&gt; I was thinking maybe we can meet up in the parking lot at Livingston Park in Manchester on Tuesday, June 26th at 6 pm. If this doesn't work, I can also meetup on Wed. the 27th or Thurs. the 28th. How does everyone feel about that? I will set it for the 26th, but will work with whomever can't make that date.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340935451000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339984864000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Delivery of T-shirts and Sweatshirts</name><id>69605622</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340748000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/69605622/</event_url></item>
