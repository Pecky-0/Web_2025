&lt;p&gt;PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE&amp;nbsp;EVENT ANNOUNCEMENT!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is for the suburban Natives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives have been organizing Patriots Game Watching Events over the past&amp;nbsp;4 months with&amp;nbsp;up to&amp;nbsp;65 people attending&amp;nbsp;at Boston, Wakefield&amp;nbsp;and Woburn venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we will&amp;nbsp;return to&amp;nbsp;our&amp;nbsp;suburban venue on Sunday&amp;nbsp;February 5&amp;nbsp;at 5:30 pm to watch the Patriots&amp;nbsp;play in the&amp;nbsp;Super Bowl.&amp;nbsp;We watched the&amp;nbsp;AFC Championship Game at&amp;nbsp;Harrington's on&amp;nbsp;January 22 and polled our guests with many&amp;nbsp;being open to returning for the Super Bowl.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great and the full menu will be available for purchase. Owners Lisa and Dan have offerred us&amp;nbsp;the entire first floor bar and restaurant area and are adding an additional 60 inch television screen for&amp;nbsp;the Super Bowl. Harrington's will provide some complimentary appetizers&amp;nbsp;as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive early&amp;nbsp;and get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Time is 6:30pm&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's in front of Bank of America and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center. And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station&amp;nbsp;via the&amp;nbsp;Haverhill Train stopping at Wakefield Station&amp;nbsp;with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion&amp;nbsp;Street, right on&amp;nbsp;to Main Street and 1 block to Water Street. If you are joining us from the City this is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink.&amp;nbsp;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER AND TIP YOUR SERVERS!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please&amp;nbsp;RSVP early if you think you can attend. Invite, guests, friends, and co-workers.&amp;nbsp;We are&amp;nbsp;inviting several&amp;nbsp;other groups to join us so space&amp;nbsp;will become limited. Let's have as many Natives there as possible and take over Harrington's!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*****Due to the constant large number number of "No Shows" we are limiting members to RSVP with only 1 guest and reserve the right to further limit members who have more than 1 No Show. We have been taking attendance. To better insure entry to the event we suggest that&amp;nbsp;any potential guests join the Red Sox Natives meetup. Wait listed people for our January 22 event&amp;nbsp;were unable to attend because of all the RSVP No Shows.*****&lt;/p&gt;
