You will most certainly find someone to play with (or against) regardless of your skill level.  The idea is to have fun while getting some exercise.  Meeting new and interesting people has also been know to happen on these very courts.  Hopefully the weather will cooperate.  Bringing water is advisable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conard is very easy to get to.  If anyone has questions or comments, please feel free to contact me at 860-559-7983.  There is a slight chance I might be a few minutes. I look forward to seeing you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my profile picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210906278000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>It'll be good, clean and healthy fun.</why><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210195587000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis - Correct Date is May 10</name><id>7893738</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210428000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/7893738/</event_url></item>
