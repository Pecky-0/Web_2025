We had dinner here last February and 23 people attended, with good reviews, if you check our past meet-up pages. Price ranges are: Salads $9-11, Antipasti $12-16, Pasta $17-28, Entrees $20-36. The portions are large. We'll begin the evening with an hour of mingling in the rear of the lounge from 6:00-7:00. At 6:30, a pianist plays live. After dinner, we'll cross the street and have coffee and dessert at Caffe Paradiso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is located on the left side of Hanover St. as you come from the Greenway, about 2 blocks down. Please bring cash, if possible, as we won't get separate checks. Twenty-five percent will be added for tax and tip. RSVP's accepted immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299543548000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296513657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ristorante Fiore-Dinner</name><id>16388491</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296864000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/16388491/</event_url></item>
