&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Register at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ctreia.com%2Fevents.php%3Fa%3Dr%26i%3D513&amp;amp;h=fAQEU3w5x&amp;amp;s=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ctreia.com/events.php?a=r&amp;amp;i=513&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Whether you are a brand new student, or have been with me for years, I hope you know how committed I am to your success. But one thing puzzles me ... why some students have massive success ... and others never get started.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

On this Thursday, I will be interviewing my good friend Linda Baumgarten of the CT REIA and The Ultimate Life Company. Over the past 9 years, she has gotten up close and personal to real estate investing trainers and speakers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

And she has discovered the Behind-the-Curtains secret that all your favorite teachers know... but they haven't shared with you. In fact, Linda says they may be mad when she reveals this Key to you. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

So on Thursday, she will be pulling back the curtains ... not only TELLING you but SHOWING you. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Have you been struggling to get your business off the ground? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps you've had a modicum of success but just can't get any momentum. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Maybe you've bought every course (including mine!) under the sun but you still can't make any money! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Join me on Thursday January 3rd at 8:00 pm EST for a short 45 minute burst of inspiration!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
