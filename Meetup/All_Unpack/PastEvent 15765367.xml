My biased opinion is that he is the next Jack Johnson/John Mayer. Below is his website and career description. Will schedule a meetup if there is enough interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.joshuaradin.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://us.joshuaradin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joshua Radin is an American recording artist, songwriter and actor. Born and raised in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He studied drawing and painting at Northwestern University, following his college years with stints as an art teacher, screenwriter, and art gallery employee. He turned to music when he moved to New York City, bought a guitar, and taught himself to play and write music. In 2004, American actor Zach Braff used Radin's first composition, &amp;quot;Winter,&amp;quot; scoring Radin a scene in the hit television series Scrubs. Soon after, Radin's songs were heard on TV shows such as Grey's Anatomy, Brothers and Sisters, American Idol, One Tree Hill, among others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$20.00 - GA Standing Room Advance&lt;br /&gt;$22.00 - GA Standing Room Day of Show&lt;br /&gt;$30.00 - Reserved Seating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BUY YOUR OWN TICKETS at House of Blues &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.houseofblues.com/tickets/searchresults.php?venue=boston" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.houseofblu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>vaibhav</member_name><member_id>10494016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297698498000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292683254000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Concert of Joshua Radin with Justin Nozuka, Andrew Allen at House of Blues</name><id>15765367</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297551600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/15765367/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/d/global_8294813.jpeg</photo_url></item>
