As many of you know, Bernie has been helping people for years to reconnect with the joy of their inner spirit and find opportunities for self healing. In 1978 he founded &amp;quot;Exceptional Cancer Patients&amp;quot; to provide safe, loving, therapeutic &amp;quot;carefrontation&amp;quot; to those struggling with cancer. He's touched thousands of lives around the world and has made enormous contributions to patient empowerment. You can read more at his website, &lt;a href="http://www.berniesieg..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.berniesieg...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Thursday, February 17 at 7 pm, he will present an evening of &amp;quot;Love, Medicine, and Miracles.&amp;quot; This is a wonderful chance to spend some time with an amazing healer, hear his stories of compassion and inspiration, and ask questions in an intimate group environment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $20 and we are limiting this to only 75 attendees, so it's a first come first serve basis. You can reserve a seat online by visiting www.learn.edu/events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm wishes, &lt;br /&gt;Leslie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leslie </member_name><member_id>10725866</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298043079000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293032687000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dr. Bernie Siegel Presents An Evening of "Love, Medicine, and Miracles"</name><id>15798623</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297987200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/15798623/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/e/c/global_20416844.jpeg</photo_url></item>
