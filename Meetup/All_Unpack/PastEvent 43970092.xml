A hard days work on the campaign trail couldn&amp;#146;t be better capped off than with fellow Ron Paul Supporters, a light case of frostbite, wa...rm food, cold drink, and the dream of victory. You can help us make that happen. We&amp;#146;d like to sponsor an event in New Hampshire so that we can all come together after a long week of knocking on doors and passing out literature. We need to raise $5000.00 to provide the grassroots sponsorship. Here are the details: When: Saturday, January 7, 2012 at 11:00am until Sunday, January 8, 2012 at 1:00am Where: Jillian&amp;#146;s Billiards Club of Manchester 50 Phillippe Cote Street Manchester, New Hampshire 03101 (603) 626-7636 THIS IS IT! Everything we&amp;#146;ve been working for will come down to New Hampshire. We need all the people we can get to come to New Hampshire and help campaign for Ron Paul. We&amp;#146;ll also be throwing a huge debate watch party which will include great speakers/performers and FREE food! Special Speakers / Performers Tom Woods Jordan Page Golden State More details will be announced as we get closer to the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1325988674000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323468573000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RevolutionPAC's Boots On the Ground/Debate Party</name><id>43970092</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325984400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/43970092/</event_url></item>
