These are friendship tournament event meetups that are reverse coed doubles matches played in a King-Queen format, meaning that you will be playing with and against different people during pool play. Top players after pool play will compete in a playoff format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a friendship tournament format, meaning call your own faults, as there are no referees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be using the ruleset listed in the first post on the following URL: &lt;a href="http://volleyball.meetup.com/122/messages/boards/thread/8548572"&gt;http://volleyball.mee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The events will start at 10:30 AM and will likely last at least until the mid afternoon (~3 PM). If you would like to play in this event you must commit to staying at least through the end of pool play. Remember to bring snacks/food and water/beverages, as this event will involve a significant amount of volleyball play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is intended for players with experience playing reverse coed doubles format. Signup for these events is a little different.

Preference is given to AA/A/BB players who sign up in male/female pairs, although some single signups will be allowed. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274648163000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273965047000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Advanced Outdoor (Grass) QK RevCoed Doubles Volleyball</name><id>13494662</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274625000000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/13494662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/3/global_1997523.jpeg</photo_url></item>
