I know my collection is not a cool as Donna's but hey, it's not too shabby :) We'll knit and order pizza :)  I'm thinking like from 11 am to 3 pm ish this Saturday April 1, 2006, and we'll order the pizza around noon ish once we've decided what we want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I'm not comfortable with pasting directions and my address on the net, RSVP or email me if you're coming and I'll send you directions and my phone number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you Saturday hopefully :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>1774915</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1144080311000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Knitters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>knitting-486</urlname><id>179362</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Concord Knitting Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1143554458000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Knitting Potluck at Denise's Apartment</name><id>4887001</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1143907200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/knitting-486/events/4887001/</event_url></item>
