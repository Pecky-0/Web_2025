We need a large showing of opposition to this plan as each city that signs on is used to leverage other towns and cities to sign on. If we can turn it back in Rochester that will aide other communities to do the same. We must win this. Please call Rochester's Mayor TJ Jean (603.332.8876) and urge him to vote against Granite State Future also do the same with Rochester City Councilor Ray Varney (603.332.2661) It is important that you are polite and civil in your conversations. Your conversation should be short urging them not to support passage of Granite State Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semper Fi,&lt;/p&gt;
