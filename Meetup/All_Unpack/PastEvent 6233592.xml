Many of you met Dustin at the Advanced Integral Workshop and expressed your interest in a more in depth exploration of Integral Religious Studies.  Dustin will be leading a discussion focusing on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Conveyor Belt as proposed in Integral Spirituality. What is it? Is it legit?  What might be key factors in determining the altitude of expression within a particular tradition? Examples?  Teasing apart the multiple definitions of Enlightenment: What is enlightenment? Integral Enlightenment: What does it mean to be in union with a world of form that is evolving? How can we distinguish horizontal enlightenment from vertical enlightenment? What is the role of the Witness (aka. the no-self Self) in relation to peak experiences? If existence is truly non-dual, aren't we all always already enlightened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you all soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole Trudel Churchill</member_name><member_id>3348175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190507674000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187914849000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Ken Wilber Group September Meetup</name><id>6233592</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190330100000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/6233592/</event_url></item>
