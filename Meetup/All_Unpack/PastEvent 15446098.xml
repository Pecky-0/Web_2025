<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;EVENT:&lt;/b&gt; Join us in celebrating Chanukah! We'll be doing all of the fun things that made Chanukah your favorite Jewish holiday when you were a kid. We'll light the chanukia, say the blessings, and sing your favorite Chanukah songs. Of course we'll also eat the traditional holiday favorites, latkes and sufganiyot (jelly donuts) as well as other items like, cut up vegetables, cheese &amp;amp; crackers. Bring your own chanukia and candles for this 4th night of chanukah. We'll provide dreidels for those who want to spin... and winners can take home their accumulated gelt!&lt;br /&gt;RSVP: Mandatory by Wednesday December 1st. Party is at a private home in Newton; location and directions will be sent to registered attendees. Please consider bringing a non-perishable food or toiletry contribution for Family Table, greater Bostonâ€™s Jewish food pantry.
