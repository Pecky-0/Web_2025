Bring treats, toys, water, poop bags and be ready for a few laughs. See you at the park. WOOF. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****There is a short trail across the street from the park. (approx 1 1/2 miles) It takes Jack, Bella and me about 20-25 minutes. (Depending on how many squirrels Jack can find and chase) Since Bella needs a bit more exercise, we arrive at the park early and do this short hike. If anyone would like to join us, we would welcome the company. We'll be leaving the parking lot at 12:15 or so. Again, no stress, just a walk in the woods. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Out in the fields playing fetch....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jennifer</member_name><member_id>4251176</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228155388000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226795903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday at the park..</name><id>9170122</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227981600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/9170122/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/global_5898138.jpeg</photo_url></item>
