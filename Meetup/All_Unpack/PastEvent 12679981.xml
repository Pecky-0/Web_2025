It's a nice course and there's a great party with food and beer afterward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can download an application or register online. They allow you to register the day of the event as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the event gets closer I'll figure out a meeting place for before and after the race. It will probably be somewhere in the fenced in Parking area where the parking is.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the race time is 11:00am but we'll be meeting well before that time to warm up and get to the starting line.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>4878639</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271168811000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266893396000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doyle's 14th Annual Emerald Necklace Road Race</name><id>12679981</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270995300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/12679981/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
