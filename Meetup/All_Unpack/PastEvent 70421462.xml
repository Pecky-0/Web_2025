The beach is a natural mudflat with a wide sandy knoll along its three-mile length. From 1906 to 1975, Revere Beach contained a popular amusement park, that was considered by many to be Boston's Coney Island. During its hey-day in the 1920s, it was not unusual for 100,000 people to visit Revere Beach to swim, ride an amusement, or go to one of the famous dance halls that operated there for many years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #999999"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the 1980s, condominiums were constructed along Revere Beach, which marked the beginning of revitalization in the area. In 2004, the first New England Sand Sculpting Festival was held. The annual contest soon offered cash prizes, which attracted famous sculptors from all over the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #999999"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This yearâ€™s tournament will take place from Thursday July 12th to Sunday July 15th 2012, near the bandstand on Revere Beach Boulevard (between Beach Street and Shirley Avenue). &lt;span style="color : #272727"&gt;The meet-up is scheduled for Saturday July 14. The closest MBTA stop is Revere Beach Station on the Blue Line, which is located only one block away from the festival.&lt;/span&gt; Free parking is available along Ocean Avenue and Revere Beach Boulevard (review signs for time limits), as well as parking lots (fee) near Wonderland MBTA Station.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342301721000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340475932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>*Sand Sculpting Festival* &amp; *Fireworks Extravaganza* @ Revere Beach</name><id>70421462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342279800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/70421462/</event_url></item>
