<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>On January 14, we will be discussing Marley and Me. So, if you're an animal lover, want to relax with some great people over pizza and a beer, come on by. Then on January 18th, we're going to see the Marley and Me movie which hits theaters on Dec 25. We'll probably do a matinee since it's a Sunday and will choose a theater close to Manchester. Hope you'll join us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1235602166000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228446123000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club December Meetup</name><id>9284007</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231977600000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/9284007/</event_url></item>
