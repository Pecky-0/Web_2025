Please buy your tix AHEAD of time! I'm going to watch this regardless of people coming, but it's &amp;quot;funner&amp;quot; with people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts @7PM in an auditorium upstairs on the 2nd level. I'll fold a red meetup sign on a table, if I can grab one. Otherwise, I might have to hold it up like a chauffer awaiting VIP guests for a limousine =P. I'll be entering the auditorium @6:45PM to get good seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film ends, I'll be waiting near the very first row of the big screen with a red Meetup sign. The group often goes out afterwards and socialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS yes, we are featuring casey affleck this month ;). we all know you luv Boston-bred actors.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191883179000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191543120000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</name><id>6490910</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191709800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/6490910/</event_url></item>
