I'm scheduling the meetup in its 3rd weekend so people can use passes, and so we don't compete with Cowboys and Aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Story: Steve Carell and Julianne Moore are married. She wants a divorce. With the help of Ryan Gosling, he tries to win back his wife. And he dates Marisa Tomei. And Ryan Gosling dates Emma Stone. Kevin Bacon is in it too. He's teaching the town how to dance, I guess. Look, just watch the trailer. It's funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blackstone Valley Cinema has a showtime at 4:10 on Saturday. How about we meet in the lobby at 3:45? We can go somewhere for dinner afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my photo, but with a goatee</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1313285256000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311553512000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crazy Stupid Love</name><id>26893631</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313265600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/26893631/</event_url></item>
