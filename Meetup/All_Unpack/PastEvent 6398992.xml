It was another great meeting, this time focusing on the classic NLP technique known as Six-step Reframing.  We demonstrated the technique on a real problem, and then the group paired up to do 6-step reframes on each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For October: this month we?ll be working with Submodalities, one of the simplest and yet most powerful concepts in NLP.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every sensory modality (sight, hearing, feeling, taste and smell) has an infinite number of submodalities within it.  Examples of submodalities for sight are: image size, brightness, color versus black and white, and transparency.  For hearing, a few submodalities are: volume, direction, tone, and rhythm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What?s really interesting about submodalities is that by changing them, you change the experience associated with them.  For example, many people have found that by making an unpleasant visual memory partially transparent, they reduce the intensity of the memory (try it!).  Similarly, someone else may find that moving a ?critical voice? from the inside of their head to the outside completely transforms their reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be exploring our own and others submodalities, seeing what works best for each of us.  We?ll also be introducing the technique known as ?mapping across?, where we take whole groups of submodalities from one aspect of our experience and move them to other aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October?s NLP meetup does not depend on having attended any of the previous NLP meetups. It also does not presuppose that you know anything about NLP. Everyone is welcome, from beginners to experts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;Andover-Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
