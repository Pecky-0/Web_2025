In this class you will learn about basic stringing materials, tools (cutters, flat nose, round nose and crimp pliers) and crimping techniques to set the foundation for creating earrings, bracelets and necklaces. We will also cover simple loops to create a pair of coordinating earrings. You will leave with at least one completed project, a bracelet, using soft flex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dates:  Thursday, September 3 at 6:00pm or Saturday, September 12 at 1pm&lt;br /&gt;Duration: 1.5 hours&lt;br /&gt;Fee: $25 + cost of materials (starting as low as $4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact Abeille at 617.232.4343 to register.
