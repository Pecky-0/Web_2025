Today's 48-foot tower was built in 1878.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Friends of Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouse was founded in 2001 as a chapter of the American Lighthouse Foundation (ALF). Our mission is to work for the preservation of Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouse and associated structures, as well as to gather and preserve the history of this important historic site and to share these resources with the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Coast Guard owns Portsmouth Harbor Lighthouse and maintains the aids to navigation equipment. Our group is licensed through ALF to care for the tower, oil house, and wooden walkway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No reservations are needed; tours are on a first come, first served basis. No children under 42 inches tall are permitted to climb to the top, and adults are not permitted to carry children up the stairs. Visitors get to climb to the lantern room to enjoy the magnificent view and to see the fourth-order Fresnel lens up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volunteers will tell visitors about the history of the light station, and there will be souvenirs for sale. To climb the lighthouse, a donation of $2 for adults and $1 for children is suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 44 stairs to the watch room and a 7-rung ladder to the lantern room. Flat shoes (not sandals or flip-flops) are required to climb the ladder into the lantern room.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243876123000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
