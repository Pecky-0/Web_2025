There are &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; many to choose from:  P.F. Chang's, Aquitaine Bistrot, Met Bar and Grill, Legal Seafood or Bugaboo Creek.  We'll take in a movie starting around 4:00p and then head over to one of these yummy spots for either cocktails or a light dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet outside Studio 3 (the cafe inside the theatre adjacent to the ticket counter) at 3:30 to gather before the shows start and decide where to meet after the movies.  I will post movie selections the week before the Meetup as they will be more current.  We do not all have to see the same show, however it does make it easier to get together afterward if we see shows with similar times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on out everyone, this should be a fun afternoon/early evening...you too, south shore Baby Boomers! &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Outside the Studio 3 Cafe</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mindy</member_name><member_id>8014085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272397596000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267378202000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Afternoon at the Movies Plus.....</name><id>12733185</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272223800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/12733185/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/9/global_11148425.jpeg</photo_url></item>
