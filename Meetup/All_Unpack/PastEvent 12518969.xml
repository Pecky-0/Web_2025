They're going to set up three tables for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, meet up near the screen, right side, after the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the description from the Coolidge Corner website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nominated for 2 Academy Awards: Best Actress, Helen Mirren &amp;amp; Best Supporting Actor, Chritopher Plummer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This production, directed by Michael Hoffman, is like a great night at the theatre--the two performing demons go at each other full tilt and produce scenes of Shakespearean affection, chagrin, and rage. - David Denby, The New Yorker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost fifty years of marriage, the Countess Sofya (Helen Mirren), Leo Tolstoy’s (Christopher Plummer) devoted wife, passionate lover, muse and secretary suddenly finds her entire world turned upside down. In the name of his newly created religion, the great Russian novelist has renounced his noble title, his property and even his family in favor of poverty, vegetarianism and even celibacy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sofya then discovers that Tolstoy’s trusted disciple, Chertkov (PaulGiamatti) may have secretly convinced her husband to sign anew will, leaving the rights to his iconic novels to the Russian people rather than hisvery own family, she is consumed by righteous outrage. Into this minefield wanders Tolstoy’s worshipful new assistant, the young, gullible Valentin (James McAvoy). In no time, he becomes a pawn, first of the scheming Chertkov and then of the wounded, vengeful Sofya as each plots to undermine the other’s gains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dir.
