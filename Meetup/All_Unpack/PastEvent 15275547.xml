Founded sixteen years ago by Richard Lord, a former professional boxer, Lord’s welcomes people of all ages, races, ethnicities and social classes: men, women, children, doctors, lawyers, judges, business men and women, immigrants, professional boxers and people who want to become professional boxers train alongside amateurs who love the sport and teenagers who are trying to develop strength and assertiveness. Lord’s is an example of the American ‘melting pot’ where people meet, talk, and train. As is his usual technique, Wiseman allows the filmmaking to melt into the background, truly letting the people and the place speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From The New Yorker:&lt;br /&gt;The word that seems to crop up most often in the course of the film is “rhythm,” and Wiseman fills the screen with it. His eye for the diverse rites of training analyzes them to the choreographic and the contrapuntal, whether it’s pumping the medicine ball or pounding the heavy bag, jumping rope or practicing footwork, slugging tires with a sledgehammer or tattooing the speed bag. In probing tableaux composed with alluring depth of field, Wiseman often shows two or more athletes training at once (and captures their staccato polyrhythms on the sound track, which he recorded himself). There’s not a lot of hitting here; he clearly revels not in pugilistic combat but, rather, in the beauty of its discrete elements. The only serious fighting comes near the end, and a jolting cut from a lumbering battle in the ring to an elegant speed-bag session suggests that the competitive aspect of boxing is not only beside the point; it’s a degradation of the sport’s pure forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://New Yorker Review" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/boxing_gym_wiseman#ixzz13niChSci" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newyorker....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets can be purchased in advanced at &lt;a href="https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?e=b58bc15d3cd2c6f522f44ab456c91447&amp;amp;t=tix" target="_blank"&gt;Boxing Gym Tickets&lt;/a&gt;.
