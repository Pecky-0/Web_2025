Afterwards, we will give you a tour of our Common House which includes the kid's room, living room, Great Room, kitchen, mailroom, offices, rumpus room, laundry, and guest suite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, please bring a little something to share.  We look forward to getting to know you!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, if you haven't done so already, check out the cohousing.org website for information about the many communities in and around the US.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please come directly to the Common House across the yard.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane</member_name><member_id>6033522</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeney Bruce</member_name><member_id>6660138</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224421189000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cohousers &amp; Community Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CohousingNewEngland</urlname><id>1051028</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cohousing New England:Boston to Burlington/MA,ME,VT,NH,CT,NY</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213535983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at JP Cohousing</name><id>8146356</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218981600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CohousingNewEngland/events/8146356/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/d/9/global_3428009.jpeg</photo_url></item>
