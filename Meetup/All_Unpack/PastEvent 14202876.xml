Let's go check out up to 240 flea market vendors who can be found on any given week at Todd Farm. Merchandise varies from antique furniture, clocks, jewelery, recordings, and tools to fishing rods, golf accessories, honey products, cedar fencing, plants and flowers, vintage toys, etc. And the list goes on and on. It's the perfect New England way to spend some leisurely weekend time. You never know what you will find, so come on out and check it out. This is their 38th year of operation. There is always something new and exciting every weekend. Get here early, bring your family and friends. Be a part of the best flea market on the North Shore or peruse the shops where you will find treasures to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not able to find us or you are running later please call the meetup phone at: 978-304-2811&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING: Not sure where we will be parking this year but just follow the rest of the cars and the parking attendee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Go to: &lt;a href="http://www.toddsfarm...." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.toddsfarm....&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember, although we are there as a group, we will most likely get separated.
