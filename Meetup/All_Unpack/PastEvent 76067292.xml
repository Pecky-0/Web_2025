 Healer Share! We usually have Reiki in one room and Full Spectrum in the other room. Come on down and practice your healing. Give a healing and get one too! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Come on down and practice your techniques - we have a very diverse group of healers. In 2 hours, you'll get to experience the modalities above - plus others such as Shamanic, Quantum Touch, The Reconnection &amp;amp; Yuen Method to name a few - depending who shows up. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Don't gauge the number of attendees by the RSVP number, as we often have 15-30 people attending with 0 RSVP's.  If you would like to RSVP please click here....&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Metrowest-Reiki-Meetup-Group/events/calendar/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/The-Metrowest-Reiki-Meetup-Group/events/calendar/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Lisa Campion carried on this tradition for more than a decade. As Lisa steps aside quietly to pursue other interests, a few of us will maintain the Solstice Healer Share tradition of fun, friendship and bringing benefit to others. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This is by far the best share in the area. Thank you Lisa.&lt;/p&gt;
