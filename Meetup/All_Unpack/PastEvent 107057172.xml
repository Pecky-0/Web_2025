This FREE family friendly event celebrates the fourth year of the Discovered Spirit Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is for children and youth with any experience in Connecticut's Department of Children and Families, or the juvenile division of the Connecticut Department of Corrections. The project is intended to give them a voice by encouraging self-expression through art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words alone are not enough to express what children feel. This is especially true when they are faced with the complex issues of divorce, grief, violence, abuse, neglect or coping with poverty. We are giving a voice to these children to express a wide range of emotions and help them work through conflicts and traumas. We expect to see an array of outcomes with our masks from the whimsical to the evocative. While expressing themselves in this visual way, the children gain a sense of empowerment that can help them develop a positive self-image and improve their self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again Southport Galleries has opened it space for the reception on March 10, 2013 from 4 to 6pm. Our goal is to bring broader awareness of Covenant to Care for Children and the children we serve, offer an opportunity at recognition and accomplishment to the children participating, and build support of our programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masks are part of a juried show displayed at Southport Galleries in Fairfield County. Judges include: CT Department of Children &amp;amp; Families Commissioner Joette Katz, CT Representative Tony Hwang, Natalie Holder-Winfield, Esq., and Diann Cook, artist, author and former Discovered Spirit Project Committee Chair. During the reception, the judges will present awards for the masks showing the greatest originality, presentation, and representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hosted wine and juice bar along with catering from Delamar's Artisan restaurant rounds out the afternoon. Please join us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363005610000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362150526000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>discovered spirit project artists' reception</name><id>107057172</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1362945600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/107057172/</event_url></item>
