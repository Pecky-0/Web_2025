They will be learning about nature and also drumming with Steve.  We will also be doing some work with the pendulums.  If they do not know how to use a pendulum, no worries, we will teach them!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP as to whether you will be able to help with this remarkable opportunity for us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please e-mail me or call 508-892-8928 if you have questions.  I will not be available to the phone on Friday, 4/21, but will be checking the e-mail for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;susan gale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.
