But the latest expedition to return from the trading posts came back empty-handed, with only eerie tales of barely-seen figures wandering out in the bitter cold. Is there a connection between these, the loss of contact with the Barbegazi, and the disappearance of many frontier folk on the border?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pre Reg*: $15/members and friends $25/non&lt;br /&gt;At Door: $25/members and friends $35/non&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Live Action Roleplaying Event (medieval fantasy in theme).  Durable and safe costuming is allowed.  If you have not attended an Adventure Night before and played a character, you will be given a pre-generated character to play.  Once you have played one event, you can opt to create your own character.  Arrive at least 30 minutes early (at 6pm) so that you may have time to look over the rule book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous swordsmanship experience is not required. We provide the padded weapons (and spell packets). This is a family event with adults, teens and kids (ages 6+). If not in costume, Sweats and T-shirts are suggested. No shorts or tanktops allowed. Under 18 must have signed waiver by parents. 18 and over must have their own signed waiver. Waivers can be downloaded here: &lt;a href="http://www.guardup.net/sword/documents/event_waiver.doc" target="_blank"&gt;Waiver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $15 for Meet Up members (and their friends) who pre-register ($25 for non). Pre-registration required as these events DO fill up and we cannot take anyone else after our capacity is reached. To pre-register you must call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead with a credit card or cash. Make sure to tell them that &amp;quot;Meghan sent you&amp;quot; so that you get the Meet Up rate which is the same as the Member Rate (a savings of $10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: RSVP with YES does NOT PRE-REGISTER. You MUST call (781) 270-4800 and pay ahead to complete the pre-registration process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At-Door is $25 and you may be turned away if there is not enough room. Since we fill up before the event more than 1/2 the time, pre-registration is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to be ontime for required safety instruction at start of event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the front desk... they can help you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meghan</member_name><member_id>5106555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233780680000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230610980000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adventure Night: Mystery at Crown of Ymir</name><id>9406061</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232839800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/9406061/</event_url></item>
