The Nashua&lt;br /&gt;River Rail Trail is a former railroad right of way that travels&lt;br /&gt;11 miles through the towns of Ayer, Groton, Pepperell and&lt;br /&gt;Dunstable. The trail offers a 10-foot wide paved surface for&lt;br /&gt;the entire length, and a five-foot wide gravel equestrian path&lt;br /&gt;for seven miles of the trail from Groton Center to the New&lt;br /&gt;Hampshire border in Dunstable. The entire trail is open to&lt;br /&gt;pedestrians, bicyclists, inline skaters, wheelchairs, and cross-&lt;br /&gt;country skiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is about a 2 hour ride, not a race but hopefully a work&lt;br /&gt;out. After we will hit a local place for a light dinner for all&lt;br /&gt;those that want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Take exit 5W to Rte 111A/main Dunstable Road. Take&lt;br /&gt;111A/MainDunstable south past the Dunkin Donuts, 7-11 and Shell&lt;br /&gt;gas station on your left. Continue straight. Go past the Conant&lt;br /&gt;Fire station for about 3.6 miles. You will see parking along&lt;br /&gt;the side of Route 111A. If you pass the Hollis Town line you&lt;br /&gt;have gone to far. Coming from Route 111, turn on to Route 111A&lt;br /&gt;under a mile you will see entrance to bike path, parking along&lt;br /&gt;Route 111A.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184882831000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
