Along the boulevard there is a bandstand for summer concerts, a couple of bathhouses and many pavilions where you can find shade and a place to sit and people watch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revere Beach is very accessible by from route one as well as public transportation in from the city.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the pavilion across from Kelly's and take in some shots of beach activity until dusk.  They we'll get into place for the fireworks show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may adjust the time depending on updated information as the event comes closer.  Please watch your email for updates during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the pavilion across from Kelly's</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>5274985</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250899049000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238099410000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revere Beach Fireworks</name><id>10043614</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250380800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/10043614/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/1/9/global_7847145.jpeg</photo_url></item>
