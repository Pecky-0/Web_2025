The show start at 10:00 PM. I suggest we meet at 9:00 PM. The goal is to meet each other and talk about our taste and experiences with music, diversity and life in general. This is a very informal and friendly meeting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So about tomorrow night if any of you is interested please R.S.V.P to let me know so we can meet in person there. We will meet outside at 9:00 PM or just ask for me at the stage if I am busy setting up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to list as many and diverse world music event as possible. My goal is to promote good music and get music lovers together to share our passion.  Please contact me with any info on a world music or a special event that you may know about.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jacques Pardo&lt;br /&gt;More info about Atlas Soul here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atlas-soul.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.atlas-soul...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for me at the stage or meet me at 9:00 PM in front outside</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacques Pardo / Atlas Soul</member_name><member_id>7850955</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244941918000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244660051000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Atlas Soul - Cross Cultural Music Experience</name><id>10622712</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244768400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/10622712/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/3/global_9087107.jpeg</photo_url></item>
