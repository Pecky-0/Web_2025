We're changing the day to saturday to accomodate some of our members' schedules this month and hosting in the afternoon, hoping the warmer part of the day won't be too cold for pups and people! Fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting in December I'll look into an indoor venue for winter meet-ups. Probably the new Good Dog Spot, where we met last year (but in a new - and supposedly bigger - location). Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, we hope you're able to make our next meetup: Saturday, Nov 7, at 2pm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thanks, so much, to all of you who donated some dollars to help cover the cost of meetups. This was the first month since the group's inception that your donations covered all meetup costs for the month! Thank you!! As always, donations are not manditory, but are very much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Til soon,&lt;br /&gt;Marianna&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263053071000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Pug Owners and Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernMApugs</urlname><id>1207399</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western MA Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254848053000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Western MA Pug November Meet-up!</name><id>11562760</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257620400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernMApugs/events/11562760/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/c/global_4651788.jpeg</photo_url></item>
