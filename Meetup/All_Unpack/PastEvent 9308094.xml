The latest news calls for the storm starting this afternoon and continuing throughout the night.  Just heard by 7:00 Sunday morning it may change over to sleet.  The sun is shining now so I'm going for my long run today and will not be running on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will leave the run posted and suggest changing your RSVP if you will not be attending.  Amy expressed interest in cross country skiing so she may be there if anyone would like to ski instead of run.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Cummings</member_name><member_id>4930656</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232288588000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenRunners</urlname><id>426798</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228840560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PIER 1 - SUNDAY RUN</name><id>9308094</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231681500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenRunners/events/9308094/</event_url></item>
