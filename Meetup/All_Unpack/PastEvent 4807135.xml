We will meet again from 1pm to 4pm at Especially for Pets in Sudbury.  IT IS OUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY!!!  We've been meeting every month since January 2005.  Please come and help us celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS AN EXCEPTION TO OUR USUAL PATTERN OF MEETING THE FIRST SUNDAY OF EACH MONTH.  Especially for Pets is closed on January 1st, the lst Sunday in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the downtown Boston Maltese Meet that has not taken place for the past couple of months: --- Suzanne Paxton, one of our members and the owner of Lola, has found a space in South Boston, hosted by the Polka Dog Bakery, which is very appropriate for our in-town meets and has lots of space.  Look for future announcements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maltese best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1136944681000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1133118377000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Maltese January Meetup - Our First Birthday!</name><id>4807135</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1136743200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/4807135/</event_url></item>
