NEEM is an opportunity for me to show off my neighborhood, Boston's North End. It is a place of beautiful parks and waterfront, great restaurants and late night cafes. We'll dine in, visit the summer feasts, the Taste of the North End event, wine tastings, a food tour and other special events. And for all of you night-owls like myself, there will be after-parties- at cafes, bars and even my place. So please join us for fun food events in Boston's "Little Italy." And a diverse membership is much desired.
