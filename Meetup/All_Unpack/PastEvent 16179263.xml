So Marissa and the group will be meeting at the Lansdowne around 6, then heading over to the HoB around 7 when the doors open.  She'll be in the mezzanine, so if you can't make it until after 7 and you happen to be there as well, call/text her when you arrive to find her and the group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call/text me when you arrive to find the group.
