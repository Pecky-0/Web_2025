Climb to the summit and you can see for miles around on a clear day. Once youâ€™ve gotten to the top of the former ski slopes (the smaller hill on the left is a much easier hike you come to walking trails from which you can see the Diamond Hill Reservoir to the east and Woonsocket and beyond to the west. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to bring water and a snack. Sturdy sneakers or hiking shoes suggested. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd prefer to skip the game (your loss &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;), your more then welcome to just do the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are welcome at the park, however signs say leashed.
