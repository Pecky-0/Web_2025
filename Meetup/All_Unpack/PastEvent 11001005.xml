This special Boston Bookcrossing Meetup will welcome mojosmom, an active bookcrosser from Chicago who will be visiting our fair city.  This is more of a social event, but book-swapping is welcomed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come hang out and chat with us over tea and crumpets! Tealuxe on Newbury Street has every kind of tea you can possibly imagine, as well as delicious sandwiches, and all for very reasonable prices.  There is a nice outdoor patio area, where we will try to get a table if the weather is good. (If it's raining, look for us in the downstairs cafe area).  I'll have the Ballycumber Bookcrossing sign.  Everyone is welcome!  (note that this meetup is scheduled for 6 p.m., an hour earlier than our normal evening meetup time)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the group with the Ballycumber Bookcrossing sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liz</member_name><member_id>220016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250035736000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249050702000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bookcrossing Meetup: Supplemental</name><id>11001005</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249596000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/11001005/</event_url></item>
