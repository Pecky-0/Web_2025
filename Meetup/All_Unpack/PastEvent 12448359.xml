Made from a nest-like mesh of salvaged and sewn sheet plastic, The Great Haul will take advantage of the Museum’s expansive entry space. A second exhibition of Hepler’s work, on view in the 4th floor gallery, will feature a series of cyanotype prints (or blue prints) made from digital photographs of small sculptures, and like her large installations, these works are defined by light. This will be Hepler’s first solo exhibition at the Portland Museum of Art.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be standing outside the entrance on Free St. between 6:45 and 7:05.
