This will allow us to meet in the Gallery, which is not available this week. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused! But hopefully this will give us all a good fresh start in the space where we will be meeting regularly.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brooke</member_name><member_id>8390120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265166629000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Artists and Creators!</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Artists-Way-Boston-area</urlname><id>1471304</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Artists Way Boston Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262308290000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Artists Way Cambridge Meetup</name><id>wjxfmyncblc</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264723200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Artists-Way-Boston-area/events/12187572/</event_url></item>
