<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The foliage is great this time of year and I've enjoyed the recent hikes that are on less used trails. I would like to return to the less popular side of The Blue Hills this coming Sunday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eastern side of the reservation offers some beautiful views while offering some fun terrain to traverse. This is not a walk in the woods. Please be prepared for 3-4 hours of steady hiking and the occasional run up or down some rocks. The trails are not very technical but do require some level of physical fitness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Plan&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the intersection of Route 28 and Chickatawbut Road. There is a small parking lot there. Please be early as the lot can get filled pretty quickly. If it gets full we can also park down the road a bit. We can hike for a few hours (3-4) and enjoy the views of Boston and the surrounding hills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Hike&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Eastern Red Dot Loop is about 4 miles. Depending on the pace we keep I can add to, or shorten, the distance. I would like to be out of the woods between noon and 1 pm. As always, I will adjust the hike for the needs of the group. If anyone has to leave early I can aways put you on a trail that sends you back to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan accordingly. I strongly recommend hiking shoes or boots. Sneakers really do not offer the rigidity or support need for hiking over rocky terrain. You will also want to bring enough water and snacks for you and your pet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me. I encourage everyone to enjoy the outdoors, but to also be prepared. Join us on a hike. You'll have a great time!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the tall guy with the green Chevy pickup and the pitbull</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257260979000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256654684000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eastern side of The Blue Hills</name><id>11722925</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257087600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/11722925/</event_url></item>
