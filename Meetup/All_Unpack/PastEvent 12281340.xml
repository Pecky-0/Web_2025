We'll have some local media coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* We plan on packing the house with over 200 people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Goal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're on a mission to raise at least $5,000 to benefit Charity: Water which is a non-profit organization bringing clean, safe drinking water to people in developing nations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a billion people don't have access to clean drinking water. That's one out of eight people that walk for miles to fill up old used gas cans with filthy polluted water. As a result, 4,500 children die from water related illnesses each and every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Solution:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charity: Water digs wells in developing nations. A well typically costs around $5,000 and provides clean drinking water for an entire community of around 250 people for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charity: Water raises their own funds to pay overhead so that 100% of all donations received ACTUALLY go to digging the well. In addition, they even provide updates for those that donated via video and Google Earth. We'll update the status of our well to you via FB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How You Can Help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A $25 donation will give one person clean safe drinking water for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, forward this invite to others...spread the good word!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check us out on Facebook.... www.bluechristmasevent.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Charity: Water...
