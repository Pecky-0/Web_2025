But before giving you the movie info just know that the current time given is just a guesstamate &amp;amp; will be updated later. Also, I will be wearing a meetup badge. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will grab a table by the windows at the top of the escalator. If the movie is showing downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand. I will be there 30 minutes prior to show time &amp;amp; we can go on in 10 min prior to show time. No worries if you run late ----after the movie I will wait outside the movie theatre &amp;amp; anyone that wishes to go for a bite to eat can join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movie: Starts at 7:05pm. I will be there by there by 6:30pm and we will be going into the theatre at 6:55pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synopsis From Movie Webpage &lt;br /&gt;

 “Ethan Wate, 17, has had the same recurring dream for months. A mysterious young girl is waiting for him on a Civil War battlefield. Ethan desperately wants to be with her, but there is an unknown danger—and each time a lightning bolt cracks like a gunshot, killing Ethan before he ever reaches the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger of this strange dream world, however, is preferable to Ethan's waking existence in Gatlin, South Carolina, a small, conservative Southern town that hasn't caught up to the 21st century, where nothing ever changes and nothing ever happens. Trapped at home with a father who has completely withdrawn since the sudden death of Ethan's mother, Ethan yearns for a life he can only read about in books.&lt;/p&gt;
