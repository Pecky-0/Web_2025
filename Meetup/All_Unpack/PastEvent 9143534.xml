Primary focus of the meeting will be endings.  You might want to consider the following questions:  What makes a good ending?  How does one choose the right place to end a story?  What is difficult about ending a piece of writing?  What are good strategies or suggestions you have for other writers about endings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)  Two writers have volunteered to bring writing for us to discuss.  Thomas has posted his story on our home page.  Ryan has volunteered to bring something to the meeting.  Others should feel free to bring writing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to some good discussion!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be there trying to save seats and reading</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1229473093000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226452292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>It's Not Over Till It's Over: 20-30 Something Creativer Writers Dec.
