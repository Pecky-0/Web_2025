An adaptation of Anton Chekovs' short story, &amp;quot;Ward No. 6&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ward No. 6 by Aleksandr Gornovsky and Karen Shakhnazarov (2009, 83 min.) Shot in an actual mental hospital, the director interviews real patients with actors only incidentally wandering in and out of the frame. The film focuses on Dr. Ragin, former head doctorâ€“turned asylum patient after forming a close relationship with a patient. Russia's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To read the Chekov short story in advance, you can access a free version at &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13409" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.gutenberg....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might also put a copy of the story in the files section. It's 42 pages long. Right now it's about 374K, but if I can convert it to pdf it'll be a fraction of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie we'll gather up near the screen on the right hand side (promptly!..the MFA usually moves us along), and then head out for our post movie discussion.  For that, we'll walk across the Fens to the Thai restaurant &amp;quot;Thaitation&amp;quot;, the former Brown Sugar for our post movie discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://thaitation.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://thaitation.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>4007722</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265046592000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263835547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Ward No. 6" at the MFA (Chekov adaptation)</name><id>12352840</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264873500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12352840/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/e/9/global_12688073.jpeg</photo_url></item>
