You've heard&lt;br /&gt;Bellevue's music in major motion pictures like&lt;br /&gt;Shallow Hal, as well as TV shows such as The Sopranos,&lt;br /&gt;Las Vegas, Ed, Sex and the City, Touched by an Angel,&lt;br /&gt;Brimstone, and Good and Evil. Bellevue Cadillac has&lt;br /&gt;been featured on Access Hollywood, CNN Showbiz,&lt;br /&gt;Hard Copy, and VH1 and has been recognized by&lt;br /&gt;Rolling Stone Magazine and People Magazine.&lt;br /&gt;To top if off, the band received 7 nominations&lt;br /&gt;from the National Academy of Recording Artists&lt;br /&gt;for the 2007 Grammy Awards for record of the year,&lt;br /&gt;album of the year, and song of the year. Don?t&lt;br /&gt;miss your chance to see this accomplished band&lt;br /&gt;live at the PCA in Westford!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This information was forwarded to me by one of our members.
