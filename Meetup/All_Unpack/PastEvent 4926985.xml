We chose 'Good Copy' from &amp;quot;The Early Ayn Rand,&amp;quot; which, though entertaining, proved not to be substantial enough for thought-provoking discourse.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For June, the group decided it might be good to mix in a little &amp;quot;deep thinking,&amp;quot; so we've decided to discuss 2 works:  'Think Twice' (also in &amp;quot;The Early Ayn Rand&amp;quot;) and Chapter 1, &amp;quot;Reality&amp;quot; in O.P.A.R.  (Objectivism:  The Philosophy of Ayn Rand).  Both books can be purchased easily either on line or in your local Barnes and Noble.  (I hesitate to promote Borders Books since they didn't display various magazines that featured the Danish cartoons.... a topic for another day, I suppose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry if you cannot find time to read both of the suggested readings.  The point of the group is to meet other folks interested in Ayn Rand's philosophy and grow in your understanding of it.  How much you read and can contribute depends on your schedule and interest.  Feel free to come with as little or as much knowledge of Ayn Rand as you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll hope to see you in June!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  May's attendees seemed to favor keeping Starbucks the meetup  location.  For many, it's nice to not have to pay for anything more than a cup of coffee, and in the nicer weather, it might be nice to go outside to the Common.  As our group grows, I'll see about reserving the entire room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pay meetup.com $19.00 per month to use their site, but for me, this is a small price to pay for the opportunity to meet other people interested in Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand.  However, if anyone would be willing to donate a dollar or two to help me defray the monthly expenditure, that would be great.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1147039343000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand June Meetup</name><id>4926985</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1149454800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/4926985/</event_url></item>
