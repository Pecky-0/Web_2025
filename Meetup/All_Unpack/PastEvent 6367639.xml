Jealous, busted my foot laborday and my list of 4,000 ftrs is NOT getting smaller. Bitter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But speaking of bitter, lets discuss bitters in BEER. Harpoonfest is happening and I'm going. =) This Saturday, I believe the doors open at 2pm and it ends at 9pm. For my own sanity I'm thinking closer to 4pm. =)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly...how do you find me? With no picture, loud environment etc? How about this - TEXT ME. 617-775-9406. I probably will not hear the phone, nor stop chatting with someone else to listen to my VM. TEXT ME when you get there, I should get that, and we'll coordinate a place to meet. =)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information on Harpoonfest how to get there , etc below!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, September 29th, 2:00 pm to 9:00 pm (Doors close at 7:30 pm)** &lt;br /&gt;How to Get to Octoberfest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Harpoon Brewery, 306 Northern Ave., on Boston's Waterfront &lt;br /&gt;Inside The Brewery amongst the tanks and outside under huge circus tents &lt;br /&gt;Free shuttles from the South Station area.
