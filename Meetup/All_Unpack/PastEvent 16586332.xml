&lt;p&gt;And now for something completely different! The object of this meeting is to construct or improve upon your: Trading Plan, Market Preparation Process, Post Trade Analysis Spreadsheet and Watchlist/scanning process. Ambitious, I know. If you have one or more of these written down in your computer, either email them to me, bring them on a flash drive or bring your laptop and you can plug it in to the projector. If you don't, bring your laptop and a flash drive anyway - we want to share and we want to go home with more than we came. Bring ideas on these subjects - yours, ideas from your dogeared and well highlighted trading texts, ideas from your favorite websites. Let's see how far we can get. If this is successful, we may do whole workshops on these topics - or we may make one or more of them into recurring segments of our meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or ideas that you would like to share before the meeting, please feel free email me at orrik@comcast.net .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
