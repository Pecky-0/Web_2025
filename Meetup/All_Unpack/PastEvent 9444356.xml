Ready to explore a new place in Boston?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us @ Brownstone (right near the Back Bay t-stop and next to Cleary's). Brownstone is accessible via T: orange line to Back Bay, green line to Copley or Prudential &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brownstone is a fun, relaxed, but nice bar/restaurant in between the Back Bay and South End areas. I'll be there a little before 7 and you should recognize me from my picture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be a good meetup to allow people to talk and introduce themselves. We've got some other great events in the works (including museum trips, movies, salsa lessons, and stand up comedy) so if this isn't your sort of thing, check back in a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you soon! Feel free to bring friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at a table with a "Meetup" sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232848049000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231115792000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Drinks at Brownstone </name><id>9444356</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231459200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/9444356/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/0/global_5172336.jpeg</photo_url></item>
