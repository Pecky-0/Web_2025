The leader (Bob Barnes) of the Wedeln Ski and Snowboard Race Team will hold dryland training every Monday night this Fall. The workout is great for anyone who wants to get in shape, you do not have to be a skier or racer. Bob's enthusiasm for skiing and training is contagious, he will get you working hard and getting results. All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat. Bob will lead the group in Plyometric based training methods designed to get the leg muscles ready for the season. This is the same workout that he has used for many years to prepare for ski racing. There is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape. Darlene Stokes will also lead the group in additional exercises designed to increase flexibility and build a strong core. Ski Fitness Training is a great way to get ready for the season and make some friends you can join on the slopes when the weather gets colder. The workouts last 1.5 hours and are always immediately followed by a few drinks and sometimes some food at a variety of Waltham center bars/restaurants. Please wear work-out clothes and athletic shoes with some ankle support.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet near the center of Waltham common - look for a small group in work out clothes.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319672826000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316214612000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ski Fitness Training</name><id>qqvddcypnbjc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319668200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak/events/34931862/</event_url></item>
