You can BYOB and for a $2.50 corkage fee per adult you can enjoy the wine of your choice. I've arranged for us to have the entire downstairs all to ouselves and the seating is such that we will actually be able to mingle a bit and have actual conversations. I'm thinking this will feel more like a party then a sit down dinner. The ambiance is er, umm WW-ll Army Quonset Hut - but refined. You'll just have to check it out for yourself to find out. Check out the menu here: &lt;a href="http://www.cafegrounded.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cafeground...&lt;/a&gt; You can order Tappa's or have a choice of either a $18 or a $25 Prix Fixe menu. I think this will fill quickly so sign up soon. As always, if you get lost, turned around or just feel you need a steer, call me at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;802&lt;br /&gt;233&lt;br /&gt;9060&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263690186000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261071370000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BYOB - to Cafe Grounded</name><id>12104083</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263081600000</time><rsvp_limit>19</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/12104083/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
