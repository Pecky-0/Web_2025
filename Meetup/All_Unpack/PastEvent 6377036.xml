Then &lt;br /&gt;break up into pairs and work the tailgaters &lt;br /&gt;with literature &amp;amp; DVD?s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 4?x8? signs and we would like to &lt;br /&gt;order more, which we can get 50 signs for &lt;br /&gt;$350 + shipping, (custom professional high &lt;br /&gt;quality) made with messages like:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1       &lt;br /&gt;Restore the Constitution  &lt;br /&gt;- Vote RonPaul2008.com&lt;br /&gt;2       &lt;br /&gt;End the War in Iraq&lt;br /&gt;3       &lt;br /&gt;Eliminate Income Tax&lt;br /&gt;4       &lt;br /&gt;NO Amnesty for Illegal Aliens &lt;br /&gt;5       &lt;br /&gt;More ideas welcome!!!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We will need to pay for these signs &lt;br /&gt;through our groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have a paypal account jukelsa3@yahoo.com &lt;br /&gt;and could start a pool for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Signs are $7.00 each and you will get the &lt;br /&gt;signs you pay for to take and hang wherever &lt;br /&gt;you like or keep around for sign waves. RI has &lt;br /&gt;been active in sign making and hanging with &lt;br /&gt;great results. Boston could use a sign hanging &lt;br /&gt;blitz event.&lt;br /&gt;We are heading into crunch time, the revolution is &lt;br /&gt;growing but we need all meetup members to get &lt;br /&gt;out to these events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make this or any other event, then &lt;br /&gt;the meetup requires a signed notarized affidavit &lt;br /&gt;stating your lame excuse why you won't be there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Contact: Bob Dwyer 508-930-5530 jukelas3@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;              Bob Larkin 508-813-6748 interleave1@earthlink.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542178000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190062171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gillette Stadium- Sunday October 7th.</name><id>6377036</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191762000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/6377036/</event_url></item>
