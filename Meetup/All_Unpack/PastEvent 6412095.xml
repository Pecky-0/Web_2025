Afterwards, several of us are heading over to the Myopia Hunt Club in Hamilton (a few towns over from Ipswich) to see a Polo Match.  The match starts at 3:00pm.  It is $10 per car to enter the field.  Those of us who are having lunch at the Clam Box will likely car pool over together in one or two cars.  But, even if you can't join us for lunch....  Please feel free to meet up with us at the Polo Match.  &lt;br /&gt;Here are a few links for more information and directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zvents.com/south-hamilton-ma/events/show/13923436-polo-at-myopia" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.zvents.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules of Polo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://detroitpoloclub.com/rules_of_polo.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://detroitpoloclu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're bringing cheese, crackers, etc, and you can bring wine and whatever other munchies you want.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;Karen&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beantown and Beyond</member_name><member_id>4494456</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190746935000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190550432000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Impromptu Tailgating at a Polo Match 3:00pm today (9/23)</name><id>6412095</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190574000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/6412095/</event_url></item>
