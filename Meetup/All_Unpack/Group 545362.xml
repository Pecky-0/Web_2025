Come and meet local ex-Midwesterners and relive great memories about the wholesome charm of middle America. This group is open to anyone who is from/or has lived in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

My other home states included Colorado, Alabama and Washington DC. You are welcome as well.

Also expatriates are welcome since I lived outside the U.S. several times. 

Also - I just started a group for Westerners .... please tell your friends and colleagues.

Bottom line - this group is for friendly people who want to meet other friendly people. It's primary purpose in social, having fun, and meeting other like-minded folks.

If you end up getting a business lead, job, date, whatever, that's fine. Just appreciate this is relaxed and easy going group. 

If you're from Boston but attended university in the Midwest, you are more than welcome!

My motto is:  Conversations first, business cards later!

Look forward to seeing you soon!
