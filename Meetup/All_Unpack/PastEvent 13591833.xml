Please bring one or two of your favorite poems to read and share with us what draws you to them. Or simply come to listen. If you choose to bring a poem, include the name of the poet and the title of the poem on your RSVP, so we all have a chance to familiarize ourselves with it  before the reading. And be mindful of length. T.S. Eliot's &amp;quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&amp;quot; is about the lengthiest we can accommodate.  And yes, someone already told me they will bring that one to the reading. You can also expect to hear Rimbaud's &amp;quot;Vowels&amp;quot; and ee cummings' &amp;quot;in Just&amp;quot;.  Now, what will you bring?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If weather permits, we will have the meeting outdoors, possibly in the Harvard Yard. However, let's meet at the usual spot and head there together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277073622000</updated><rating><average>4.17000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274811922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Evening of Poetry Reading</name><id>13591833</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275861600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/13591833/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
