Have you ever thought &amp;quot;Hey - it would be cool to walk the entire thing and see where it goes&amp;quot;?  Well, come join some nerds and let Boston By Foot take you there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of the Boston Marathon on Patriots Day, our 2.62 mile course will begin with an easy downhill and an introduction to the stars of the show (many of whom will be resting out this year's marathon in the comfort of the Granary Burying Ground).  We'll see the sites where they went to school, where they protested, and where they drank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing the Greenway will bring you to the second portion of the course, through a labyrinth of small neighborhood streets, where you'll hear the story of a man who hung a couple of lanterns and another who rode a horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing the Charles marks the the final leg of the course, and you'll see where Boston began. It includes the climb of a hill, where your heart may break upon hearing the story of General Warren's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish line is adorned with flags (and some cannons), and you will be able to tell your friends you completed the course in about 3 hours.  By the end, you'll also know why we celebrate Patriots Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get patriotic, lace up your running shoes, and come out for the Footloose on the Freedom Trail walking tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logistics:&lt;/b&gt; The Massachusetts State House is that big building with the gold dome overlooking the Boston Common.  Get off the T at Park Street and walk up the hill.  We'll be meeting on the steps.  The tour starts promptly at 10:00am, so please show up a little early and look for Amy (I'll be wearing a blue Boston By Foot baseball cap sporting a Meetup logo button and holding a blue flag with a white foot on it and collecting $$$ for the tour - buy your tickets from me in person).  Our pace won't be that brutal, but please make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and to bring a bottle of water.  The tour is $20 per person/$5 for &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot card holders (see web site for membership details - quite a deal, as we Nerds will be doing other tours with BBF throughout the year)&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271792543000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271102897000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston By Foot Tour - Footloose on the Freedom Trail</name><id>13161788</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271598300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/13161788/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/6/global_4659430.jpeg</photo_url></item>
