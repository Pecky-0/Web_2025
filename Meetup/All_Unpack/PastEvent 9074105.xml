If you would like to go and feel qualified, please email me and I will see if I can add you. You will hear back from me one way or the other** I want to start off the new year right by finishing off my New Hampshire 4000 footers! The details of this trip are up in the air as I figure out how to deal with the fish hatchery gate, but I plan to do a loop from the east, going over Cabot, The Bulge, and The Horn. The trip will be about 11 miles if the gate is a non-issue. Otherwise the trip will be 15 miles if we park below the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This far north, expect it to be fully winter! Snowshoes required and additional traction recommended (microspikes or crampons). Contact me if you have any questions. More info to follow in December!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew B</member_name><member_id>4803051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231160677000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225579625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Cabot - Finally #48</name><id>9074105</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230987600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9074105/</event_url></item>
