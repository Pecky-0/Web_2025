The Waterfire viewing will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hour.  Afterward, folks can head to the live Jazz stage or the outdoor salsa event a few blocks away.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner&lt;/b&gt; - we will be meeting for dinner on Federal Hill area in Providence. Please be there on time at 5 pm. We will meet at Constantino's @ 265 Atwells Ave, Providence. This is right next to Depasquale Square where we will have dinner. There is some parking on Atwells Ave and the side streets as well as Spruce St. which is parallel to Atwells Ave. After dinner we will walk to Providence Mall to meetup with the others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are not joining us for dinner, we will meet you at 7 pm outside of the Mall at the Cityside entrance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who plan to park at &lt;b&gt;Providence Place&lt;/b&gt; - parking cost about $10 for 5-8 hours and does not have to be validated. However, you do have to prepay your parking stub before you get to your car and exit the lot. There are parking vending machines to pay your stub in the mall. And be warned that exiting can take a long time - sometimes an hour or more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More event detail can be found at the following link:  &lt;a href="http://www.waterfire.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.waterfire....&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transportation is your own responsibility, however if you need or want to carpool please contact the event organizers. We will do our best to help facilitate carpools as needed. Our members are good about offering carpools. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note carpoolers may want to share the cost of gas and parking with the driver.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the Cityside Exit at the Providence Place Mall (Next to Uno)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve </member_name><member_id>5132502</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tony / Pei</member_name><member_id>8262284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281916327000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280805504000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterfire 2010 w/ Live Jazz and Salsa Dancing</name><id>14300170</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281826800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/14300170/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/d/global_10145821.jpeg</photo_url></item>
