We can reschedule ASAP - by mid-afternoon at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191107173000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190913922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul Lottery</name><id>6439054</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190934000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/6439054/</event_url></item>
