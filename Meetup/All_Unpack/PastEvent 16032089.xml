If you bring CASH and give it to me when we arrive, we can get $2.00 off the price of admission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snowshoe Rentals are available for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Includes Admission to Trails&lt;br /&gt;Adults: $12.00&lt;br /&gt;Children 12 &amp;amp; Under: $8.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Member Snowshoe Rentals&lt;br /&gt;Adults: $4.00 &lt;br /&gt;Children 12 &amp;amp; Under: $3.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daytime snowshoeing is first come first serve.&lt;br /&gt;We do not accept reservations for daytime snowshoeing.

Reservations are required&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we finish Snowshoeing lets all go someplace and grab a bite to eat!  I shall think up somewhere good to go!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is America's Stonehenge? &lt;br /&gt;Built by a Native American Culture or a migrant European population? No one knows for sure. A maze of man-made chambers, walls and ceremonial meeting places, America's Stonehenge is most likely the oldest man-made construction in the United States (over 4000 years old). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Stonehenge in England, America's Stonehenge was built by ancient people well versed in astronomy and stone construction. It has been determined that the site is an accurate astronomical calendar. It was, and still can be, used to determine specific solar and lunar   events of the year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Various inscriptions have been found throughout the site including Ogham, Phoenician and Iberian Punic Script. Dr. Barry Fell of Harvard University did extensive work on the inscriptions found at the site. They are detailed in his book America B.C.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate Drive Times:&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA                          35 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Concord, NH                         35 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Portsmouth, NH                    40 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Worcester, MA                      55 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Providence, RI                       90 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;White Mountains, NH             95 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Rye/Hampton Beach, NH        45 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Maine (Kittery)                       55 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Maine (Portland)                     90 Minutes &lt;br /&gt;Salem, MA                             55 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Lakes Region (Meredith), NH   75 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;Vermont (Woodstock)            135 Minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Cyndi from the Greater Boston Cycling Meetup group.]</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cyndi</member_name><member_id>3604417</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297550070000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294893954000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lets Go Snowshoeing &amp; Explore America's Stonehenge at Mystery Hill</name><id>16032089</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295805600000</time><rsvp_limit>32</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/16032089/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/2/8/global_20768344.jpeg</photo_url></item>
