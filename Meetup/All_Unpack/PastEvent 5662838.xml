Over 50 community organizations have joined together to reach all 123,000 of New Haven's citizens through an eight-week series of events and activities devoted to Mockingbird such as panel discussions, essay contests, reading circles, classroom projects, film screenings, theatrical readings and unique events aimed at non-reader audiences, but with a special focus on those 35 years and under. The program will conclude with a series of features &lt;br /&gt;performances, panels and special events on the New Haven Green during our June 2007 Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceeds from the Black &amp;amp; White Ball will be used to purchase books and materials for the Big Read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Informal black and white attire suggested. Bring a new or gently used copy of &amp;quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&amp;quot; and receive a free drink voucher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $15 in advance or $25 at the door.
