<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi y'all! My partner Carly and I just moved to town, and we have a new apartment that needs to be broken in! We had a great time meeting some of you New Haven Vegans at Vegan Drinks earlier this month, and now we'd love to invite you over to our place for board games and vegan baked goods after work on Wednesday, 3/20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a huge mix of board games, including but not limited to Scrabble, Bananagrams, Scattergories, RoboRally, Dixit, Ticket to Ride, and Fluxx, and you can of course bring your own games to share. We'll also provide some snacks and drinks, but your contributions are also welcomed and encouraged. Feel free to bring friends and family members to play along, though no animal friends, please -- my two cats would be very unhappy with other critters in their space.  They barely tolerate us as it is.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll email our address a day or two in advance to folks who have confirmed their attendance, but to give you a general idea, we're on the border between New Haven and Hamden, at the north end of East Rock Park. We're accessible by M bus line and are about 3mi from downtown New Haven.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363877493000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-386</urlname><id>279146</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362682910000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Board Games and Baked Goods</name><id>108125442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363820400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-386/events/108125442/</event_url></item>
