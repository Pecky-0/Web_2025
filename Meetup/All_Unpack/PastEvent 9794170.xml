<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will hike a thru-hike of about 7.7 miles in the southwestern corner of MA. This hike is moderate to hard and not for beginners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will take us gradually down through Sages Ravine (start alt 1832 ft. then down to about 1400 ft.) with an interesting stream that will have several little waterfalls and pools that should have a fair amount of ice formations this time of year. Then we will ascend to clifftop trail and on to Mt. Race (alt 2365 ft.), down to 1900 ft., and then a steep ascent to Mt. Everett (alt. 2602 ft.). If the weather is clear, we should have a good view of the area. Then we descend a bit to a dirt road that takes us to Guilder Pond (alt 2042 ft.) and the picnic areas (and Port-A-Potty) and further on to the cars at the endpoint (about 1700 ft.). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of this hike follows the AT northbound and can be rather scenic if weather cooperates. There is a chance for a fair amount of ice given the rain predicted the day before and the freeze overnight (28 F). Some experience and equipment for cold weather hiking as well as icy conditions is required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go MUST have:  &lt;br /&gt;* A daypack - To carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail food and water.  &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed warm hiking boots or comfortable winter boots (no sneakers!) - There will likely be ice/snow or it could be wet/muddy!  &lt;br /&gt;* MICROspikes (or crampons) -MUST have! There WILL be ice! &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks - To keep those feet warm even if wet.  &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing - Avoid cotton as it stays wet/cold. Don't forget your legs can get cold too.  &lt;br /&gt;* Gloves - MUST have and warm ones too!  &lt;br /&gt;* Jacket - Warm outer layer. &lt;br /&gt;* Hat - You loose 20% of your heat through your head! Protect those ears too.  &lt;br /&gt;* 2 quarts of water - MUST bring!  &lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate food/lunch - (e.g. at least G.O.R.P -Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, beef jerky, granola bars, etc.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advised equipment depending on conditions: &lt;br /&gt;* Gators - Suggested, as there could still be snow on the trail.  &lt;br /&gt;* Hiking poles - For better stability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jacket shouldn't be too heavy as other layers of clothing should add to your insulation to keep warm and layers would be added or removed as needed. While hiking you WILL be hot but if you stop you WILL get very cold after about 15 minutes and thus need more dry layers added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 9 AM at the parking area at the hike endpoint (see location/directions below). We will condense into one or more vehicles and drive to the start location (see location/directions below) and start hiking at about 9:15 AM. We will hike (with rest stops and sightseeing) about 6 hr. but it could be up to 8 hrs. depending on conditions and get back to the vehicles at about anywhere from 3 PM to 5 PM. Then the plan is to head out to eat in Lee, MA at a location to be determined or you can just head home on your own.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S can provide carpooling for up to 6 from the Wal-Mart in E. Windsor ***leaving*** at a 7 AM for those interested. The drive is about 1.75 hour to the meetup location. Return at about 8 PM at the latest (6 PM at earliest). You must call or e-mail Kevin (number in RSVP) so he knows you plan to carpool. If no one signs up for the carpool, the carpool will be canceled and not go to the Wal-Mart location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/print/mt-washington.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt.
