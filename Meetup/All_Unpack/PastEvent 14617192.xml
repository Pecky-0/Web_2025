Typically this meetup has been a chance for beginners--and I mean beginners!--to practice what they have learned thus far, whether it is fingerspelling, vocab, or juts learning the alphabet.  We might have a fingerspelling game for the advanced beginners if there is a large enough group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are just starting out, or if you started a while back but are way out of practice, you are welcome at this meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a NOTE for advanced signers:  you are welcome to come too, but please be willing to help out with the beginners, as opposed to forming a separate group of yourselves.  There are plenty of meetups for you guys.  This one is for the NEWBIES!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at Diesel, mainly because of the A/C issues Starbucks has been having.  See you next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284431358000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>ASL Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonasl</urlname><id>1298565</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston ASL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283348114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BEGINNER LEVEL ASL Meetup</name><id>14617192</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283990400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonasl/events/14617192/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/1/global_16399809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
