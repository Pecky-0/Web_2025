Rhythm &amp;amp; Blues, arguably America's finest and most well known export, is the music The Bernadettes specialize in performing. The very familiar toe-tapping sounds of Motown, the infectious dance grooves of Memphis soul shouters such as Wilson Pickett, the smooth, sophisticated Philly soul music of Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire, the hard driving funk-rock of Sly and the Family Stone, the soothing grooves of R&amp;amp;B crooners like Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers, and, of course, the unforgettable music of the king of soul, Mr. James Brown - this is the music The Bernadettes perform. Yes, they'll mix it up with a few modern contemporary dance hits here and there, a classic rock number, or an oldies favorite, but the emphasis is on the classic &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; R&amp;amp;B music that American baby boomers have grown up with and folks of all ages have enjoyed dancing to for several decades. Check them out at their web site. &lt;a href="http://jameskader.hom.." target="_blank"&gt;http://jameskader.hom...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Margaret</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245456371000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
