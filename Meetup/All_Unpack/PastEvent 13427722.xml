Instead of fighting all the tourists and traffic, let's enjoy something close to home this weekend with your fellow Not-Too-Intense-Hikers - and what can be better than a great hike, bird watch, and picnic in the wilderness areas surrounding the Ipswich River! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massaudubo...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at or near the entrance / parking lot area.  The directions are on the web site; please send me an e-mail if you need more information.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure and pack along a big picnic lunch, coffee, and water!  I'm estimating the hike and picnic will last approximately 3 hours, depending on how often we stop to watch for birds.  Hike will be at a leisurely pace.  Bring along a can of bug spray.  Please note that the sanctuary does charge a $4 entrance fee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you then (if not earlier in the month up here in Maine!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be waiting in the parking lot at or near the entrance.
