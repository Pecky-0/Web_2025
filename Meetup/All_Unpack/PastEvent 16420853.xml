Learn and ask questions about what others in the area are doing- it's also nice to know a friendly face when trying something new :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you belong to a local group or go to a regular event that you think others might be interested in, here's your chance to let people know in an informal setting. It's as easy as standing up, saying your and your group name, what it's about, and where people can look for more information. You also might meet some cool people with similar interests in the process. Please message me (Robyn) if you're willing to stand up and talk for a minute so I can put you on the schedule as well as put your group/event in a list for people. Please note: no sales, just fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come out and meet other Boston area Science Fiction and Fantasy fans in a comfortable setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the regular social meetup for the Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group, which always happens on the First Tuesday of every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regularly meet at Tavern in the Square in Central Square (NOTE: NOT THE ONE IN PORTER SQUARE). We have a standing reservation for the private room in the back, so we have a reasonably quiet space to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're taking the T, Central Square is on the Red Line, and Tavern in the Square is about a block away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're driving in, there are a few parking lots nearby. There are two metered public lots at the intersection of Bishop Allen Drive and Prospect St:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/5fLIL8" target="_blank"&gt;http://bit.ly/5fLIL8...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also pay parking ($8 for the evening) here:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pilgrimparking.com/facilities/central_sq/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pilgrimpar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll probably talk about the books, television, movies, comics and games that we like (and those we don't like, and even those we may be ashamed to admit that we like), but there is no set agenda!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're can't come on time, that's fine, there is usually still a critical mass of people until 8:00 PM (or later). If you want to come early, that is fine too, I try to get there around 6 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have SciFi/Fantasy Books or DVDs that you don't want anymore? Feel free to bring them to the meetup and give them away (please, no sales here), but be sure that you take home anything that is left.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn</member_name><member_id>9373103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297271375000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296696156000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February Social Meetup- On again one week later (still with talks)</name><id>16420853</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297207800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/16420853/</event_url></item>
