Under attack are our sense of belonging to a unique and&lt;br /&gt;durable community, the health of the natural environment, and the jobs that provide decent&lt;br /&gt;livelihoods. OURTOWN follows the story of two young mothers-turned-activists who challenged the&lt;br /&gt;largest corporate retailer in the world, and won. This is a film about empowerment and hands-on&lt;br /&gt;democracy; ultimately, it asks the questions: Who is in charge? Who gets to choose? What kind of&lt;br /&gt;town do you want to live in?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailer:  &lt;a href="http://www.ourtownmaine.com/trailer.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ourtownmai...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film makers from Red Door Media will be joining us for a discussion period after the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:30 Potluck - an integral part of our meetings!&lt;br /&gt;7:00 or so - introductions and start the film (55 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Discussion with Wrap up between 8:30 and 8:45&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see our Meetup Event RSVP Guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://permaculture.meetup.com/58/messages/boards/thread/5233158#20208623"&gt;http://permaculture.m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring your own potluck kit (plate/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin)!
