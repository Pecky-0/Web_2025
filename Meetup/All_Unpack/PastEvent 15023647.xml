Why is that?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How often do you frustratedly think to yourself, &amp;quot;What am I doing wrong?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Where's my money?!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight we'll mastermind together, and Mark and I will also share some of the key strategies that we have learned for attracting financial abundance and some common reasons that can keep you in a financial rut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to open up some new possibilities in this area of your life?  Well, as they say in the gameshow, &amp;quot;The Price is Right&amp;quot;...Come on down!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Thank you so much to those of you who have RSVP'd &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &lt;u&gt;and showed up&lt;/u&gt;! PLEASE, PLEASE, only sign up if you really &lt;i&gt;intend to show up&lt;/i&gt;.  We set up our space, and prepare snacks and handouts accordingly.  Also, we can only take a maximum of 20 people in our space, and do not want to exclude anyone unnecessarily because of a no-show. Help us reach our goal of 100% attendance for those who rsvp &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun!

Hope to hear from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eagerly looking forward to co-creating with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're down a very long driveway, with white mailbox at street end.
