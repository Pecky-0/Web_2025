Recovery has been slow, but he's making great progress.  Steve has been a fixture on the local music scene as the leader of Wilbur and the Dukes and has performed dozens of benefit concerts with them for a number of worthy causes.&lt;br /&gt;Now it's time to give back to a guy who never says no to someone in need.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A benefit for Steve will be held rain or shine on Sunday September 14th from 1-7pm at Ralph's Diner on Prescott St. in Worcester &lt;b&gt;Some of the biggest names on the local R&amp;amp;B scene will be there including: James Montgomery, Clutch Crabwell, Shakey Steve &amp;amp; The Blue Cats, Jason James &amp;amp; the Baystate HouseRockers, and of course.... Wilbur &amp;amp; The Dukes!!!!!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viva Bene is providing the buffet, there'll be a 50/50 raffle, silent and live auctions, and a whole lot more.  Tickets are just $25.00 and are available at the door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on down, enjoy the show, and more importantly help a guy who always helps others.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>TBD:  please check back  for updates</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221926100000</updated><rating><average>1.20000004768</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>37</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219427178000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>R &amp; B @ RALPH'S DINER ( Worcester) -  A  WSRS Benefit Event</name><id>8599546</id><headcount>36</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221411600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/8599546/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/1/6/global_4283654.jpeg</photo_url></item>
