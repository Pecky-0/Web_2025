Come one, come all and Knit In Public!  Since we have decided not to worry about permission or anything like that, should you arrive and not find us there, we may have been asked to leave.  In that event, we will relocate to White's Park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email privately if you would like my cell number in case you have trouble finding us.  I don't want to post it on a board the public has access to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Probably by the yarn and needles</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>1774915</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245074971000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Knitters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>knitting-486</urlname><id>179362</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Concord Knitting Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244084116000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>World Wide Knit in Public Day!!!</name><id>10572222</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244901600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/knitting-486/events/10572222/</event_url></item>
