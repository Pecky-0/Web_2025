It?s being held at the Ecotarium November 9 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Greater Worcester Land Trust, and it?s featuring a photo presentation and exhibit by a wonderful (and local) underwater photographer named Brian Skerry, who shoots for National Geographic as well as other adverture magazines. His stuff is fabulous ? and it?s inspirational to see a local boy making good. I hope some of you can come and meet him and hear him speak. The cost is $20. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swimming with Sharks&lt;br /&gt;Specializing in underwater photography and ocean wildlife, Brian is commissioned regularly by editorial and commercial clients worldwide. Best known for his style that combines expressive imagery and elusive animal behavior, Brian?s pictures and stories reveal worlds and creatures rarely seen. check out his work at www.brianskerry.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EcoTarium Friday Nov 9 6:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;Hors d'oeuvres/ cash bar&lt;br /&gt;Photo Presentation 7:30 in the Alden Planetarium&lt;br /&gt;Admission 20.00 adults 5.00 kids&lt;br /&gt;Reservations 508-795-3838 or www.gwlt.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not an event to be missed!!!
