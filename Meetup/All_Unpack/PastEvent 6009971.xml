Between schools vacations, playing hooky from work, and just enjoying the [brief New England] nice weather who's got this time? Well, er, we do...but we're holding off on the formal presentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your &amp;quot;thinking cap&amp;quot;, a tough OSS/PHP problem, and an appetite for participation, we're throwing a Beach Blanket Summer School Party (beach blanket optional). We will have all the fixin's to throw code on the table, dissect and discuss the ins-and-outs of PHP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bring a topic/problem, bring a friend, bring Anette Funicello (remember, you can't play beach ball without a-net), bring your wallet (we're meeting at the Cambridge Brewing Company).&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186180593000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184197278000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston PHP Meetup August Meetup</name><id>6009971</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186007400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/6009971/</event_url></item>
