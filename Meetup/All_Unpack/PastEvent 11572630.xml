This is to benefit the Braintree Athletic Association.  Here is way to give back for use of the facilities we use a group year round. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND!  After getting up nice and early, getting in our run or walk, we won't be a need to feel guilty for reaching for 2nds later!  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5k is approximately 3.1 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check-in at the Registration Table at Braintree High School in the Cafeteria after 7am.
