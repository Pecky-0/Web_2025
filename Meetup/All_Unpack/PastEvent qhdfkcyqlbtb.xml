It is my intent to go through how I personally develop an options trading plan and position, ending up with a template everyone can use as the basis for constructing their own options plays. The material considered will still be basic in nature, and will build upon the concepts discussed at the July meeting, but we will go a little deeper into what's actually going on. Those of you who decide to add options to your trading toolboxes will find they have a great deal to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a book they'd care to recommend, or provide a review on for the group, please let me know via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, bringing questions regarding a favorite stock from your own watchlists (or perhaps even a trade from the past) for a group critique is very much encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room). Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a lively and engaging discussion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile...&lt;/p&gt;
