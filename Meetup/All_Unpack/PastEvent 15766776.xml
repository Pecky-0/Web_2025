This meeting on January 27 at 7 pm is for The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot and will be downstairs at Life Alive.  This is a non-fiction account of the how unique cancer cells taken unknowingly from the titular poor African-American woman shortly before her death in the 1950's have been integral to many scientific advances since that time.  The author also explores Henrietta's life and contacts her family as they learn of her contribution to science decades after her cells were first cultured.
