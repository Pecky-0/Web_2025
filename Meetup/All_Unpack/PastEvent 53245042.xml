&lt;p&gt;from their site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"PAX East is a three-day game festival for tabletop, videogame, and PC gamers. We call it a festival because in addition to dedicated tournaments and freeplay areas we've got nerdcore concerts, panel discussions, and an exhibitor hall filled with booths displaying the latest from top game publishers and developers. Even with all this amazing content the best part of PAX East is hanging out with other people who know their shit when it comes to games."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not a hardcore gamer, it's bound to be a lot of fun. Three-day passes are all sold out, but one-day passes are still available for all three days. Saturday has sold out as well - hopefully you have your pass!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there's almost 40 of us, let's meet up and get lunch - we'll meet at the PAX Food Court.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>PAX Food Court</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>9704391</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ben S.</member_name><member_id>12781630</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333824687000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>38</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329865470000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PAX East 2012</name><id>53245042</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333819800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/53245042/</event_url></item>
