&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of the Cold War, Haywood must obtain justice in a case with raised stakes and mixed emotions. Maximilian Schell co-stars in an Oscar-lauded performance as defense counsel for the Nazi prisoners. Co-starring Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, and Marlene Dietrich.&lt;/p&gt;
