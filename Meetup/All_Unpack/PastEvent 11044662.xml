It will be very crowded all 3 evenings. But Sunday may not be quite as crowded as the other 2 nights. Let's get together at Joe Tecce's (61 North Washington St., www.joetecces.com) from 6:00-7:00, have a drink and get (re-)acquainted before we head over to the feast. The restaurant is diagonally across the street from NEBO. From North Station, you would  walk down Causeway St. toward the North End, but before you get to the large intersection at the bridge, go right on N. Washington. It's a 5-minute walk from North Station and a 3-minute walk from Haymarket Station. Please check in with me at the bar when you get there. We'll enter the feast at the corner of Causeway and Endicott Streets at about 7:00. For those who haven't been before, North End Summer feasts feature Italian food (calamari, arancini, pizza, etc.), souvenir vendors, food samples, live music, games, religious symbols and great people watching. We'll start out together but you can branch off to pursue your interests at any time. We'll talk about an after-party when we meet-up at Tecce's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further guidelines. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim S.</member_name><member_id>4216983</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1253382714000</updated><rating><average>3.79999995232</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM</urlname><id>1397251</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>North End Eating Meetup (NEEM)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249507491000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Feast of St. Anthony</name><id>11044662</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251673200000</time><rsvp_limit>23</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-End-Eating-Meetup-NEEM/events/11044662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/7/a/global_7834474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
