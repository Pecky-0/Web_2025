I'm the new organizer and I can't wait to meet everyone! I apologize if this meetup seems last minute, but I really wanted to have an event before Thanksgiving. If you can't make this one, I'm planning to have another event in December so I hope to see you then! Trivia starts at 7, but its my experience with pub trivia nights that we should arrive around 6:30 to grab tables. I'll have a sign so you can easily identify the group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bonnie</member_name><member_id>12912717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321622672000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Southerners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>exsoutherners-38</urlname><id>679749</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Ex-Southerners Meetup Group - Boston Region</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321061373000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ The Kinsale in Government Center</name><id>40862462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321486200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/exsoutherners-38/events/40862462/</event_url></item>
