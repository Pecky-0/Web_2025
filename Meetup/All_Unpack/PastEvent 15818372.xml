The bare ledges that comprise the upper half of the mountain coupled with the geography of the surrounding area also make this mountain a very interesting tune-up for winter activities.  Winds on the bare ledges are typical of what is experienced further north, and the temperatures experienced on the mountain are frequently much colder than the surrounding area.  If you've never summited this mountain in the winter, this is an ideal way to start the new year and prepare for more northern hikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in the main parking lot at Mount Monadnock State Park at 9:30 AM.  &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is a $4.00 Entrance Fee to Mount Monadnock State Park.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The park entrance is located on Poole Road in Jaffrey, NH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note that dogs are not permitted on this hike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What:&lt;/i&gt;  Mount Monadnock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Distance:&lt;/i&gt; about 4 miles round trip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/i&gt; about 1900'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difficulty:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pace:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exposure:&lt;/i&gt; Some exposure and open ledges on this route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Special Conditions:&lt;/i&gt; Reports indicate significant ice on all trails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book Time:&lt;/i&gt; 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is This Hike for Me?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike will be at a&lt;b&gt;moderate pace&lt;/b&gt;. We make every attempt to keep the group together throughout the hike.  This is especially true when hiking in winter.  We will gain about 1900' during the hike.  Expect several steep sections both up and down under very icy conditions.  The views are spectacular.  &lt;b&gt;Current trail reports describe thick sheets of ice with very little snow.  Microspikes, Hillsounds, or Crampons are mandatory.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To participate you should:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable hiking UPHILL at about 1.5 to 2.0 miles per hour at a 15% incline for about 3 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable walking &lt;b&gt;at least 5 miles&lt;/b&gt; on uneven terrain including ice, snow, roots, rocks, and granite ledges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have sturdy hiking boots suitable for cold weather.  &lt;b&gt;No Sneakers&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have rain and wind protection.  &lt;b&gt;No Ponchos&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be able to carry at least 2 liters of water. (Remember, 1 liter weighs 2 pounds!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be in good physical condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have appropriate traction devices (Microspikes, Hillsounds, or Crampons.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather and Trail Conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Microspikes&lt;/b&gt; -  Trails throughout New Hampshire are currently covered with a thick sheet of ice.  There is very little snow covering that ice, so the trails have been extremely slippery.   Please plan on bringing at least Microspikes or Hillsounds.  I will update this section later this week if conditions require any more than that (i.e. Snowshoes.)  If you have full crampons, they should become a standard part of your winter pack.  If you don't have crampons, be sure you at least have Microspikes or Hillsounds. &lt;b&gt; No Stabilicers or Yak Trax, please!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Boots&lt;/b&gt; - Also, please note that this is the time of year where you need to transition out of your summer hiking boots and into a pair of winter hiking boots.  You do NOT need plastic boots for general hiking anywhere in NH, but you WILL need waterproof winter boots &lt;i&gt;comfort rated&lt;/i&gt; to at least -30 degrees.  (No, we don't typically encounter those temperatures, but boots with that rating will keep you warm while you're having your lunch on snow or ice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Water&lt;/b&gt; - Finally, you see the note below that your water must be in wide-mouth plastic bottles.  It is time to put your hydration systems - e.g. Camelbak's - away for the winter.  While they do sell insulated tubes for the hydration systems, quite frankly they do not work.  The entrance to the tube where it connects to the bladder still freezes, leaving you with a bladder full of inaccessible water.  Therefore, unless it is unseasonably warm for this hike, you'll need to carry water the old fashioned way.  Be sure to get wide mouth bottles and be sure to carry them upside down.  (Water freezes from the top down.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mandatory Equipment List as of 25 December 2010.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This list could change based on trail conditions just prior to the hike.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microspikes, Hillsounds, or Crampons. &lt;b&gt;No Yak Trax or Stabilicers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synthetic shirt and pants. &lt;b&gt;No cotton.  No jeans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sturdy Hiking Boots suitable for cold weather.  &lt;b&gt;No Sneakers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rain / Wind Jacket. &lt;b&gt;No Ponchos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm fleece layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm gloves or preferably mittens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm fleece or wool hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 liters Water in wide-mouth bottles.  &lt;b&gt;No hydration systems!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balaclava&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headlamp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trail Snacks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optional Gear:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hand / Toe warmers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiking Poles - strongly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goggles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gaiters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen / Sunglasses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camera / Binoculars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Jeans, Sneakers, or Cotton clothing on the hike! It's winter; this will be strictly enforced.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carpool Option&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are interested, we will meet in the parking lot at Lincoln Mall on Rte 116 in RI next to the McDonald's at 7:00 AM.  We will leave Lincoln Mall PROMPTLY at 7:15.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dining Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch / Dinner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will plan to stop for lunch or dinner after the hike.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Providence, RI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take Route 146 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merge Right onto Route 290 East.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merge Right onto Route 190 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continue onto MA 2 West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take Exit 31B for MA 12 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow MA 12 North to US 202 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn Right onto US 202 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Left onto NH 124 West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right Dublin Road (sign for Mt. Monadnock).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Left onto Poole Rd.  Use caution in snow/ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trails and Other Info&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start at the park headquarters and follow the White Dot Trail to the summit.  Expect a lot of ice on the upper sections of this trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After enjoying the views from the summit, we'll follow the White Dot Trail back to its junction with White Cross.  Note that there is a long smooth granite slab on this stretch that is frequently covered with ice. Traction will be required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will then take the White Cross Trail down, rejoining the White Dot Trail about 1/2 mile from the trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an official &lt;a href="http://www.nhstateparks.org/uploads/pdf/MonadnockHikingTrailsMap_All_2010.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Mount Monadnock State Park Trail Map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide my cell phone number to all &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; RSVPs the week of the hike. Note that my cell phone number has changed, so if you already have a number saved for me, please update it when you get this e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note about Yak Trax&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yak Trax recently released a style of traction support similar to Microspikes and Hillsounds.  Within the last week, however, I have received three separate reports of these new Yak Trax failing.  Two of those situations resulted in falls.  Since three separate hikers have recently found them unreliable, they are not considered suitable traction devices for hikes that I lead up north.  Apologies to anyone that purchased Yak Trax, however your safety and the safety of the group as a whole is paramount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, the following devices are considered suitable traction options for hiking up north.  Note that neither Hillsound Trail Crampons nor Katoola Microspikes are a substitute for full crampons in all conditions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hillsound Trail Crampons&lt;br /&gt;Katoola Microspikes&lt;br /&gt;full Crampons (numerous brands)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liability Waiver&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you for yourself, your heirs, executors, and administrators release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Grey Hyundai Sonata with RI License Plates.  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Correia</member_name><member_id>8033800</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294174198000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293309917000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mount Monadnock via White Dot / White CrossTrails</name><id>15818372</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293978600000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/15818372/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/c/global_5586652.jpeg</photo_url></item>
