However, we're sorry, but the Barbecue &amp;amp; rally are full and registration for the full day is closed. You can still come for the rides by paying $5 when your register just show up.  If you are interested in staying for the barbecue you may be able to substitute for any registered participants who are unable to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, or perhaps its good news for some of you who weren't doing it because of the costs...  Happy Peddaling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyndi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Everyone I have signed up for the AMC Bike Rally along with a few friends and I thought their might be some others in this group interested in doing it too!  So I decided to post it here:  I'll bring a balloon with me so you can find me before and after ride.  &lt;b&gt;I believe I am doing the 27 mile ride, may add a few on to that!  50 is a little to far for me right now!  That way even if we don't ride together perhaps we can do some socializing together afterwards as a group.  Should be a blast.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amcboston.org/bicycle/bikerally.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amcboston....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 32nd annual AMC Boston Chapter Bicycle Rally will be held at the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friendly Crossways Hostel&lt;br /&gt;247 Littleton County Road&lt;br /&gt;Harvard, MA 01451 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on Saturday, June 12, 2010.
