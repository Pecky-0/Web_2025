Let's hike to several High Peaks in Maine together!!   &lt;br /&gt;The mountains which I highlighted in &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; are listed in NE 4K footers and in &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; are listed as NE HH (New England 100 Highest).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cross posted event from my own hiking meetup - &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/hiking-490"&gt;Hike/Snowshoe Vermont Meetup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Day-2 hiking event description to peakbag 2 particular mountains, &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Saddleback Mountain (4120 ft) and The Horn (4041 ft)&lt;/span&gt; at Southeast of Rangeley. The bare summit of both offer far-flung views in all directions.  However, high winds and restricted visibility can be dangerous and trail is difficult to follow in bad weather since its widespread areas are above treeline.  &lt;br /&gt;You can join us only one of my Maine hiking events or all which is up to you.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Hiking Plan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This is round trip hike which doesn't require car spot. &lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking lot of Saddleback Ski Area on Saddleback Mountain Road, Rangeley, ME &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;at 7:00AM.&lt;/span&gt;  Many people may choose to hike on AT because these 2 mountains are on it, however, this event uses ski trails to hike in to Saddleback from northwestern side such that we can save a couple of hiking mileage.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) We'll start hike at &lt;u&gt;7:15AM sharp&lt;/u&gt;.  Here is my brief plan to take multiple ski trails.   &lt;br /&gt;Please take a look at the hiking description with &lt;a href="http://www.saddlebackmaine.com/downloads/saddleback_trailmap_2009.pdf"&gt;the Saddleback Ski Trail map&lt;/a&gt; for your reference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* After park our cars at the parking lot, we pass near the Lodge, take &lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Wheeler&lt;/span&gt; to hike in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;* Gray Ghost &lt;br /&gt;* The Pass &lt;br /&gt;* Jitterbug &lt;br /&gt;* Hudson Highway &lt;br /&gt;* Tri-Color&lt;/span&gt; to summit of Saddleback, then, to AT to peakbag The Horn. &lt;br /&gt;* We'll return with the same path to the parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Hiking Level:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Moderate  &lt;br /&gt;Hiking Distance:  I don't know the accurate mileage since we'll use ski trails.  I assume the distance will be less than 14 miles round trip.  &lt;br /&gt;Hiking Pace:  Slow to Moderate &lt;br /&gt;Hiking Hours: 8 hours + Lunch 30min + Break Time (Of course, hiking hours varies depending on your hiking pace) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Suggested Meetup Locations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) We'll meet at the parking lot of Saddleback ski area &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;at 7AM&lt;/span&gt;. (See the above link to see Saddleback ski area).  The parking lot is located at the right hand side from the Lodge on this map.  I assume the Parking lot is located South side from the Lodge, although I've never been there.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I booked Town &amp;amp; Lake Motel in Rangeley to stay 9/9 night.  You can stay at Maine Roadhouse which si a bit far but cheap. (40-50min drive to the trailhead, Bunk room is $20 per night)   This is about 20-25 min away from the trailhead by car. We can possibly meet there at &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;6:35AM&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maineroadhouse.com/"&gt;Main Roadhouse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;910 Rangeley Rd &lt;br /&gt;Stratton, ME &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other nearby locations to stay overnight: &lt;br /&gt;* &lt;a href="http://www.thestrattonmotel.com/"&gt;Stratton Motel  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thestrattonmotel.com/"&gt;http://www.thestratto...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* Gull Pond Lodge, 8min from Saddleback ski area 207-864-5563 &lt;br /&gt;* Farmhouse Inn, Rangeley ME 207-864-5805 &lt;br /&gt;* Town &amp;amp; Lake Motel and Cottages, 112 Main St, Rangeley, ME 207-864-3755 &lt;br /&gt;* Loon Lodge, 309 Pickford Rd, Rangeley, ME 207-864-5666 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=ME-16+E%2FRangeley+Rd%2FStratton+Rd&amp;amp;daddr=Saddleback+Mountain+Rd&amp;amp;geocode=FUomsAId63XM-w%3BFR7SrQIddNPL-w&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;mra=dme&amp;amp;mrcr=0&amp;amp;mrsp=1&amp;amp;sz=14&amp;amp;sll=44.948217,-70.536604&amp;amp;sspn=0.053214,0.047636&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=44.948277,-70.53669&amp;amp;spn=0.106427,0.095272&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;z=13"&gt;the google map from Maine Roadhouse to Saddleback Ski area.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to drop me an email.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer,    &lt;br /&gt;Tomoko Nakajima&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My Car is Honda CR-V (Blue)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tomoko</member_name><member_id>8122788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284393053000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281324408000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Multiple Day-Hiking Events in Maine - Day 2: Saddleback Mtn &amp; The Horn</name><id>14362407</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284116400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14362407/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/8/c/global_17055980.jpeg</photo_url></item>
