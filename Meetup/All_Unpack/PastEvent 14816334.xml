<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizer Michael Blair @ 9788081932&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year I adopted a section of the Appalachian Trail on behalf of the Random Group of Hikers.  We adopted the 3.3 mile section of the Kinsman Ridge Trail between Route 112 in North Woodstock, NH and Gordon Pond. By adopting this section of the AT we assume the responsibility for performing basic maintenance at regular intervals. We will NOT be performing trail maintenance on this trip, rather it will be our first time on the trail so I thought we could take a leisurely stroll to see what work might need to be done before winter.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most of the hikes that I organize, I have never hiked on these trails or climbed to these summits. I did all of my research using a trail guide, a trail map, or the Internet. The link(s) below provide an overview of where we will be going and include topographic maps of the area. You should become familiar with this information since you are ultimately responsible for your own safety.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=29987" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more information about our route from Peakbagger.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you plan to participate in this event you must answer the questions for you and any guests when you RSVP YES or MAYBE - if you don't answer them your RSVP will be removed by the organizer.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP up-to-date - if your plans be considerate and change your RSVP. If you don't have a ride RSVP MAYBE until you have arranged for a ride - only RSVP YES once you have a confirmed ride. I will change all MAYBE RSVPs to NO four days before the event so people who are on the WAITING LIST have an opportunity to participate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trip Summary:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We will follow the Kinsman Ridge Trail from the parking area to its junction with the Gordon Pond Trail and then follow the same route in reverse to return. We will not be climbing to a summit on this hike. &lt;b&gt;On this moderate pace trip we will hike about 6.6 miles and climb about 1,200 feet. It is considered INTERMEDIATE because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the objective of this trip is to enjoy ourselves as we climb as a group, your safety, and the safety of the others in the group, is the most important thing. If you underestimate the demands of this trip, or overestimate your skills and abilities, you may put yourself and/or others at risk - consider this before you decide if you are going to participate.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker in the group. If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you. Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ANY questions about your ability to participate in and complete this entire trip please contact me.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Reaching the summit is optional, getting down is mandatory.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;(Ed Viesturs on the dangers of mountaineering)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are welcome on this hike provided they are under voice control, you bring a leash in case you need to use it, and you bring a copy of their most recent rabies vaccination.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dangerous weather conditions will cancel this hike - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=North+Woodstock&amp;amp;state=NH&amp;amp;site=GYX&amp;amp;textField1=44.0121&amp;amp;textField2=-71.738&amp;amp;e=0" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for the current weather forecast for this trip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing and Equipment:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Below is a list describing the minimum clothing and equipment required to participate in this event. DO NOT rely on others to have extra clothing or equipment to share with you once we are out on the trails.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Footwear: Hiking boots or trail shoes.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clothing: Dress in layers to easily regulate body temperature.

You will need to bring any medications or medical supplies that you may need during the trip.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We will begin this hike at 9:00 AM from the Kinsman Ridge Trail parking area located along Route 112 in North Woodstock, NH. According to Google Maps this meeting spot is about 137 miles from Boston and it should take about 2 hours 23 minutes to drive there.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://local.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Boston,+MA&amp;amp;daddr=44.040808,-71.791763(Kinsman+Ridge+Trailhead+%5Bsouth%5D)&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FZ9WhgIdw7bD-ykbMT0NLWXjiTGg6GIBJL98eA%3BFWgCoAIdbYu4-w&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;sll=44.040808,-71.791763&amp;amp;sspn=0.007435,0.019205&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=8" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for driving directions to the meeting spot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please indicate in your RSVP if you need a ride or can offer one - you are responsible for coordinating your own car pool arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Blair</member_name><member_id>3942422</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Monica Trust</member_name><member_id>4555776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285630486000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284845454000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Explopre our Adopted Trail (Moderate Hike)</name><id>14816334</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285506000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/14816334/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/7/global_15580391.jpeg</photo_url></item>
