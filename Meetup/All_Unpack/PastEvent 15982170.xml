He is joined by pianist Russell Sherman, Distinguished Artist-in-Residence, for the Gershwin Concerto in F. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about this concert, go to &lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-philharmonia-wolff-1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/nec-philharmonia-wolff-1" target="_blank"&gt;http://necmusic.edu/n...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm, but let's meet up at 7:30, so the group has a chance to get good seats and socialize before the concert.  We usually end up sitting in the back full row of the center floor section, since this affords a good view of the entire orchestra, is open to the ceiling, and is easy to describe and find.  However, if the balcony is open, I try to grab a section on the left side as it affords a really good view of the orchestra, it's easier to seat a large group there, and the acoustics are still amazing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Due to Meetup's recent terrible decision to remove the Maybe option, please indicate whether you are a maybe in your Yes RSVP.&lt;/span&gt; (and please sign &lt;a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/mumaybe/petition.html" target="_blank"&gt;this petition&lt;/a&gt; if you want to register your displeasure with that decision!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Jordan Hall: &lt;br /&gt;The hall is located at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=jordan+Hall,+Boston+MA&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=59.467068,135.263672&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.342781,-71.085577&amp;amp;spn=0.006883,0.020599&amp;amp;z=17" target="_blank"&gt;the corner of Huntington and Gainsborough streets&lt;/a&gt;, about a block south of the Symphony T stop on the Green Line.
