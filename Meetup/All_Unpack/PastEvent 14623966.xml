The group has had a very successful 1st season, helping 8 Bluebirds, 75 Tree Swallows, and 7 House Wrens successfully fledge! It's now time to do the housecleaning that will allow bird parents to raise healthy babies again next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at MSSF Headquarters and carpool to Cutter's Field. We will pull the boxes and their poles out of the ground, dump out the old nests and load the boxes into a truck. We will take the boxes back to the Headquarters' picnic area where we will scrub them and apply wood sealer. This is dirty work. Please bring rubber gloves, and dress to walk safely in tick infested fields. Sound like fun? The work may be tedious and gross (I know because I just cleaned the two boxes in my yard), but think of the wonderful results! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make it at 11:00 a.m., come help later at the Headquarters. We'll probably work till 2:00 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a truck and people wearing blue face-filter masks (just kidding)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melissa </member_name><member_id>9473646</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284829534000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283378220000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bird Box Take-down, Cleaning and Sealing</name><id>14623966</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284735600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/14623966/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/2/global_14185426.jpeg</photo_url></item>
