You can also take the orange to Roxbury Crossing and it's not a bad walk, and I happen to like the coffee shop in that T station, but I digress. It can take a little while to find on-street parking but there are usually some spaces on Huntington or Tremont, a few blocks from Brigham Circle. I will get to the pub by 7:30 and I'll post what I'm wearing on the day of the match (no, I don't plan my outfit nine days out). Match starts at 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy Hersh</member_name><member_id>8018901</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1360815542000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Trivia Buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Area-Pub-Trivia</urlname><id>1554091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Boston Area Pub Trivia</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360009590000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>play at Squealing Pig</name><id>102999002</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1360803600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Pub-Trivia/events/102999002/</event_url></item>
