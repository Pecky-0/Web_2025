 &lt;br /&gt;

How about an afternoon of ice skating? I will be going to Conway Skating Arena and hope that some of you will join me! Itâ€™s always so much more fun when we do things as a group. &lt;br /&gt;

The public skating takes place at 2:30 and last two hours. Feel free to join us anytime between 2:30 and 4:30. After the event, we will decide on a nearby venue for a hot drink, snack or light meal and great conversation with good company. &lt;br /&gt;

Please remember to wear layers and gloves, so that you will stay comfortable and warm. I hope to see you there! Call my cell if you need to. 603-247-0897. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Admission is $5.00, rentals are $4.00. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you will be renting skates, I recommend that you bring extra socks, to be sure that your feet are "cushioned" comfortably into the skates. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Directions: From the Everett Turnpike, take exit 5 in the direction of Hollis. Take right on Riverside Dr. Take first left on Stadium Dr. &lt;br /&gt;
