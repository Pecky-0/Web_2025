In just nine weeks after its release in France on 2 November 2011 it became the second most successful French film of all time (in number of viewers) in the French box office [...] The movie relates the development of the improbable friendship between Philippe, a wealthy tetraplegic, and Driss, a young and poor man from the ghettos, who is hired as his live-in carer. The film begins at night in Paris. Driss is driving Philippe's Maserati Quattroporte at full speed, with Philippe in the front passenger's seat. They are soon chased by the police. &amp;quot;I bet you 100 euros I shake them off,&amp;quot; Driss tells his passenger. When they are caught, Driss, unfazed, doubles his bet with Philippe, convinced they will get an escort. In order to get away with his speeding, Driss claims the tetraplegic Philippe must be urgently driven to the emergency room; Philippe pretends to have a stroke and the fooled police eventually escort them to the hospital. The two men are jubilant. As the police leave them at the hospital Driss says &amp;quot;Now let me take care of it,&amp;quot; and they drive off. The feel-good dramatic comedy has become a cultural phenomenon in France where it was voted the cultural event of 2011 with 52% votes. [description from Wikipedia] It is based on the book &amp;quot;You Changed My Life&amp;quot; by Abdel Sellou. Winner of the San Francisco International Film Festival's Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature. In French, with English subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Showtime 6:50pm.
