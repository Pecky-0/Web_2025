&lt;p&gt;This workshop is a great opportunity for those who are knowledgeable of the Enneagram basics and want to learn about it in more detail with others who share the same fascination!
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;* If you are attending please already know the basics of the nine Enneagram types, wings and the three instinctual subtypes.&lt;/strong&gt; If you understand the basics (just listed) then you should be fine - it will be new material but explained in a way that it is easy to understand.*
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in attending, please RSVP soon (not at the last minute). The more people who RSVP, the more others will want to also attend.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and/or share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Herb always has great snacks.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The workshop starts at 7:30pm, thus allowing plenty of time to enjoy the summer weather. 
&lt;strong&gt;Then, come inside and cool off in Herb&amp;rsquo;s air conditioned studio.&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Great food, company and an interesting topic - an awesome way to spend a Friday night!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324617608000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309498116000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Advanced Enneagram - Sequences, Triads and Parent's Type</name><id>24194771</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310167800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/24194771/</event_url></item>
