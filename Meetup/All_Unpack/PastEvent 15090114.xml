If you attended every book club discussion this year and read every book you would end up with &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: navy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; books read for the year (In all fairness I think I read about 10 and faked a few:)). If you were really good and read both books you would have read 24 books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Congratulations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather you read one book, read some of the books, did not read any book at all, simply curious to see what we all look like, please join us for the end of year celebration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please share with me any ideas on a spot to go to. I am tempted to try for Northampton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can all make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abdul&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abdul</member_name><member_id>2464273</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292701992000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286928296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of Year Celebration</name><id>15090114</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292632200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/15090114/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/d/6/global_20038822.jpeg</photo_url></item>
