<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of chitchat, let's seek out deep, serious conversations in which we can focus on a single topic of mutual interest. This is our first try of this kind of meet up, so we are open to topic suggestions. Our first meet up topic is "giving back to community."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I want substantive conversations with like minded people ." You are not alone. Ying and me met through this group and we had good time exchanging stimulating conversations over lunch or tea, we thought that we should share our experience with other like minded Asian women in this group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is my first time organize a meetup, so I wanted to treat each lady a crepe or drink at this nice cafe. The cafe is located at second floor of Natick Collection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
