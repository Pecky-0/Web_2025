Many moons ago, I asked a coworker where I could find some good Polish grub.  She called up 4 of her Polish friends and they all recommended Staropolska.  I have eaten there once and can't wait to go back.  &lt;br /&gt;My grandmother used to make pierogies all the time and the ones at this restaurant were the closest I've ever had that tasted like hers.  &lt;br /&gt;I couldn't pronounce any of the names of the Polish beers but they were tasty too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.staropolska.net" target="_blank"&gt;www.staropolska.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184364718000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182430773000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pierogies and Potato Pancakes at Staropolska</name><id>5917286</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184191200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/5917286/</event_url></item>
