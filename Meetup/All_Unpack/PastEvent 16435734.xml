&lt;p&gt;For those who have never  attended a traditional game night, we  usually split up in different  rooms or areas to play smaller games of  players' choice and then come  together for a larger game or two at the  end of the night. However,  sometimes we just play large party games for  the majority of the  evening. It depends on the mood of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You should know  that we are a household with cats (one of whom is  the  Official Cat of Salem!), but they will be locked up for the  evening. The  house is also home to a hopefully well-behaved 2 year old,  who will  obviously not be locked up for the evening, but she will be  in bed for the later part of the Meetup. We also have an infant, who  isn't much of a game player, as he just eats and sleeps all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it  is tight. There is  generally more parking available toward Orne St., and  more parking is  available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301596058000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296783670000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Traditional Game Night</name><id>16435734</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301176800000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/16435734/</event_url></item>
