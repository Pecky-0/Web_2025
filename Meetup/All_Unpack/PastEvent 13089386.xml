It ascends gradually along  fairly rough footing then descends a short, steep pitch. the trail crosses Avalanche Brook at the foot of the falls then climbs a steep slope by switchbacks to the top of Ripley Falls. In dry weather, the water flow is rather low. The rocks just off the path near the falls are dangerously slippery and should be avoided. &lt;br /&gt; to Ripley Falls &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 0.50 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 20 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +370 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -56 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +314 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 1.20 mi/40 min/+674 ft on the Arethusa-Ripley Falls Trail &lt;br /&gt; From the top of Ripley Falls, which are about 100 ft. high, the trail follows a narrow rooty path across a steep slope. The trail crosses a small brook and then begins to climb. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Frankenstein Cliff Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.60 mi/27 min/-107 ft on the Frankenstein Cliff Trail &lt;br /&gt; to Falcon Cliff &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.20 mi/12 min/-186 ft on the Frankenstein Cliff Trail &lt;br /&gt; Frankenstein Cliff Trail begins at its junction with the Arethusa-Ripley Falls Trail. The trail gradually winds upward then ascends to the ridge.  It passes an outlook to Mt. Washington over the Dry River Valley. Near the height-of-land the trail levels off and then begins a gradual descent, passing just south of the summit of a small knob. At one point, there is a view of Arethusa Falls far up at the head of the valley. A spur path called the Falcon Cliff Trail diverges left and ascends north, first easily then more steeply, through a brushy hardwood area; then it turns sharp right, runs along the edge of a wooded bluff, and makes a short descent at to a partially open south-facing viewpoint on the top of a crag called Falcon Cliff, with a 200-ft. climb from the main trail. The trail descends gradually through a fine stand of spruce, skirting the tops of the cliffs, with views of the valley and Mt. Bemis. &lt;br /&gt; to Frankenstein Cliff &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 2.50 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 1 hr 39 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +1373 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -678 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +696 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 0.20 mi/12 min/+186 ft on the Frankenstein Cliff Trail &lt;br /&gt; Leaving the outlook, the trail ascends gradually through a fine stand of spruce in a west-northwest direction, skirting the top of the cliffs, with views of the valley and Mt. Bemis. A spur path called the Falcon Cliff Trail diverges right and ascends north, first easily then more steeply, through a brushy hardwood area; then it turns sharp right, runs along the edge of a wooded bluff, and makes a short descent at to a partially open south-facing viewpoint on the top of a crag called Falcon Cliff, with a 200-ft. climb from the main trail. The main trail continues to ascend and passes just south of the summit of a small knob. At one point, there is a view of Arethusa Falls far up at the head of the valley. Near the height-of-land the trail levels off, passes an outlook to Mt. Washington over the Dry River Valley, then descends the ridge for a short distance and winds gradually downward to meet the Arethusa–Ripley Falls Trail. &lt;br /&gt; to Falcon Cliff &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.60 mi/27 min/+107 ft on the Frankenstein Cliff Trail &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Arethusa-Ripley Falls Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 1.10 mi/52 min/-338 ft on the Arethusa-Ripley Falls Trail &lt;br /&gt; The trail heads southeast across a plateau then passes the junction on the left with the Frankenstein Cliff Trail.

Turn right and descend more than 100 ft. on a spur trail to reach the falls; for the best views, one must cross Bemis Brook, which is potentially difficult in the high-water conditions when the falls are most impressive. The Arethusa Falls Trail continues across one of two bridges over tributary brooks. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Bemis Brook Trail &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 5.60 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 4 hr 7 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2361 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -2134 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +227 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 0.40 mi/23 min/-352 ft on the Arethusa Falls Trail &lt;br /&gt; Arethusa Falls Trail crosses the second of the two tributary brooks and turns onto a relocated section.  The new route descends moderately on a well-constructed footway, following an old logging road. The trail turns left off of the relocated section and passes the first junction with the Bemis Brook Trail on the right. The Bemis Brook Trail provides an attractive but rougher alternative route closer to the brook. &lt;br /&gt; to the junction of Bemis Brook Trail &lt;br /&gt; hike 0.10 mi/5 min/-51 ft on the Arethusa Falls Trail &lt;br /&gt; The trail follows old roads above the north bank of Bemis Brook.  It passes a spur path to the right that leads off to some cascades.  The trail crosses the railroad and terminates at the parking area. &lt;br /&gt; to Arethusa Falls Trailhead &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 6.10 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 4 hr 35 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2361 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -2537 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change -177 ft &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1271079928000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270470380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RIPLEY TO ARETHUSA FALLS</name><id>13089386</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270906200000</time><rsvp_limit>3</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/13089386/</event_url></item>
