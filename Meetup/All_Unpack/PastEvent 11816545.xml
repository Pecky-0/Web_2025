So we'll be heading there for our November Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is now a $5 charge for the use of the Dogtopia facility.  Please bring $5 with you on the day of the Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some general info about services offered at Dogtopia: They offer 4 large playrooms, and the little guys have a space that is separate from the larger breeds. The space is cool in the summer...and warm in the winter. Their playroom floors are thickly rubber padded, so the dogs can run without slipping or risking any injury. They also offer &amp;quot;spa treatments&amp;quot;, a self-serve dog wash area, training, and overnight stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you may not see the facility right away. Once you reach the Endicott Plaza, drive behind the Market Basket store. You will see a large blue awning with the &amp;quot;Dogtopia&amp;quot; logo. If you see that... then you have arrived!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Please bring plenty of pooper-scooper bags to pick up after your dog. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you then!&lt;br /&gt;laura &amp;amp; molly&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258477685000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257561201000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel November Meetup</name><id>11816545</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258304400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/11816545/</event_url></item>
