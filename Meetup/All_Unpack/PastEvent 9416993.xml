We will walk through both. Carpooling is necessay because there is parking for 4 cars only and roadside parking is not permitted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Property Description: &lt;br /&gt;Peters Reservation, named for the family who, in 1917, purchased the property as a family retreat, is dominated by an oak and hickory forest, whose trails and understory plantings were laid out by landscape architect Fletcher Steele.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plantation of red pines lines much of the Reservation's frontage on the Charles River. Over two miles of trails traverse woodlands featuring a large, massed planting of Dexter hybrid rhododendrons. A short trail extension on the other side of Farm Street links Peters Reservation to Chase Woodlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Get There: &lt;br /&gt;By car: From Dover Center, follow Springdale Ave. west for 0.8 mi. Turn left onto Farm St. and follow for 1.8 mi. to entrance and parking (strict 4-car limit) on left. This parking area serves both Chase Woodlands and Peters Reservation. Roadside parking is not permitted in Dover.&lt;br /&gt; I will be at the little cafe in Dover center at 10:15 to shuttle folks to the reservation.  I can fit 4 people in my car. &lt;br /&gt;Lunch afterwards at Sel De La Terre &lt;br /&gt;1245 Worcester Street, Natick, MA 01760 â€¢ 508 650 1800 &lt;br /&gt;seldelaterre.com&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim</member_name><member_id>3553414</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234213446000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230778252000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk at Peters Reservation </name><id>9416993</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234020600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9416993/</event_url></item>
