Egg custards and jasmine tea and stuff you can't pronounce unless you speak Mandarin or Cantonese! CHICKEN FEET!!! Join us for our now-monthly, all-social dimsum events, which will take place at one restaurant or another in Boston's Chinatown. We can talk geek, or just eat ourselves silly. Alas, this is probably not for the vegetarian'd, or the strictly kosher or halal, or the diet-conscious. The bill will be split evenly among all who attend, so the more the merrier/cheaper! (Cost is usually less than $15 per person.)

The number of people who can do dimsum on Saturday outweighs the number who can do it on Sunday, so it looks like we'll have to stick to Saturday for now.  However, we will alternate locations.  We've tried Hei La Moon and China Pearl; this month we're going to try Empire Garden, also known as Emperor's Garden.  A couple of us tried it in April and we think it's the best so far.
