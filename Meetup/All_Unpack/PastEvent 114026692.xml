Do you have racing thoughts? Do you experience anxiety, fear, anger too easily or too often? Do you have a significant life event occurring at this time? A meditative or healthy state of mind is important to live in during a challenging circumstance and occurs in many different ways, yet the basic mechanics occurring within is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, they experience a meditative state of mind when doing a yoga posture. For others, they experience a meditative state of mind while smoking a cigarette. For others, they can be in a meditative state of mind while listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is truly occurring inside.... in each of these circumstances is the individual allows his or her mind to clear, relax, fully open. The individual is not encouraging Thought to occur within, or thinking. The individual is not focused on labeling the circumstance or experience good, bad or anything. The individual is simply allowing his or herself to experience the experience or circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
