<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This rehearsal serves principally toward getting our regulars ready for their first upcoming performance. At the outset of our rehearsal, we will quickly address scheduling issues concerning upcoming rehearsals and live performances. After the business, we'll refine our show for the debut performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this rehearsal is geared for the performing cast, it is open to anyone interested in participating. New members can participate in warm ups and drills and play the valuable role of offering audience feedback. Depending on your skill level, you may join our cast for upcoming performances this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246223214000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244224977000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rehearsal: Back into the swing of things</name><id>10584818</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244415600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/10584818/</event_url></item>
