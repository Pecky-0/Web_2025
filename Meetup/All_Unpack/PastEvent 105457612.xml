 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;If you answered "yes" to either of these questions, then you're going to love this.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;I've got a brand new event for you called Games Night.  It's a unique kind of social event where the focus is on playing games that create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;interesting conversations&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;profound connections&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;with some warm and amazing people (and almost all of them will be single).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;By doing this you'll not only have a lot of fun, but you'll learn a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so much&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;about yourself and the people around you.  And on a practical level, you'll also learn tools that you can use in your everyday life (including your dates) to create a deep and lasting connections with others.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 By participating in these eye opening (and heart opening) exercises, you'll not only have a lot of fun, but you'll learn a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so much&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; about yourself and the people around you.  And on a practical level, you'll also learn tools that you can use in your everyday life (including your dates) to create a deep and lasting connections with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 ************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

 WHY COME TO GAMES NIGHT? &lt;br /&gt;

 *************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll discover how you are truly experienced by others, and how you can share your experience of others in a way that creates unforgettable connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll learn to navigate those moments when you're not sure what you're going to say next, and surprise yourself at how interesting, creative, and attractive you really are when you stop trying to manage how others see you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll learn how to share yourself more authentically in conversation, and that will be incredibly useful when you meet people at social gatherings and go on dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than having a night of boring small talk, you'll actually get real with the people you meet... giving you the kind of deep, connected experience we often hope for, but rarely experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll have a &lt;strong&gt;lot of fun&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Does that sound like music to your ears?  This is going to blow the lid off what you typically experience at a meetup event.  There is nothing like this anywhere in Boston, and I'm excited to create this together with you! &lt;br /&gt;

 HOW TO GET INVOLVED &lt;br /&gt;

 *************************************************  &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Where is it?&lt;/strong&gt; The seminar is conveniently located at the Watertown Center For Healing Arts which is a beautiful facility for an event like this. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;What time?&lt;/strong&gt; Please plan on arriving by 6:45pm so you have time to settle in and meet the other members. We start promptly at 7:00pm and go until 9:30pm (with a break in the middle).  There are plenty of bus lines that go to the center, and there is also lots of parking both on the street and in a big parking lot near the center.  The bottom of this page has details: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;a href="http://watertowncenter.net/directions-2/"&gt;http://watertowncenter.net/directions-2/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;How much?&lt;/strong&gt; Cheap.  We waste so much of our time and money on social events that don't bring us any real satisfaction.  This is an opportunity to have a truly satisfying experience and really connect with other single people who are eager to get to know you. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;So how much?&lt;/strong&gt; Because I want to help as many people as I can, I've decided to keep the price very affordable so that anyone who wants to come will be able to.  The cost for this event is only $20, which is very low considering what you're getting.  On top of that, I'll provide snacks and beverages for you. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Think about it... &lt;strong&gt;that's 67 cents a day for a month&lt;/strong&gt;.  What else do you spend 67 cents on every day that makes no difference in your life whatsoever? I promise that this will be well worth your time.  You'll learn so much about yourself, about others, and you'll also discover how you can share more of yourself in every conversation you get into moving forward. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;How big is the event?&lt;/strong&gt; Because we are going to be moving around, and doing lots of fun exercises, I have to limit this event to 30 people due to the size limitations of the room, and I've already got 10 coming from my other meetup group, so we have room for 20 more.  Be sure to put in your RSVP now in order to lock in your spot. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Please remember to bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pen to take notes on what you learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great attitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a willingness to try fun, new things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Go ahead and put in your RSVP right now in order to secure your spot.  I'm looking forward to seeing you there. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Warmly,   &lt;br /&gt;

 Jason &lt;br /&gt;
