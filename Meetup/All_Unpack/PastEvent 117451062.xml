No rebuys. Blinds will go up every 25 minutes. If we have 9 players only we will be paying out top two spots. If we have ten or more we will pay out top three spots. This is a very friendly easy going game...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game will start NO LATER than 1:45pm. We expect players to be on time otherwise we will put their blinds in for them. If you do not show up by 2pm and your blind is in...we will consider you a no show and you will be eliminated from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** We need a minimum of 9 players for this game otherwise it will be cancelled **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who is out early we do have board games if interested?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide light snacks and soda. Feel free to bring a snack to share. We do not have any pets for those of you with allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking logistics. Please park in the rear of all the buildings and use the FRONT door only.
