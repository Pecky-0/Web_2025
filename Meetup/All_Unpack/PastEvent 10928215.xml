Let's get those bicycles moving!!  We're planning to do the East Bay bike path this Saturday, the 1st of August, at 11AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to burn off some energy so that we can eat and drink at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/calendar/10892257/"&gt;pub night&lt;/a&gt; later that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long ride, but it will *NOT* be a fast one. This is not a race! It will be a fun ride at a comfortable pace. No need to be nervous if you are not a fast bicyclist. It's a social ride. If you want to just do a portion of the ride, feel free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just as much about meeting some nice folks as it is about enjoying some fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is raining â€“ I will reschedule for another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The East Bay bike path is 14.5 miles of paved bike path from Bristol to Providence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at Colt State Park in Bristol, Rhode Island&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE remember to take my cell phone number: 401-699-7304 in case you can't find us. As usual, I will be sporting my signature red road bike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a joint meetup with the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Bicycling/calendar/10927729/"&gt;Providence Bicycle meetup&lt;/a&gt; Please do not sign up with both meetups.  Just pick one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red road bike.
