&lt;p&gt;When I was a little girl in Korea, all of the neighborhood &lt;em&gt;ajummas&lt;/em&gt; would gather at my grandmother's house and turn out hundreds of dumplings. When they were done, we would eat some right then (fresh dumplings are awesome!), and the rest would be divvied up and frozen for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't think of an Asian culture that does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a dumpling, so let's get together and make all different kinds. When we're done we'll have a dumpling feast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a large home with a kitchen that's good for multiple people working at the same time, it would be great for you to host! Otherwise we'll do it at my place.&lt;/p&gt;
