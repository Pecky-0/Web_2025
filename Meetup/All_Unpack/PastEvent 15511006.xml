Fair warning... this is another long novel, so don't wait until the last minute to read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the book jacket....  &lt;br /&gt;We all remember certain sweeping novels we hated to see come to an end; it was almost like breaking up with someone we love. You will feel that way about _The Far Pavillions_. From the foothills of the Himalayas, through the palaces of the exotic East, this novel is a passionate and triumphant story that excites us, fill us with joy, moves us to tears, and helps us reme  more &amp;raquo; mber just what it is we want most from a novel. It is a mesmerizing story of hatred and bitter combat; of courage, and human sacrifice, of the star-crossed wedding of East and West. Above all it is a tale of love. The story of Ash, an Englishman, and Juli, a princess who must choose between the heritage of her people and the man she loves. It is a story that transcends time and place, a monumental epic we will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorothy Drennen</member_name><member_id>2879015</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300106944000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Indian Bookwalas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-1439</urlname><id>1261834</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Indian Food, Indian Fiction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290285704000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March 2011:  The Far Pavillions, by M M Kaye</name><id>15511006</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299949200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-1439/events/15511006/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/4/global_5395668.jpeg</photo_url></item>
