The readings themselves will only take up 10-20 minutes of the program. Most of the evening takes the form of a lively conversation in which we explore questions at the intersection of politics and culture (questions of language and history, the role of the artist in society, etc.). The event is free and open to the public and will be followed by a reception. A self-taught poet, Don Paterson was born in 1963 in Dundee, Scotland. He moved to London in 1984 to work as a jazz musician, and began writing poetry around the same time. His collections of poetry include God&amp;#146;s Gift to Women (Faber, 1997), Landing Light (Faber, 2003; Graywolf, 2004), and Rain (Faber, 2009; Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2010). His first collection, Nil Nil (1993) won the Forward Prize for best first collection, God's Gift to Women won both the T.S. Eliot Prize and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, and Landing Light won the Whitbread Poetry Prize and an unprecedented second T.S. Eliot Prize. Paterson teaches poetry at the University of St Andrews, and since 1996 has been poetry editor at Picador MacMillan. He continues to perform as a jazz guitarist. The conversation will be moderated by Dan Chiasson, poetry critic at The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine. Chiasson teaches poetry writing at Wellesley College and is the author of three books of poems, including Natural History (Knopf, 2005) and Where&amp;#146;s the Moon, There&amp;#146;s the Moon (Knopf, 2010). This event takes place as part of an ongoing series of conversations with artists and writers exploring questions of language, culture, nation, history, and the role of the poet in society. Co-sponsored by the Boston University Center for the Humanities, the Department of English, and the literary journal AGNI.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332957000000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331768067000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reading and conversation with Don Paterson and Dan Chiasson</name><id>56387452</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332885600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/56387452/</event_url></item>
