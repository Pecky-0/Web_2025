Over the years, Collins has met with literally thousands of these idea people, some of whom call themselves inventors and a great many more who are simply innovative thinkers, creative problem solvers, or average Joes with a light bulb moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through BIG, Collins has worked with many of these everyday experts, helping them get their products shown and sometimes licensed to companies that previously showed no interest in getting help from outside the walls of their own research and development laboratories.

He is also the author of The Million-Dollar Idea in Everyone, published by John Wiley. Mike is a serial entrepreneur, having launched six businesses, including Kid Galaxy, a specialty toy company and producer of the award-winning Bendos line and his most recent venture, Rebound Driveway Marker with partner Arra David.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>SEC Training Room, lower level</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Cormier</member_name><member_id>6323188</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251934447000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246981841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Public Meeting for August</name><id>10821727</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249512300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/10821727/</event_url></item>
