The concert is scheduled to begin at 8:30pm, seating will begin at 4:00pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the meeting time to 6:00pm.  My cell is 781-462-5817&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am changing the meeting place based on a suggestion I received.  We will meet at the just outside Savenor's Market located at 160 Charles St.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.savenorsmarket.com/onlinemarket/index.php?main_page=page&amp;amp;id=28&amp;amp;chapter=0" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.savenorsma...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be easier to find one another there as opposed to dealing with the crowd at the Esplanade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so here's the final word:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 6:00pm on Saturday July 3 at Savenor's Market located at 160 Charles Street in Boston.  It is close to the charles Street Red Line stop.  From there we can walk over to the Esplanade.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be waiting near the snack stand.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nancy</member_name><member_id>4131185</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278271598000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271040198000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Pops July 4 Rehearsal at the Hatch Memorial Shell</name><id>13154744</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278194400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/13154744/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/6/b/global_14314971.jpeg</photo_url></item>
