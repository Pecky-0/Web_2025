<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Let's bring attention to the anti-liberty, nonconservative record of Mitt Romney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be a lot of press at this event, as Mitt Romney is scheduled to officially announce his running the day before. How big a group of liberty-supporters could we have there making use of the press coverage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign Ideas: &lt;br /&gt;* Did you forget about RomneyCare? &lt;br /&gt;* True conservatives don't support gun control. &lt;br /&gt;* Romney, Taxachusetts called. They want their RINO back. &lt;br /&gt;* New Hampshire &amp;ne; Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**** NOTE: This event is not in support of any one candidate, but rather to call attention to the lack of conservative principles that Mitt Romney has shown. I would advise against bringing signs that promote a specific candidate, lest those who may be upset by our criticisms form negative associations. Our goal is solely to encourage those attending to think critically.&lt;/p&gt;
