Join us for a nice brunch over at West End Johnnies with the lovely sounds of The Conscious Band, playing your favorite reggae hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a dining meetup, I will need people to be certain they are coming if they are going to RSVP. This is one of the most popular brunches around town, and so seating is at a premium. So if 10 people RSVP, we will need 10 people to show up, out of respect for the group and the venue. It looks bad for the group if only 4 show up, but we reserved space for 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with those particulars out of the way, let's enjoy a relaxing brunch with food, drink, reggae music, and great conversation with other members.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lobby</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kenny Hyde</member_name><member_id>11634784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359346678000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>businessnetwork-960</urlname><id>1253532</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Professionals of Color Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357707343000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Reggae Brunch</name><id>98688692</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359310500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/businessnetwork-960/events/98688692/</event_url></item>
