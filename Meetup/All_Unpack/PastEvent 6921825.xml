(most likely not, but...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be our first meetup of 2008 so put your party hats on and be ready to play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of the cooking and baking that comes along with the holidays, please don't bring any food with you; we'll all take it easy and all chip in to order pizza (should you have gluten or dairy issues, if you bring something personal or a pizza, we can toss it in the oven).  Feel free to bring anything that you would like to drink, we will have some sodas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our house is on Lemon St. (it's the pumpkin colored one), and parking can be found on Lemon and Northey and most readily Cross St.  The house is the home of two cats, should you be allergic, but they are kept in a bedroom throughout the game nights.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great chance for those who have yet to attend a Meetup to get out and meet new people for the new year.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201410014000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197826980000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First 2008 Meetup!</name><id>6921825</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200097800000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/6921825/</event_url></item>
