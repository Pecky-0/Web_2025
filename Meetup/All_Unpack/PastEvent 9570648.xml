Woolsey Hall, corner of College and Grove, 8pm. This Friday's show is &amp;quot;a performance of Bruckner's massive Eighth Symphony, a work which contemporaries described as surpassing all of Bruckner's previous symphonies in 'intellectual scope, awesomeness, and greatness.' &amp;quot; The Philharmonic has performed not only at Carnegie Hall, but also in China last summer. The philharmonic's star French Horn player and New Haven Collective member Elizabeth Flemming will hopefully be joining us afterwards and can tell you all about it, when...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ...after that show, we head over to Cafe 9, where a mere $5 cover will get you into the 10:00 R&amp;amp;B/jazz display of guitar mastery at the George Baker Experience. 250 State Street, corner of state and crown. Another local musician told me this is a great show, and should draw a good crowd. Some of us were just there last week, andf its a cozy, cool little place where you can get good food and drinks without straining your wallet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come to one, the other, or both, but come! It should be a great night, hope to see you out!&lt;br /&gt;-Neil&lt;br /&gt;203-645-2008&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little more about the shows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.commerce.yale.edu/arts/music/series.do" target="_blank"&gt;https://apps.commerce...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cafenine.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cafenine.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://guitargeorgebaker.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://guitargeorgeba...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233011967000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232557697000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Music, and more music</name><id>9570648</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232757900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9570648/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
