The original site of the witch dungeons is actually below the phone company, however, they have re-created the dungeons to the specific measurements of the actual dungeons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dungeons were cold, and foul smelling, and were kept in total darkness, and the only light that was ever seen, was when the guards entered the dungeon. The dungeon was also near the north river, and during high tide would flood, and the cold water would rise to the prisoner?s ankles, daily. Most of the prisoners were kept in chains, and it was a stomping ground for large river rats. For the prisoners, who were poor, and could not afford to pay for their stay in the dungeon, they were put in coffin like cells, smaller than a phone booth, in which they could only stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour at the witch dungeons starts out with everyone going into the theater to read the story of the Salem witch trials on the plaques on the walls. Then there is a mini play, of a re-creation of an actual trial taken from real manuscripts that were found in the last several years. The play is done with the accusers and accused on stage, and the people in the crowd treated as those from Salem Town attending the trial.&lt;br /&gt;After the play, the tour guide will give some facts of what happened in Salem in 1692, and then everyone is taken down into the re-creation of the dungeons, to see how big the cells were, and the re-creation of things that happened. The tour ends in the gift shop, and pictures can be taken in the pillorys outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check out the link for the witch dungeons at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://cc.msnscache.com/cache.aspx?q=72892362922056&amp;amp;mkt=en-US&amp;amp;lang=en-US&amp;amp;w=ad73f83c&amp;amp;FORM=CVRE6" target="_blank"&gt;http://cc.msnscache.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will then be having lunch, at my favorite Salem Restaurant, Victoria Station, which is on the wharf, and specializes in Prime Rib and Sea Food and has the best prime rib sandwiches and chocolate mousse that I have ever tasted!
