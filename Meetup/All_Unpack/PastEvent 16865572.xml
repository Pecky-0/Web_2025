Second stop: the Prudential Center. There's a small group of tables right outside the Barnes and Noble -- near PF Chang's and the entrance to the Hynes Convention Center. There is wifi, coffee, and at least one electrical outlet (two up on the library from this week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a sign, but call if you get lost: Jess at 423 863 4344.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a work in progress and spend an hour or two writing with other writers.  Take the opportunity to discuss new ideas, encourage each other to meet self set goals, share websites and resources... Or just focus on your writing and see how much you can get done with a little dedicated time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess</member_name><member_id>9894327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300368742000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299718446000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Writing: NEW NEW LOCATION</name><id>16865572</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300313700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/16865572/</event_url></item>
