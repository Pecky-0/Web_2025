This beautiful and diverse terrain farm not only offers farm fields but also a golden rod field, fern floor forest, power grid corridor, old foundations, and a marsh path (which we may take if the group is into a little bush whacking). There are also some nice views from both the top farm field and power grid corridor. In past visits I have seen two white tail deer, 2 cooper hawks, and a red-tail hawk, frogs, and small snakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear good walking shoes, bring field guides, binocs and refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Property History&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1904, a young entrepreneur named Henry P. Kendall took over his uncle's failing cotton batting factory on the banks of the Neponset River in Walpole. During his lifetime, he transformed the factory into the large, multi-national Kendall Company. Mr. Kendall’s success enabled him to acquire and protect Moose Hill Farm, which housed a Guernsey dairy herd in the 1940’s, along with thousands of acres of woodlands in Sharon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moose Hill Farm's diverse landscape reveals how people have impacted the landscape during the past several centuries. Woodlands shelter mature American chestnuts, despite the blight that nearly wiped out this once dominant eastern forest presence. Cellar holes, foundation edges, stone walls, and open fields reflect agricultural trends in Massachusetts, which evolved from homestead to sheep farm to dairy during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be a $4.00 fee if you are not a Trustees Member. I have yet to see a collector on site. However the Trustees cause is very good and worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;From North: Take I-95 South to Exit 10.
