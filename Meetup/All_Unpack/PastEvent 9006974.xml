In &lt;b&gt;Hope and Glory&lt;/b&gt;, it is Bill, a nine year-old living in London, whose life is upturned and intensified by the brutality of the 1940-41 Blitz. As the grownups worry, the adolescents flirt and fall in love, and the children rejoice in the freedom afforded by the disruptions of the bombing. The film is perhaps Boorman’s most classical, linking streamlined storytelling at its most entertaining to the director’s fascination with the anarchic side of human nature that is both troubling and cathartic. HFA Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A superlative memoir of life in London during World War II from the unique perspective of a child, this ravishing drama from writer/director John Boorman is his thinly veiled autobiography and an essential work from his canon, arguably his single most important film. Much has been made of the film's fine performances, and they are indeed unforgettable, with young Sebastian Rice-Edwards suitably wide-eyed and vigorous as the hero, and Sammi Davis and Ian Bannen turning in career-high work as the main character's trampy sister and eccentric grandfather, respectively. What makes &lt;b&gt;Hope and Glory&lt;/b&gt; a truly remarkable picture, however, is Boorman's keenly remembered, written, and re-created sense of a child's perception and how the mechanics of the adult world intrude upon it. Shifts in tone and mood occur rapid-fire at times, moving from such extremes as horror to humor to wonder in the same scene, as the filmmaker recalls the instant fluctuations of temperament and feeling that wash through a boy, particularly one subjected to the sensory overload of the London Blitz. When the film moves in its third act to a genteel country home where safety is found with a protective overseer, the change is jarring, but intentionally so. Presenting war as a joy and a thrill is an audacious act of artistic honesty  All Movie Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Tom  holdiing a Meetup sign near the front row at the end of the film</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224637208000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>John Boorman's Hope and Glory</name><id>9006974</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227470400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9006974/</event_url></item>
