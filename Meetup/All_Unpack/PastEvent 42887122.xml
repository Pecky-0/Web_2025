<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Many of you are already familiar with this place, since we've had many meet-ups here in the past. North Shore Dog is a great place to be when it's snowing or freezing cold outside! It's a very large open area with some agility-type play equipment for the doggies and chairs for the humans. The floor surface is perfect for running and playing, and easy to mop up after "accidents." (Bring bags for poop.) North Shore Dog charges a fee of $5.00 per dog, which will be collected at the front desk as you come in. (There will be no other cost for this meet-up!)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>North Shore Dog (formerly Dogtopia) is located in the rear of Endicott Plaza, behind the Market Basket. When you come in, stop at the desk and tell them you're with the Cavalier group; you will be directed to the room.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karla Rab</member_name><member_id>10717717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1328368508000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322665176000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Run and play in a great indoor setting!</name><id>42887122</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326650400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/42887122/</event_url></item>
