<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Last fall the group said goodbye to summer with a great lunch at the Blue Oar - so let's start this summer off right by returning.  The Blue Oar is located in Haddam, right on the Connecticut River.  Eating is outdoors on brightly painted picnic tables with an island feel, especially when they are playing Bob Marley.  The lunch menu is primarily sandwiches - and the food is great!  The Blue Oar is BYOB - so feel free to bring Bloody Marys, Mimosas, or whatever you crave for a Sunday alfresco lunch/brunch.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch, whoever is up for it, we can take a stroll around Essex.  We have a member who is an old time native of this quaint village and promises to give us the &amp;quot;locals' tour&amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll email everyone before the event to let you know how to identify the group.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326649457000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213993224000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back to the Blue Oar</name><id>8180925</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215963000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/8180925/</event_url></item>
