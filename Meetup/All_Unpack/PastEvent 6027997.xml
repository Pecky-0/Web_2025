A day at Salem Willows, where beach, BBQ, and arcade games await all the loose change that has been piling up on your dresser.  Did anyone say Air Hockey and SkeeBall?  This limitless RSVP is designed to encourage as many of our Beyond Beantown faces to head out and meet your new partners in play.  Check out the website for details on the venue.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.salemweb.com/willows/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.salemweb.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a main course, side dish, dessert, or snack to share, we will provide dogs and burgers and the fixings (with our apologies to the vegetarians out there).  There are also a number of restaurants at the Willows to meet your summertime cravings if your cupboards are bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet, greet, and eat, followed by plans to split up and explore the park and its offerings.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exact site to be announced.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beantown and Beyond</member_name><member_id>4494456</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185909751000</updated><rating><average>4.82000017166</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184529292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beyond Beantown KickOff Event</name><id>6027997</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185638400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/6027997/</event_url></item>
