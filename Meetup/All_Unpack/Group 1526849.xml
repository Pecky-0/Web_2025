&lt;p&gt;Meet other local cyclists while building a good group of friends to socialize with at and away from the trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to have fun and enjoy our passion for cycling and making new friends. Not all is riding here!, some times we put together social meetings @ local restaurants, bars, lounges,etc. another way to meet riders in a non competitive environment. Lets have FUN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 In order to avoid fake members with the purpose of spam we had to make the group private (I bet you don't want any more spam) Just sign in and answer the questions (so we know you are not a robot) and voila! This group was created for the love of cycling and for cycling lovers. Is the last is your real interest welcome and hope to see you soon in one of the rides. If not I ask courteously to leave the group.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Have your REAL profile picture, we as riders must recognize you (for your safety and ours). We are tired of PI's, Spammers &amp;amp; Stalkers.&lt;br&gt;
