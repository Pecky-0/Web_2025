My family is from this region, so I thought it would be fun to share the experience of typical Calabrese eating.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ristorante Marcellino is a &amp;quot;family owned and operated business is known for using &amp;quot;fine ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil, homemade pastas and sauces, and freshly made bread in their wood burning brick oven.&amp;quot;  The restaurant is located in downtown Waltham, and has lots of parking.  There is also transportation on the commuter rail or by bus to reach the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've changed the reservation for a smaller group so that we can order off the menu.
