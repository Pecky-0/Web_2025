<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed how it is easier to meditate in a group, easier and more enjoyable to stay focused and relaxed when you are with a group of like-minded and like-hearted people? Gone are the days of living on mountaintops and deserted lands in order to reach spiritual attainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the time has come to be in community, relating and working on ourselves through the work of relationship. God is inside each person and the goal is to know that God, love that God, and love through that God. Come and awaken to the gift spiritual community can have in your life and how to find the right one for you. You will be glad you did!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Timothy Lin</member_name><member_id>11335175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361502853000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenMeditation</urlname><id>435918</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Meditation &amp; Inner Spirituality Group - New Haven</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1361473249000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spiritual Community: Why It Matters to Our Spiritual Growth</name><id>105720552</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361491200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenMeditation/events/105720552/</event_url></item>
