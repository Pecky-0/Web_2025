&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; For those of us that usually feel self conscious in exercise classes (and/or who aren't always really in-step/graceful/etc....) I loved the fact that she turns the lights down way low and plugs in the colored disco balls.&amp;nbsp; If I wasn't doing the moves exactly what she was no one could really tell!&amp;nbsp; I was moving/exercising so I didn't care if it wasn't perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; The first part of the class is just a "dancing at a club" type of warmup.&amp;nbsp; She plays current music. She does some moves and we copy them and dance together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; THEN you learn a mini routine/dance sequence.&amp;nbsp; We laughed, we messed up, we modifed things, and we ended up with a cute little number in time to a funky song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the fitness classes are  "drop-in" so you don't have to commit to anything - just $10 per class!   Also, you can purchase multi-class deals:  10 classes for $90 or 20  classes for $160.  The cards are good for one year from purchase date.&lt;/p&gt;
