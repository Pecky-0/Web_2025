<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>If anyone is interested in playing Wednesday, let me know.  Conard courts are being used on the 13th so I was hoping to try a new location for weeknights.  Buena Vista courts are on Cornerstone Drive in W.H.  There are no houses on this road but it's right behind Cornerstone Aquatic Center, Veterans Rink and Buena Vista Golf course and near Solomon Schecter school.   I would usually schedule Wolcott Park courts but availability can be difficult, especially if more than 4 players show up.  Buena Vista seem to be less busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My number is 559---7983 if you have questions or comments.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue Nike Hat</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242423673000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242061069000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis - W.H.
