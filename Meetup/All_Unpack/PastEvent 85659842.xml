&lt;p&gt;John Hays Hammond, Jr. built his medieval-style castle between the years 1926 and 1929 to serve both as his home and as a backdrop for his collection of Roman, medieval, and Renaissance artifacts. The castle was constructed as a wedding present for his wife Irene Fenton Hammond to prove how much he cared for her.   In addition, the building housed the Hammond Research Corporation, from which Dr. Hammond produced over 400 patents and the ideas for over 800 inventions.  Second only to Thomas Alva Edison in number of patents, John Hammond was one of America's premier inventors.  His most important work was the development of remote control via radio waves, which earned him the title, "The Father of Remote Control." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they do up the castle for Halloween. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the description on the website there is FREE parking at Stage Fort Park, and a FREE shuttle over to the castle.  The cost for the tour is $15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
