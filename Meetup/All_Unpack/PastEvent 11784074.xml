Wilson, California Institute of Technology, Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nature walk in New England 300 million years ago would have looked quite different from one near Boston today. Instead of forests composed of oaks, maples, and pines, the area would have been dominated by unusual extinct forms: mostly climbing ferns and seed plants under a canopy of trees that more closely resemble telephone poles than anything in a modern garden. How did these plants work?&lt;br /&gt;In this talk, we will explore how recent advances in plant physiology allow paleontologists to understand, in a quantitative fashion, how extinct plants functioned. Are there fundamental physiological differences between extinct plants and living ones? What can we learn about ancient environments and ecosystems from looking at fossil plants?&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I  have light brown hair, and black messenger bag, with black small sketchbook.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachel</member_name><member_id>8085411</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258728402000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257274958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Evolution of Plants at the Boston Public Library</name><id>11784074</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258500600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11784074/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/global_5310283.jpeg</photo_url></item>
