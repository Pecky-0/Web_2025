(Some things are important to do in order, glad this isn’t one of them!)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please have a card with list of ingredients for your potluck item.  We’ve had A LOT of wonderful dishes that naturally lead to many ingredient questions, so the cards will make it easier for sharing/swapping recipes.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re not familiar with Michael Greger, M.D., he is a physician, author, and internationally recognized professional speaker on a number of important public health issues and serves as the Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States. &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Greger is also licensed as a general practitioner specializing in clinical nutrition and was a founding member of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine. &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Greger was featured on the Healthy Living Channel promoting his latest nutrition DVD and honored to teach part of Dr. T.
