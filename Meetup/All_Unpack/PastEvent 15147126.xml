There are maps at the trail head. This would be a great walk for families with kids, as the trails are easy to walk with no rocks, roots or hills. The best part of Chebacco Woods, is that there are lots and lots of mushrooms! It is off of Rt.22 (Essex St ) in Hamilton. Take a right on Chebacco Road from Rt 22 and the main entrance is 2 miles on the right.&amp;quot; The sign says Hamilton woods, but the map lists it as Chebacco Woods as Chebacco Lake is in the immediate area. Parking for several cars at the trail head. The weather is perfect for hunting. No bugs or oppressive heat!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Mushroom Lovers USA sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Richard P.</member_name><member_id>9495023</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288017195000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fungi's &amp; gils</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mushroom-Lovers-USA</urlname><id>1497456</id><group_lat>42.4700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>Mushroom Lovers USA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287418983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chebacco Woods in Hamilton</name><id>15147126</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287928800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mushroom-Lovers-USA/events/15147126/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/a/global_14374906.jpeg</photo_url></item>
