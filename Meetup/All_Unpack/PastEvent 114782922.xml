As usual, we'll start with a little food, beer, and socializing and then get the talks started around 6PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Blake Carlson will be presenting "Rails 4 Live Coding ... Without a Net".  Blake will be creating his first Rails 4 application LIVE and unrehearsed.  Instead of the usual polished Rails tutorial, this live coding demonstration will be done "without a net" (no preprepared code and solutions) so we're sure to run into our share of problems and issues along the way.  This will be your opportunity to observe the workflow, tools, and resources of an experienced Rails developer as he works through the process of crafting a Rails 4 application.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Blake Carlson</member_name><member_id>48043512</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368730306000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Rubyists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>route9rubygroup</urlname><id>389347</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Route 9 Ruby Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366207690000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May 2013 Route 9 Ruby: Rails 4 Live Coding ...
