The visitor center is in Lincoln R.I on I-295 north, north of exit 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blackstone river rail trail runs approximately 11 miles from Lincoln to Woonsocket RI. Its very nice, meandering along woods and streams. We can meet at the Blackstone River Visitor Center on RT 295 in RI. From Boston, take 95S into RI, then 295-S ( at exit 4 ). Go to exit 9 and turn around to be headed back North-the Center is on 295 North bound side. There is a Duncan Donuts, restrooms, and plenty of parking, and the trailhead access is behind the building. Meet in the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
