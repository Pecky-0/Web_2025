 Palmer Cove Yacht Club is having a Nautical Yard Sale. &lt;br /&gt;

 You can set up a table for $5. What a bargain! &lt;br /&gt;

 This is your chance to clean out, have some fun and make a little money! &lt;br /&gt;

 Yard sale is set for Saturday May 19 &lt;br /&gt;

PCYC will advertise a 9AM start &lt;br /&gt;

If you plan on setting up a table, you should arrive around 8 and be ready for "early birds" &lt;br /&gt;

The people setting up the tables are often the biggest buyers. &lt;br /&gt;

The main rush is over by 10 but we advertise 9 to 11. &lt;br /&gt;

Fee is still $5. &lt;br /&gt;

Spread the word to any others that might be interested. The more goodies the better for all. &lt;br /&gt;

The more sellers we have, the better. &lt;br /&gt;

We usually have a great turnout. &lt;br /&gt;

Sell anything from dinghy's and kayaks to fishing tackle and old hardware&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337444851000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332254731000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Palmer Cove Yacht Club is having a Nautical Yard Sale.</name><id>57104282</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337432400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/57104282/</event_url></item>
