The leader (Bob Barnes) of the Wedeln Ski and Snowboard Race Team will hold dryland training every Tuesday night this Fall. The workout is great for anyone who wants to get in shape, you do not have to be a skier or racer.  All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob will lead the group in Plyometric based training methods designed to get the leg muscles and core ready for the season.  This is the same workout that he has used for many years to prepare for ski racing.  There is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info about plyometrics check out&lt;a href="http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/sampleworkouts/a/Plyometrics.htm" target="_blank"&gt;PLYOMETRICS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Bob will be near the gazebo.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252451498000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251242154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ski Fitness Training</name><id>11200243</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251844200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/11200243/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/3/global_10391459.jpeg</photo_url></item>
