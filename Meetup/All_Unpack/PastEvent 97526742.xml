This was a blast last year, and I ran into the marketing director Berniece over summer who said we were the most fun group they ever had, so I took the collective compliment for all of you and am organizing another night. We'll head up to Londonderry, have cheese, crackers and taste many kinds of mead. Except for the one that burned my mouth like fire.  Someone else can drink that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 15 dollars to attend and I'll collect money at the door.  The money covers the tour and tasting, your keepsake glass, $10 dollars off two or more bottles, cheese and crackers. (And yes, I am cutting and pasting that from the email I got from Berniece.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come up to NH for the evening, find a special bottle of mead to share on Valentines Day, and mingle with some very smart, cool folks&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's an event just for us, so just come on in.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alison</member_name><member_id>5775006</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359861526000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357157823000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mead Tasting by Moonlight</name><id>97526742</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359849600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/97526742/</event_url></item>
