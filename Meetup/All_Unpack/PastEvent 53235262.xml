We tried to get a table and were told "no political groups", but we are moving forward none-the-less. It's a 2-day show and I have scheduled a meetup for each day. The show starts at 9am, the plan is to get there early and pamphlet the parked cars with Ron Paul's 2nd Amendment slim jim. This won't take long if we have enough people. I know some of us are planning on paying the $10 entrance fee so we can peruse the show in our Ron Paul gear and it should cover us if parking becomes an issue for some of our meetup members. The worst they can do is tell us to leave. After the am pamphlet drop, we can do a sign wave at a nearby intersection if we have enough supporters (around noon to 2pm) - and then hit the afternoon cars that have cycled in afterwards - the show runs till 5pm Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1 Off coupon for those who wish to peruse the show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also allows for two groups each day, an am and pm. Some will stay most of the day but if you can't make it in the am, you can still come up for the afternoon and participate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always please feel free to call &lt;strong&gt;860-730-3RON&lt;/strong&gt; to get in contact with us the day of and during the meetup if you've arrived but cannot locate us - the Eastern States Fairground is pretty big.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331393438000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329861314000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>West Springfield Gun and Knife Show Saturday</name><id>53235262</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1331388000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/53235262/</event_url></item>
