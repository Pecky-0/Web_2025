Every week you will come back to familiar dance routines that will make you sweat away the calories. The last 25 minutes of class a different routine will be taught each week. Music will vary anywhere from Janet Jackson to Missy Elliot but feel free to bring in any music you would like. This class will build and strengthen lean muscle, increase flexibility, and shed calories. Each class will start with an intense stretching warm up that incorporates some pilates. At the end of the class we will work towards developing a "six pack" with a 10 minute abdominal work out. But, in between it's just dance, dance, dance.......So take some "me" time and sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please register at least 24 hours before class at &lt;a href="http://www.bridgetsdancestudio.com"&gt;www.bridgetsdancestudio.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
