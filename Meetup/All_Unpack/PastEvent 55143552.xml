&lt;p&gt;This may be a long ride for some, but I noticed some Riders from R.I. in this Group. &amp;nbsp; If anyone knows of a Bike Shop, in the Foxboro Area, that would do a Clinic, please let me know and I'll let you Post-It. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free Repair Class - Get aquainted with your bike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've just purchased a new bike or have one you're determined to get more use of, there are a few &amp;nbsp;things you ought to know to maximize your time and pleasure on it. That's where Caster's Bicycle &amp;nbsp;steps &amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know it's a real bummer when you're a few miles away from home and get a flat tire but don't know how to fix it. Come to our free clinic to learn the basics about keeping your bike in tip top shape for miles to come. &amp;nbsp;No need to bring your bike. We have plenty here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what we'll be going over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fixing a flat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Quick brake and gear adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Improving your shift technique and more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended this Clinic, a couple of years ago, and found it to be very informative. &amp;nbsp;I am going back, more as a refresher and to learn something I may have forgotten. &amp;nbsp;Whether you are a Newbie or an &amp;nbsp;Experienced Cyclist, you should get something out of it. &amp;nbsp;Plan to be there for at least 2 Hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: &amp;nbsp;They offer the Clinic, at least once a Month. &amp;nbsp;I want to go before the Weather gets nice &amp;amp; we can Ride at Night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave N.</member_name><member_id>10478672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333909358000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330999016000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Clinic</name><id>55143552</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333576800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/55143552/</event_url></item>
