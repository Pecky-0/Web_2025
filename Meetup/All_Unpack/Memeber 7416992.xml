There's a lot I do alone and it's nice to find people with like interests!!!</bio><hometown>Boston</hometown><topics /><name>Tori</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>7416992</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>Hyde Park</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/7416992</link><visited>1311942797000</visited><lon>-71.13</lon></member>
