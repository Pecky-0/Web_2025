You may have considered help from medications to alleviate you depression or anxiety. You, or someone you know, may have tried and accumulated a medicine chest's worth of antidepressants, or anti-anxiety drugs, but none really helped in any enduring way. Then when the side effects became so unpleasant, you may have tried to stop taking them. Only to experience that the withdrawal symptoms (cramps, dizziness, headaches) were torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well you are not alone. Well, here’s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the drugs can be effective in that they lift depression in up to two thirds of patients. But that benefit is hardly more than what patients get when they, unknowingly and as part of a study, take a dummy pill—a placebo. As more and more scientists who study depression and the drugs that treat it are concluding, that suggests that antidepressants are basically expensive Tic Tacs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is finally out! For most people, the effect does not come from any clinical change in brain chemistry, but from the numbing effects of the drugs.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fear and anxiety are in the way of doing many things in our life and it isn’t a pleasant experience for anyone. Yuliya Cohen has taken the mystery out of this condition and humanized its complexity.
