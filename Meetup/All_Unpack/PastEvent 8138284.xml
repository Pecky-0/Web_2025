This family has descended from Illyrians, who were among the earliest settlers of the Mediterranean region.  Throughout history Illyria, modern-day Albania, has been connected to many great empires, either through occupation or trade.  As a result, Illyrians learned many different ways of cooking.  The Illyrian table was considered by Kings and Sultans to be among the worlds most exotic.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In keeping with this tradition of hospitality, the Muja family has a history of success in the restaurant business.  With four chefs in the family they have owned and operated one of the top rated restaurant businesses in the United States and have earned significant media attention.  Also, the founder of the business is a world traveler who believes passionately that Mediterranean cuisine is the finest on the planet.  His vision is to bring the greatness of these cuisines and cultures together in one place: MAVI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservations will be under "Judy"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judy</member_name><member_id>5096147</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216255190000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213388862000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mavi Mediterranean Fusion Restaurant</name><id>8138284</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215903600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/8138284/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
