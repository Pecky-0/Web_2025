What could be more fun and exciting than getting out and meeting people, all the while in disguise? People are more relaxed and willing to let their guard down while in a wig! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attended this event last year with Meet In Boston and it was an absolute blast! I thought it would be a great event for the Social Fun group to do and a great way to meet new people...And YES, wigs ARE required for this event, so start looking now - there are plenty of options at Iparty and Halloween clearance sales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting up at Clarke's in Faneuil Hall and then on to 2-3 more bars...We'll stop for food so we can keep up our strength will all the drinking (very important to eat!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCHEDULE - &lt;br /&gt;5:00 Clarke's - 21 Merchants Row (Faneuil Hall)&lt;br /&gt;5:45 Ned Devine's - 1 Faneuil Hall Mkt&lt;br /&gt;6:30 FOOD STOP (Faneuil Hall Marketplace Food Court)&lt;br /&gt;7:30 The Black Rose - 160 State St.&lt;br /&gt;8:30 Kitty O'Sheas - 131 State Street &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we'll be moving around quite a bit, I'll have my cell phone on in case anyone comes late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still need help finding a wig, let me know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to it!! &lt;br /&gt;Beth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth </member_name><member_id>2944513</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Catherine </member_name><member_id>6146290</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>31</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258409896000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255718954000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Flip Your Wig" Bar Crawl</name><id>11642906</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258236000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/11642906/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/5/8/global_11248184.jpeg</photo_url></item>
