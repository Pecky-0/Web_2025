<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Since many of us can make Friday mornings, I thought it would be fun to combine the two groups until it makes sense to split up again. We'll try to get in stories and songs in both languages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main branch of the Cambridge Public Library has a wonderful children's area on the top floor. There is ample underground parking ($0.25/15 min by cash or MC/Visa). It's also a quick walk from the Harvard station, and there are a number of bus routes that go by the library. We can also meet in private homes from time to time as we have members willing to host! (Please let Yooree know if you'd like to invite us to your home.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your schedule changes and this is no longer a good time for you to meet, please update your responses in Doodle.
