The movie starts at 4:30 so let's meet by 4:15 in the lobby.  If anyone's interested, I'm hoping to go to dinner and/or drinks afterwards.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Single Man&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George (Colin Firth) is a college professor who recently lost his lover, Jim (Nicholas Hoult), in a car accident. Terribly grief-stricken, George plans to commit suicide. As he goes about his daily routine and puts his affairs in order, his encounters with colleagues, students and an old friend (Julianne Moore) lead him to make a final decision as to whether life is worth living without Jim. &lt;br /&gt;Cast: Colin Firth, Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult, Matthew Goode, Jon Kortajarena &lt;br /&gt;Director: Tom Ford &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://asingleman-movie.com/#/home" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://asingleman-movie.com/#/home" target="_blank"&gt;http://asingleman-mov...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>3461529</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268937698000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266602390000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Single Man - Movie and Dinner</name><id>12648570</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266786900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/12648570/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/global_13194074.jpeg</photo_url></item>
