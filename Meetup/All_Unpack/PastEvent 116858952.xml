 &lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/9/6/event_4002902.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; They say it will be in the 60s &amp;amp; 70s on Tuesday. So please, join Steve Ob1. and friends at anytime for a late afternoon of easy exercise and fun, or just come to watch. Wimp Volleyball is a noncompetitive games. Totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We will be following the rules. But, having fun, getting some exercise, and learning, will be more important than winning. In these games, we work on trying to keep the volley going. Rather than trying to end the volley. We do not count the score. We count the laughs. The winners in these games, are those who sides hurt from laughing to much. We usually have a larger number attending. So, we will rotate everyone through. If we have enough of those people who must play to win, and follow exactly to the rules. We will try to have another net set up for them. So, bring your friends, and your teens, an your drinks to keep cool and hydrated and Bug repellent. Plus, a chair if you want? &lt;br /&gt;

 Also we often go out afterwords ( 8 pm. ) for some food or drink. So, plan to join us for that also. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be asking for a $1.00 donation to help play for the equipment. But please remember, your attends is more important than the your money. We would rather you play than pay. The money is only to help pay for the maintaince and the equipment. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will also have another event going at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wimp Volleyball Chatting &amp;amp; Cheerleading." This event requires a lawn chair and the ability to chat. This event is for those who would like to play. But, know they just don't have the energy. So, they just sit, watch, and chat.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look 4 us on the west side of the road as you drive through the park.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367370421000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1367277521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wimp Volleyball</name><id>116858952</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367359200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/116858952/</event_url></item>
