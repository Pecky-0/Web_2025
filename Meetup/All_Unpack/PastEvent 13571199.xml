His talk will cover Grails and REST-ful web services:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Representational State Transfer (REST) is fast becoming recognized as the preferred web services architecture in many situations. REST provides a loosely coupled way for applications to communicate with each other across the web. The simplicity and expressiveness of REST make it a perfect fit for Grails. Grails provides a full stack framework with which to build RESTful applications, complete with persistence, a transactional service layer, logging, security services, and more. Whether you're building applications for a service oriented architecture or just want to add some integration points to your standard web apps, you can relax and let Grails take care of the REST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the hair salon; we're above it.
