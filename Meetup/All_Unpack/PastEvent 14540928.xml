I am a certified Reiki Master and a certified Chakra Instructor and Healer.  I will also be speaking about how the chakras are connected to certain parts of our being and how past or present trauma in our lives changes these chakras and the way they perform.  There will be plenty of hand outs to refer to during and after the class.  Then I will perform a chakra healing demonstration using crystals and a singing bowl.  Questions will be welcomed.  To find out more information about me you can go to my website at www.intothelight.vpweb.com.
