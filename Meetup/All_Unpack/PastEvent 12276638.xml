Let's do our Sunday afternoon thing! It's cold out there, but refreshing to get out and walk and talk with friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at West Rock, which is a Connecticut State Park located in New Haven and Hamden.  There are various entrances to the park, but we will be parking at Lake Wintergreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN:  West Rock offers various levels of hiking, as it is a very large park.  However, this Meetup will be manageable for any hiker, and will offer a scenic view of the bethany area, and a chance to walk by the lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the Lake Wintergreen entrance, which is located on Main Street, between 12:55 and 1:00, and we'll get rolling onto the trail by five minutes after one. This walk will take less than 2 hours.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING:  A bottle of WATER!, hanky if your nose gets runny in the cold, and a snack if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads;  &lt;b&gt;warm&lt;/b&gt; clothing; warm socks; hat and gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST:  We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website.  Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please use the Google map below (or, your GPS) to find the intersection of Main Street and Valerie Court in Hamden. From there, drive on Main Street, heading downhill.  You will see the parking area at the bottom of the hill, where Main Street bends to the right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is no fee for parking in the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325276" target="_blank"&gt;Park website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tab=wl" target="_blank"&gt;Google Map -- Intersection of Main Street and Valerie Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer (Sarah) will be wearing red</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266077188000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263139956000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Hikers' Sunday Afternoon Walk at West Rock (Lake Wintergreen)</name><id>12276638</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265565600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/12276638/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/b/7/global_7013047.jpeg</photo_url></item>
