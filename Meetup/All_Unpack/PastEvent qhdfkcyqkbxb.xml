I will go over some &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Basic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; information on how trading options is different from trading equities, and will provide a handout on some of the vocabulary associated with options. We will take an abbreviated look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using options, and will likely end the meeting there. Future discussions on the subject will be based upon the thoughts, reactions, and comments of those present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a book they'd care to recommend, or provide a review on for the group, please let me know via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, bringing questions regarding a favorite stock from your own watchlists (or perhaps even a trade from the past) for a group critique is very much encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room). Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a ﻿﻿lively and engaging discussion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile...&lt;/p&gt;
