&lt;p&gt;I anticipate this being a fairly fast paced walk- planning to walk for 60-90 minutes. &amp;nbsp;Primarily packed sand/dirt, with some crushed gravel trails, and a few very short but steep inclines- otherwise very much a&amp;nbsp; level,&amp;nbsp;very easy&amp;nbsp;trail.&amp;nbsp; For safety purposes, this walk will only be held if there is enough firm, committed interest...if not, I'll cancel by early Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing everyone...and friendly, leashed pooches (that you clean up after) are also welcomed!&amp;nbsp; Please note there will be a $1 fee collected from everyone to help Angela defray the cost of the meetup dues. &amp;nbsp;Also, there is a parking fee ($2 at the meter if I recall).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet in the main lot across from the Visitors Center (a white house)...I drive a blue Pacifica with NY plates</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324950114000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1324084725000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday afternoon Maudslay Walk- come explore with me!</name><id>44704322</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324233000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/44704322/</event_url></item>
