After a rough short week step into Whiskey's to meetup with friendly fun folk.  &lt;a href="http://www.panospin.com/projects/whiskeys/hynesfront2soohoo.html" target="_blank"&gt;View Outside of Whiskey's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week Leo suggested Whiskey's and mentioned they have .10c wings. I also noticed they offer $2.50 appetizers until 7. The price is right and it is a smokehouse, so it may be worth it...but its the drinks we care about. Right? Actually for me it is the camaraderie. Anyone wanna camarade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang as long as you want but I will check out around 8....unless???? &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Encourage you to pay as you order or maintain your own tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the back wearing a purple cable knit sweater. Look for the mirrors on which I will place a meetup sign.
I'll buy a drink for the first one to find me however the last person has to buy me one.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><why>Relax and unwind after a very short work week</why><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199202905000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Whiskey's for Their Wings</name><id>7005049</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199401200000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/7005049/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/d/0/global_2896304.jpeg</photo_url></item>
