 Sunset: We'll light a candle at sunset on Friday, December 21. Gather in the Great Room at 4:10 pm for a 4:18 pm sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light from the Darkness: We'll once again do our traditional spiraling-in-and-out ritual, this year in the Great Room. Bring a candle in a jar. We'll plan to fill the candles with our wishes for the coming year as we walk the spiral. Gather in the Common House at 8 pm on 12/21 for this ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social/sing/celebrate: Join us in the Great Room for hanging out, hot cider, and warm food. Singing is not mandatory :) Games have been known to happen. We should be into this part by 8:45 pm or so; all are welcome. If you have dietary restrictions, let us know.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356147883000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Community-Minded People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cohousing</urlname><id>368003</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6299972534</group_lon><name>Sawyer Hill EcoVillage: Mosaic Commons &amp; Camelot Cohousing</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355191465000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Solstice Celebration!</name><id>94890272</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>23400000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356123600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cohousing/events/94890272/</event_url></item>
