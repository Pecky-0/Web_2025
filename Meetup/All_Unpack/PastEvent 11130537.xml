I've emailed them to see if we can use their side room, but if not, we'll just get some tables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're taking the T, Central Square is on the Red Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll probably talk about the books, television, movies, comics and games that we like (and those we don't like, and even those we may be ashamed to admit that we like), but there is no set agenda!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Either ask at the hostess stand or look for the geeks with the Red and White Meetup signs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom "spot" Callaway</member_name><member_id>2590946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253192448000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250526584000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Social Meetup</name><id>11130537</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251846000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/11130537/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
