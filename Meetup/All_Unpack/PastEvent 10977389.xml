The next movie up is Blue Hawaii, starring Elvis Presley.  The movie starts promptly at 7pm (no previews) so please arrive by 6:45.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Hawaii (1961)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chad Gates has just gotten out of the Army, and is happy to be back in Hawaii with his surf-board, his beach buddies, and his girlfriend. His father wants him to go to work at the Great Southern Hawaiian Fruit Company, but Chad is reluctant. So Chad goes to work as a tour guide at his girlfriend's agency. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Elvis Presley, Joan Blackman, Angela Landsbury&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're welcome to bring your own popcorn, snacks and beverages.
