The RSVP on Meetup lets me know to save a seat for you.  It does NOT get you a ticket for the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to attend, &lt;b&gt;FIRST&lt;/b&gt; buy your ticket.  &lt;b&gt;THEN&lt;/b&gt; RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; on Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to attend, but you don't have a ticket yet, RSVP &amp;quot;maybe.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I posted this event on the website, I also sent an email to everyone in the group.  The email has details about how to get advance tickets, as well as more information about the film.  If you'd like me to send it to you again, use the link next to &amp;quot;Who's hosting?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send more details to people who say they are coming.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>A</member_name><member_id>8074607</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267056220000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265672922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jour de fÃªte  </name><id>12555291</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266883200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/12555291/</event_url></item>
