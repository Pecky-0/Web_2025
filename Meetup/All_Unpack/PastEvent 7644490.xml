There will be room for discussion and questions as well as an experiential piece which deepens a persons knowing that God is real.&lt;br /&gt;These classes include basics of the laws of the universe, in depth discussions about what is the soul, light, blessings and prayer. You will love it because it is simple and practical. Yet will also change your life.&lt;br /&gt;I co- teach this class with another priest named Rev Mary Francis so you will get to meet us both.&lt;br /&gt;Please join us.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace to you,&lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will meet you at the door.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208882989000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Because you know you there is something more and there is!</why><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207012310000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meditation and Christian Mysticism</name><id>7644490</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208709900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/7644490/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/1/global_622209.jpeg</photo_url></item>
