We can now take credit cards. Floor plans are nearly finalized. People are signing up. Now that were in our final stages of getting everything figured out we would like to try to have a meeting of sorts with ANYONE that is interested in joining the studio so that we can get a general idea if everyone is happy with the floor plan and other details before we move ahead with actual construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet somewhere in worcester depending on how many people want to come will determine the venue. The date will be next Wednesday the 29th 7pm some where in worcester.&lt;br /&gt;We will go over the proposed floor plan member ship details benefits and how the whole thing will work as a Coop type of studio.&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on attending or want to but cant make it please message me back or call me with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;PCS 508-353-9900&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS be sure to tell anyone you know that might be interested in the studio so they can hopefully come. because im not running this as a profitable business like most area studios it cant work unless we have enough people involved&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick C.
