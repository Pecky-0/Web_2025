Gregorio Uribe's show is the first of a series of four FREE concerts in O'Day Park on four consecutive Thursdays throughout the rest of July. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it out!! We'll be able to kick back in the park so bring your friends, a picnic dinner, a blanket, lawn chairs and, of course, your dancing shoes!! O'Day Park is just a few blocks walking distance from the Copely Square T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregorio Uribe y Su Orquesta combines the line-up used in the older Colombian bands, such as those bands of Lucho Bermúdez and Pacho Galán, with a fresh sound where influences of different styles can be heard. With 15 musicians (3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 4 saxes and the rhythm section) they produce a great dance vibe of energetic rhythms and subtle harmonies.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Powell</member_name><member_id>930768</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215903918000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214931422000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>GREGORIO URIBE O'Day Park (FREE)</name><id>8254642</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215730800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/8254642/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/global_4650117.jpeg</photo_url></item>
