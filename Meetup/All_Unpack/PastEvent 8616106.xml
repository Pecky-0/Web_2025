There is a free Art and Architecture Tour of the building Tuesdays beginning at 6:00 pm.  The tour highlights the architecture of Charles Follen McKim and Philip Johnson, as well as the many works of famed sculptors and painters. The tours last about an hour and are given by volunteer guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please meet near the main front door of the Library (big steps) at approximately 5:45pm.  You can call Bernadette's cell phone at: 617-372-3557.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a short but fun event and it should be very interesting to learn more about our wonderful city and some of it's architecture!  We may have a drink afterwards if girls are up for it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet near main front door of library, or call Bernadette's cell 617-372-3557.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221859092000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219675664000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Boston Public Library "Art &amp; Architecture Tour"</name><id>8616106</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221602400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/8616106/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/6/9/global_5285737.jpeg</photo_url></item>
