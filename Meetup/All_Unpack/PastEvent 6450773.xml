Therefore the reading for this meeting is the last 3rd of the 2nd part and the first two 3rd-s of the 3rd part, and we will finish Of a Christian Common-Wealth at the following meeting. I hope that this is not too confusing. Just a reminder that this is a guideline &amp;quot;only&amp;quot;,  feel free to attend without reading &amp;quot;any Hobbes&amp;quot;, or read about Hobbes and/or about his works. See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are meeting yet again at a new place for us. It is at the same entrance where Bombay Club and Rendang  are, but on the first floor. Again if you do not find us at the Wagamama by 7:15pm, then that means that we are at the Bombay Club because we found that new place difficult to meet at.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192316561000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191071494000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thomas Hobbes: Leviathan III</name><id>6450773</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192143600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/6450773/</event_url></item>
