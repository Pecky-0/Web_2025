<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi gang,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the 6 who showed up last meeting for a good discussion about whether naturalism is falsifiable.  This involved the issue of whether it's even conceivable we could encounter entities that we have good reason to think are supernatural. We'll have to revisit this since it's fundamental in thinking about naturalism, and judging by disagreements, not a straightforward question. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For June 9 (at 7 pm) I thought we might consider the psychological viability of naturalism. What are the emotional impediments to accepting naturalism and how might we overcome them? People often suppose that we must believe ourselves to have a strong, contra-causal free will in order to be lead moral and meaningful lives. Or that without god to back up our moral intuitions, we will literally become demoralized. These responses present formidable obstacles to the spread of a thorough-going naturalism. How can we best reassure people that naturalism isn't the end of the world? What sorts of messages and strategies might work in gaining acceptance for naturalism? Or is human psychology constitutionally unable to assimilate it? A sampling of reassurances can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.naturalism.org/resource.htm#Encounter" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.naturalism...&lt;/a&gt; .  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, hope to see you June 9, 7:00 at Z-Square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;twc  at  naturalism.org  &lt;br /&gt;617-480-8846  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month):   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the round table downstairs in the alcove.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213225932000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210639750000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Is naturalism psychologically viable?</name><id>7925913</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213052400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/7925913/</event_url></item>
