<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I was wondering may be I should try something a little different than picking a movie or a restaurant and force it on everyone as a movie meetup. So I am going to post a recurring meetup occurs every third Friday and request all of you to suggest interested movie names and any fun activities that you would like to do with the rest of the group. You can provide your suggestions as a comment in your RSVP. Fun activities can be dinner, happy hour, drinks, current events, shopping, movie discussions or any other interesting activities suitable for this group at the time. I will choose the most popular suggestions for that specific week and update everyone on the exact plans closer to the actual date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sep-24 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will split into two groups for either of these two shows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (PG-13) &lt;br /&gt;Shia LaBeouf, Javier Bardem &lt;br /&gt;127 minutes &lt;br /&gt;Show Time: 6:40&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Town (R) &lt;br /&gt;Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall &lt;br /&gt;123 minutes &lt;br /&gt;Show Time:6:30 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be there in the theater lobby at 6.20 PM. There is a small coffee area at the corner of the lobby. Last time the group met there. (Opposit to the box office). Since its opening day for Wall Street, I would suggest to get your ticket either in advance or reach the theatre as early as possible and get it before the show starts. Please update your RSVP if you can not make it. We will wait till 6.35 and go inside the theater afterwards. So please do come on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Here is some additional information and related websites: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the show times for this theatre:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bowtiecinemas.com/blue-back.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bowtiecine...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To know more about Blue Black Square and points of interest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bluebacksquare.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bluebacksq...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For parking options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bluebacksquare.com/parking/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bluebacksq...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bluebacksquare.com/directions/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bluebacksq...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On going Events&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bluebacksquare.com/events/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bluebacksq...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be there in the theater lobby at 6.20 PM.
