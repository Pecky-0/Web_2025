Each year, close to 30,000 people from across New England visit downtown Nashua to enjoy this FREE holiday event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening kicks off with a candlelit walk of thousands down to Railroad Square where the City's official Christmas tree is lit.  Much of the downtown is closed to traffic for the evening, allowing Strollers to wander to different artistic and cultural performances, sample offerings from street vendors, dine in downtown’s fine restaurants and do holiday shopping at our unique specialty shops and boutiques. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entertainment - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 25 venues will host a variety of performers this year in addition to the costumed characters and entertainers on the street.  Program guide to be posted on website by November 6th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New this year!
