We will confirm the headcount the week before, and make reservations for our group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you not familiar with the South End, it's a great neighborhood to walk around. They also have an open market on Harrison Ave on Sundays- maybe we can walk over afterwards. We have never been to Stella but have heard great things about it. Check out their website here: www.bostonstella.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For transportation, I'd suggest the Orange line to Back Bay- it's about a 10 minute walk. Parking can be tough in the South End, particularly on Sunday mid-mornings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will make reservations under Keuning.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247452809000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>This is a great way to meet new people in a relaxing environment, and enjoy great food!</why><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210209854000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Brunch at Stella</name><id>7895548</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214148600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/7895548/</event_url></item>
