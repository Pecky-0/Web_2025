This will be a strenuous and challenging hike...but very rewarding. We will meet at the Webster-Jackson Trail Head at 10:15 and start hiking by 10:30. We will take the Webster-Jackson Trail's Jackson branch up to the summit of Mt Jackson. There we find the Appalachian Trail's Webster Cliff Trail that will take us by the AMC Mizpah Spring Hut and up to the summit of Mt Pierce, and then the Crawford Trail back to beginning. The two trail heads are close enough together that no carspotting is needed. Total hike is 8.3 miles with an elevation gain of 2,650 feet. The trail between the AMC hut and Mt Pierce is supposed to be especially steep and challenging. LOCATION: The trail head is located on rt 302 just south of the AMC Highland Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking groups are limited to 10 people in the White Mountains....but we have more than 10 interested so I'll open it to 20 and we can divide into two groups at the trail head. Let me just remind people that although this hike has a 2659 ft elevation gain....to put it in context, Monadnock is an 1800 ft elevation gain, so its significantly higher and longer! Keep that in mind when signing up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND TRIP:&lt;br /&gt;We have events in the White Mountains on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. An easy hike on Saturday at Frankenstein Cliffs and Arethusa Falls, a challenging one on Sunday as we summit Mts Pierce and Jackson, and a fun day zip lining on Monday. Feel free to join us for any of the events or all three. There are plenty of places to stay nearby. I rented a cabin for myself for 65 dollars a night here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abetterlifenh.com/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abetterlifenh.com/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.abetterlif...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also a couple of campgrounds nearby that are about 30 bucks a night (assuming 2 adults per campground, 10 bucks for additional adults up to 4 total)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beechhill.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beechhill.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.beechhill....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crawfordnotchcamping.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crawfordnotchcamping.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.crawfordno...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the AMC highland center is nearby, I think its 90 bucks a night:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/whitemountains/highland/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.outdoors.org/lodging/whitemountains/highland/index.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.outdoors.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These locations are all near the two hikes, the zip lining is in Lincoln, about 40 minutes from area where the hikes are.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the bright yellow escape or call my cell 508 414 8544.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275533975000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272508937000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Memorial Day Weekend Trip: Mt Pierce and Mt Jackson</name><id>13326033</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275228900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/13326033/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/a/global_14701770.jpeg</photo_url></item>
