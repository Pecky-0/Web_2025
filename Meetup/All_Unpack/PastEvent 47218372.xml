Yet the ways of healing by Divine Spirit are truly endless. And many time, an individual who has received relief does not connect it back to Spirit, but feels he has stumbled upon help by chance.&amp;quot; Sri Harold Klemp, &amp;quot;Spiritual Wisdom on Health and Healing&amp;quot; The Discussion will be initiated by the interests and questions of those participating. A universal Spiritual Exercise will be shared that will provide the opportunity for direct insight regarding any questions or challenges the individual might be exploring. People of all faiths are invited to attend. Sharing our stories and insights may open doors to new Spiritual Realizations and Practices as we aspire to live a more healthy Spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical life.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Elberty</member_name><member_id>6968750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327850464000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Spiritual People Seeking Truth</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sing-hu-the-love-of-the-light-and-sound-of-god-in-Vermont</urlname><id>1121796</id><group_lat>43.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Everyday Spirituality, Vermont Spiritual Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326051677000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Introductory Discussion - Spiritual Wisdom on Health and Healing</name><id>47218372</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327766400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sing-hu-the-love-of-the-light-and-sound-of-god-in-Vermont/events/47218372/</event_url></item>
