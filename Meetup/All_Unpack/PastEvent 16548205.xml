&lt;p&gt;The Early Ford V8 Club guys we do the Wings and Wheels show with are holding their 41st annual car show at the airport on April 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like previous years, they have offered to give us space for free to setup a table with our literature and park an airplane or two to show. It is a little less than two months before the June YE event and we usually get a lot of people pick up YE forms. Last year I brought my airplane out for people to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car guys bring in thousands of people and it is a good opportunity to talk to the public and show them that airports, pilots, and airplanes are not their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great if I could get 4 or 5 people to hang around the table and help answer questions with me. I am also looking for a 1 or 2 airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303042993000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297610140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fitchburg Airport Car Show</name><id>16548205</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303038000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/16548205/</event_url></item>
