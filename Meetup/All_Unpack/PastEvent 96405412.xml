&lt;p&gt;This will be the second of what I'll be calling  &lt;span&gt;"new release night at Dan's", where ideally I will schedule the Meetup for the actual home video release date, or as close to that as possible dependent on when I am free.  While I may not have the roomiest place, I do have a very nice 60" plasma HDTV with a very good 5.1 surround sound system.  It is my hope that this will be your next best option to seeing a movie at your local megaplex, or close to it anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Millbury - just off routes 146, 90, and 20 - and will disclose the address and my contact info in a private email to the members who sign up. Please plan on arriving about 7:00 to get settled and chat a bit, and the movie starts at 7:30 sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel free to bring munchies and/or adult beverages for yourself and/or others, but please do not feel obligated to do so.  The assumption should be that people will have eaten a proper meal before they come over, and if that's not the case then by all means bring whatever.  I will make it a point to always make fresh popcorn for these movie nights but otherwise I expect nothing in return besides a good time had by all.  I'll have unlimited Brita-filtered water, yay!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a reminder I do have a cat. He will be locked away in the bedroom but just wanted to give you fair warning in case you're allergic.  I also have a private patio which smokers can feel free to use for a smoke break if they wish.  Just don't expect me to pause the movie while you do that ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all 6 slots are taken up, I recommend jumping on the waiting list and marking your calendars as if you're going, since we all know plans change for people and folks may back out last minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick word the RSVP process: If you reply with a "yes", and at any time after that you realize you will not be coming, PLEASE change your RSVP to "no" as soon as possible.  If there are people on the waiting list, once you switch to a "no" it automatically triggers an email alert to the next person in line letting them know the spot is now theirs.  If you don't remember to change your RSVP (even if you tell me privately that you can't come), there is no way for that next person on the waiting list to find out that they can now attend.  I know things can get busy and people make mistakes, but since the attendance capacity for my meetups is so small please try to make the effort to keep track of your "yes" events.  It would be a shame if someone who wanted to attend could have.  Thanks very much for your understanding and cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan</member_name><member_id>41397892</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357905644000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356360947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Release movie night at Dan's: Frankenweenie</name><id>96405412</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>9000000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357862400000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/96405412/</event_url></item>
