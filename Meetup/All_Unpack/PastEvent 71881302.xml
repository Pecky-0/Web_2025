<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a loop hike including the following--please note that several of the peaks listed below are not directly on the trails but require short side trips that are not listed in this summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Mt Langdon Trailhead to spur to Cave Mountain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-after summiting Cave Mountain, return to Mt Langdon trail and continue hiking to Mt Parker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-continue on Mt Langdon Trail and hike to Mt Resolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-merge onto Davis Path and continue to Stairs Mountain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-turn around and hike Davis Path in southern direction to reach Mt Crawford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-take Davis Path  to Rte. 302&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;The above description is approx. &lt;strong&gt;12-14mi&lt;/strong&gt; hiking distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;-road walk/jog back to Mt Langdon Trailhead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;the walk/jog back to the car is approx. &lt;strong&gt;6-7mi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;This would bring us to a &lt;strong&gt;total of approx. 18-21mi&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the hike is considered ADVANCED, due to the pace and distance.  While we are not hiking any 4000footers, the elevation gain is nonetheless also significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not visited any of these trails before and have done my research online, using numerous trail report sites.  All participants are expected to know the route and be self-sufficient, using map and compass to also follow the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike will start at 8am.  &lt;strong&gt;Please be at the trailhead earlier to be ready at 8am&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group.&lt;/strong&gt; Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. This trip isn't for you if you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us, if you want to head off on your own, or if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guests are not permitted&lt;/strong&gt; - all participants must be members of the Random Group of Hikers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dogs are NOT permitted&lt;/strong&gt; on this hike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a moderate pace trip--of course, our pace will be influenced by the weather, trail conditions etc.  Hikers should be able to hike at a steady pace of 2mph for the entire hike, and then looking forward to a jog back to the car.  If some do not want to jog back to the car, we could split the group with only some of us jogging back to the trailhead to pick up the cars and then picking up the rest of the hikers at Davis Path Trailhead.  &lt;strong&gt;Please indicate in your RSVP whether you plan on jogging&lt;/strong&gt; (this may of course change, but we want to get a sense of the group beforehand--those who want to jog may put a separate camelbag pack in their backpacks to carry that on the jog while leaving the hiking backpack at the Davis Path Trailhead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we could alter our plans because of fatigue, weather, and/or other conditions and there is no guarantee that we will complete the entire event as described here (i.e. we might not reach the summits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothing, Gear, Equipment, and Supplies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hiking safely is about being prepared so that you can respond to an emergency situation or spend a night in the woods if you have to. Failure to bring the basics puts you and the rest of the group at risk. If you don't know what to wear and/or bring with you or have any questions either refer to the list below or contact me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or on the trail. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don't have what you need you will not be allowed to participate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt Langdon Trailhead is located in Bartlett, NH:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the Mount Langdon Trail trailhead, take Route 302 west from North Conway. In downtown Barlett, take a right at the blinking light (Bear Notch Road is on the left). After crossing the river, the Mount Langdon Trail trailhead and small parking lot are located diagonally to the left.&lt;/p&gt;
