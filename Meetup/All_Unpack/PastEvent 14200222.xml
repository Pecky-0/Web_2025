<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;This time we'll hike the Skyline Trail marked by blue rectangles.  The popular Skyline trail provides fantastic views and has many up and down hills over at least 3 miles.  See attached for the hike plan highlighted in yellow.  The hike will take a FULL 2-2-1/2 hours, depending on the pace.  This event is for MODERATE/ADVANCED hikers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Exit 5 (28 North) off Rt. 93.  Drive 1.7 miles on 28 North and then take a RIGHT onto Chickatawbut Road.  We will meet at the small parking lot IMMEDIATELY on the right after you turn onto Chickatawbut Road.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is not a loop trail so we will need volunteers to drive us to the start of the hike at Shea Rink and then other volunteers to drive some back to their cars at Chickatawbut Road parking after the hike (5 minute drive).**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough water (very important) and wear sturdy sneakers/hiking boots.  Also, consider bringing a snack, sunscreen, bug spray, sunglasses and a hat.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer O</member_name><member_id>8579834</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282174762000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279992402000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday morning hike in the Blue Hills - eastern Skyline Trail</name><id>14200222</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280579400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/14200222/</event_url></item>
