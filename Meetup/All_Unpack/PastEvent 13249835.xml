Come on out and join us Saturday for some fun, laid back, frisbee.  We’ll be on the Boston Common at the softball fields. No dudes allowed. Not even if you wear a skirt and a wig, Joe, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a trial run event to see how much interest there is in a women’s game—if y’all come out and represent, it might become a regular thing! Invite your friends, too!&lt;br /&gt;Also, we will have a special guest: Peri Kurshan, the president of the UPA (Ultimate Players Association); it will be super awesome to have her with us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the game plan:&lt;br /&gt;11:00 - Toss the disc around, meet folks, be merry&lt;br /&gt;11:15 - Overview of the rules, safety, etc - then divide into teams&lt;br /&gt;11:30- Play!!!!!! &lt;br /&gt;1:00 - Conclude the meetup with food and socializing&lt;br /&gt;Here's what we humbly ask of you (works great as a checklist):&lt;br /&gt;Arrive on time to be guaranteed a spot in a game (RSVP is optional - but helpful for us)&lt;br /&gt;Bring LOTS OF WATER!&lt;br /&gt;FYI, cleats are not allowed on the Boston Common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, we will supply the frisbees, cones, first aid supplies (hopefully will never be used) and our pretty smiles. As we periodically mention, all these supplies are paid out-of-pocket by your loving Frisbee organizers and everyone has been so generous with their donations to-date. Thank you and let's keep the dream alive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan and Cara&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>"See the About &gt; Boston Common page for map and directions"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>461418</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cara</member_name><member_id>7321267</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272899873000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271874613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Women Only: Saturday Daytime Ultimate @ Boston Common</name><id>13249835</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272726000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/13249835/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/b/2/global_14542274.jpeg</photo_url></item>
