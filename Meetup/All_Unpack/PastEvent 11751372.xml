We will be outside of Geissler's Supermarket from 10a-2p trying to collect as many thanksgiving basket supplies as possible. I think our record is 102 baskets. Can we beat that? I think we can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say dress warmly!! hat, scarf, gloves, warm socks, all necessary! Or you'll be doing jumping jacks to warm up. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is 4 hours, but if we are close to our goal, we tend to stay a bit to meet it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a bigger vehicle, I would encourage you to come later in the event as you will be loaded and will help bring bags to Human Services. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you rsvp, please let me know if you would prefer morning or afternoon. There are enough of us to split the event into shifts so noone is out in the cold all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volunteers needed to help set up starting at 9:30a.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heidi</member_name><member_id>9534183</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258470832000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256933119000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thanksgiving Baskets</name><id>11751372</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258297200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/11751372/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/0/global_7432208.jpeg</photo_url></item>
