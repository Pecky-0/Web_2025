Want to know how the nuts and berries crowd views the rest of the world?  What drives the bottom line?  Is it the food scare with contaminated products arriving from China?  Mad cow disease?  The diabetes epidemic?  Is this industry growing because people just want to feel better and live longer?  Debra will review several companies from supply side to retail within the industry.  She will also bring some samples of products in the industry to taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIO: DEBRA STARK is the owner of Debra's Natural Gourmet, a natural product store in West Concord, Massachusetts.
