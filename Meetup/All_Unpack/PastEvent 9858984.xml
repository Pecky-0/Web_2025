Scotland, the last bastion of post-war male supremacy is under attack by a nefarious villain – a female American efficiency expert! (Cummings). It takes an unlikely hero – a grey-haired, teetotaling bachelor (Sellers) – to match her. This rarely seen British comedy by the director of The Lavender Hill Mob is a real treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we'll go somewhere for a bite and a talk (perhaps biting talk).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After I'll be at the front of the theater on the right</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236002557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Selling Democracy: Films Of The Marshall Plan:  The Battle of the Sexes</name><id>9858984</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237141800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9858984/</event_url></item>
