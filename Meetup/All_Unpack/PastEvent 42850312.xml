Please be at Martocchio Music in Simsbury 6pm on Dec. 10th. We will phone bank until the system shuts us off at 8:55pm and then settle in for the important Iowa debate at 9pm on ABC. If you have a laptop and cell phone to spare for the evening please bring it in case it's needed. I have ordered headsets and we should have 6 phone banking stations up and running if all goes as planned. They will be set up with inexpensive voip-based numbers so we can save our cell phone minutes. Thanks go to Sara for graciously letting us use the store - please call 860-730-3RON if you have any trouble finding it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323735215000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322625866000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Phone Banking and Iowa Debate Watching Party</name><id>42850312</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323558000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/42850312/</event_url></item>
