&lt;p&gt;If you want to join us for training or if you want to meet us for some company to walk the track or jog at your own pace, the more the merrier!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting April 25th with week 1 of the training for 2011's first C25K session and will be at the track at 6:30pm every Monday and Wednesday night at least into the fall, depending on the weather.&amp;nbsp; (We will start a second session with week 1 again in July but feel free to join in at any point.)&amp;nbsp; Once and a while people may choose to meetup on Friday's after work or early Saturday mornings to get in the 3rd session each week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have a stop watch for the first few weeks when the training is by time.&amp;nbsp; Then we will move to distance using the 1/4 mile track with each person at their own pace.&amp;nbsp; Please see the full schedule&amp;nbsp;on link to coolrunning.com for the full training schedule.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
