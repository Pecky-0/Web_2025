<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Although we're not sommeliers, we do enjoy a good bottle of wine! And thus is the inspiration for this MeetUp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who comes should bring a bottle of their favorite wine (or two!). We're planning on serving hot hors d'oeuvres, not a large sit down meal. Although we're planning on providing the food, if you have a particular pairing that goes well with the wine you're bringing, feel free to bring the food as well! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're going to RSVP, please also answer the questions, especially what wine you'll be bringing as well as the food allergies. FYI for those allergic - we have no pets, but a tenant on the 3rd floor has a Beagle. We don't think it would present a problem as he's never in our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Address will be provided to those that RSVP prior to the meetup date.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call the number listed on the meetup.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1257897946000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255446558000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wine Tasting Potluck</name><id>11616470</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257724800000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/11616470/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
