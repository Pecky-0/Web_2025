Elm Park is famous for its historic bridges reconstructed in 1985.  Facilities include a playground, tennis courts, basketball, and winter skating.  There are numerous picnic areas and hiking trails. And they are installing the 2nd Annual Art In the Park exhibit a week before this Click and Shoot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we think having a picnic, gathering around and taking photos together will be super fun. So pack a picnic basket, a brown bag lunch or even just a snack or two and join us for an outdoor park adventure. We'll meetup around the the red bridge pictured here at 11Am and scope out a nice spot to laydown or blankets or set up our lawn chairs and hang out together for food, then off to take some photos of the park, the art and the folks around us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249744269000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238171337000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Click and Shoot - Picnic Lunch and Art in the Park Sculpture </name><id>10049712</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249138800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/10049712/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/2/global_7854994.jpeg</photo_url></item>
