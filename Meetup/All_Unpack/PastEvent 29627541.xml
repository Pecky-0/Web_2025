A great game based on an adventuring party hanging around an inn after a long day of monster slaying. Use cards to drink, gamble and rough-house with each other. Last one standing wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an easy game to pick up and we'll have a few demo rounds to make sure everyone is in the swing of it. Registration starts at noon and hopefully the event will begin around 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grand prize for the night is a Bag of Gold! We have a leather coin-purse filled with $100 in gold US dollar coins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell your friends and stop on by for a great day and a cool prize.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1314465624000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1313452532000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Red Dragon Inn -Win a Bag of Gold Event!</name><id>29627541</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1314460800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/29627541/</event_url></item>
