<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Based on the poll results, we will meet every other Monday at 7:00 pm. The next meeting will be September 11, at the North End Cafe Paradiso. (not to be confused with the Cafe Paradiso in Cambridge). Cafe Paradiso is on Hanover Street, a block away from Cafe Vittoria (where we met the first two weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manager of Cafe Paradiso is back from vacation and agreed to let us use the downstairs room (subject to its rental by an adjacent restaurant for groups). They have the best gelato on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last meeting was lots of fun, with a broad group of people with varied knowledge of Italian. Thanks to Vincent for keeping the conversation flowing. For the next meeting, what if we did &amp;quot;a little homework&amp;quot; and planned to talk about where we grew up, how many siblings we have, if we're married, have children, our jobs, traveling, etc. ALL THIS IN ITALIAN. Then, if we want to ask questions regarding what we're saying, all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Si Vediamo and remember to RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Warren Agin&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Warren Agin</member_name><member_id>299944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1158188809000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members of this group</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>italian-374</urlname><id>288923</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Italian Language Meetup Group &amp; Luned√¨ Italiano</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156809891000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Italian Language September 11 Meetup</name><id>5101940</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1158015600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-374/events/5101940/</event_url></item>
