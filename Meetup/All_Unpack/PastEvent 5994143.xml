Cowan of Virginia at Greeley Park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unabashedly sentimental comedy, a cat named Samantha (Artistic Director Suzanne Delle) has just started living with a guy named Shuman (Eric Skoglund of Manchester, NH) who she believes is her true love; however, things become problematic when one night Oscar (Bradley Brinkley of South Carolina), a sexy alley cat shows up at the sliding glass door. Suddenly Samantha begins to wonder whether she's an indoor cat or an outdoor cat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also featuring Maria Barry of Nashua, 'Indoor/Outdoor' is an allegory about the difficulties and joys of all manner of relationships. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponsored by the Cat Doctor of Nashua, the Ella F. Anderson Trust, the Arthur Getz Trust, and the City of Nashua. Indoor/Outdoor is part of Nashua's Summer Fun Activities and the August 11th Gate City Cyclone event&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play starts at 7:30 PM, but we need to be there by 6:30 to get good seats.  You need to bring a lawn chair, bug spray and snacks as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for Robert.  I will have a silver foil balloon.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186439772000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183948530000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Play: Indoor/Outdoor</name><id>5994143</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186266600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/5994143/</event_url></item>
