We are trying that out this month with a pre-meeting devoted to options.  This meeting will be part organizational and part content.  If you are interested in seeing options and option strategies become a permanent part of our overall program, please come and lend your ears and your voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Market Update led by Basil Chapman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harlan can't make it this month, but never fear, we have Basil to help us make sense of the market.  He will be examining the market's health in the context of his Chapman Wave methodology.  Don't miss it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Professional's Corner by Fred Sears.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred is a long time professional trader.
