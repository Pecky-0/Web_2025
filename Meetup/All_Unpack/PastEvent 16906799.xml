<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hope to see as many of you as possible on Tuesday, March 15th at 7 PM.&amp;nbsp; Now that the planes are flying to New England from Phoenix and most of the snow has melted in Reading perhaps it will be easier for us to meet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come with your concerns and questions, helpful information and positive attitudes!&amp;nbsp; I will bring my laser for those of you who want to experience it.&amp;nbsp; I had a list of five people last month who wanted to try it but I had to cancel my meeting due to the weather.&amp;nbsp; If we don't have time that evening you can schedule a free mini-session with me during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget donations are always welcome to cover the meeting costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
