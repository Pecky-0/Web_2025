This is a locals place that I found by accident while on a random trip to NH. I wanted to go and figured that some of you heathens may want to hit the slopes. Have no fear if you have no gear (read below). I will be driving up and will have room for 3 people in my car, if there is enough interest I will rent a van.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POP...Under the Lights....
