Well, if you have to ask... not only is it one of the biggest and best cult movies of our time, but more importantly, this Coen Brothers classic is an outrageously insane comedy of bowling, confused identities, naked performance art, porn-obsessed nihilists, a sex offender named Jesus, and some unforgettable musical dream sequences -- Oh, and some guy called &amp;quot;The Dude.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, just bringing this lovably oddball slacker classic back to the BIG screen is cool enough on its own. But that's not all! We're throwing our sixth annual pre-show bowling party extravaganza celebrating the greatness of his dudeness and his laid back misadventures. Here's your chance to compete for sweet Lebowski-themed prizes in tests of wit and skill including, but not limited to: best costume (break out those bowling shirts, bathrobes, and skintight purple Jesus lounge suits!), most convincing nihilist quip, most impassioned Walter rant, and of course, bowling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;We would like to thank Kings Bowling in Back Bay for their generous gift of FREE bowling passes for everyone who attends this event!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please buy your ticket before you RSVP: &lt;a href="http://Tickets" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/node/2686" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolidge.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/u&gt; was completely sold out.  &lt;u&gt;NT Live&lt;/u&gt; was completely sold out.  The Big Lebowski is a cult classic and WILL SELL OUT well in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, please buy your ticket before you RSVP:  &lt;a href="http://The Dude Abides" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/node/2686" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolidge.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will gather before the film across the street at Panera Bread starting at 6:00 to have a light bite, chill out, smoke a doobie, and talk about our bowling prowess.  We get free bowling passes, so I see discussion of this film conducted at &lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Kings&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't forget to buy your ticket in advance:  &lt;a href="http://The Big Lebowski Tickets" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/node/2686" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolidge.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dude.
