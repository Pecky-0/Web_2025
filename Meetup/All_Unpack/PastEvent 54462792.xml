&lt;p&gt;SoJust hosts events that draw progressives of all stripes that share common values but may work on different issues. We host monthly socials that allow for the possibility of cross-issue connections and run a monthly Skillshare Series, hosted by The NonProfit Center*, which increases our individual capacity for movement building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHEDULE&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 6:00-6:30 Socializing -&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;bring your own dinner&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 6:30-8:30 Training and Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public&amp;nbsp;Speaking&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introductory public speaking training focuses on building the basic technical skills necessary to clearly transmit information from the speaker to an audience.&amp;nbsp;Specific skills include word choice, eye contact, volume, vocalized pauses, and body language.&amp;nbsp; Using a small-group format for practical training followed by a discussion debrief from each exercise, the training is designed to allow all participants the opportunity to practice their speaking in an environment that is supportive, attentive, and can provide useful feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 2000 members and 5 1/2 years of creating a diverse cross-issue community in Boston (115+ events!), Socializing for Justice is the best place to find the great people, organizations and community you're looking for while putting the SOCIAL back in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
