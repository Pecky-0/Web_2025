Most of the hike you follow a ridge line so you are able to look into the Connecticut River Valley, overlooking farms and small towns. Many times I have seen gliders or hawks take advantage of the natural thermals. Mt Tom is also a &amp;quot;lost ski area&amp;quot; so I it loosely follows our summer theme of hiking ski area mountains. We will meet inside the main entrance at the parking lot for lake Bray. total distance will be about 6 miles and will be at a moderate pace. Although this hike is in Western MA it is easy to get to, simple trip down Mass Pike (rt 90). For full directions check out: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/mtom.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt; Total time from Boston is just about 2 hours and 15min. Please bring water, snack, decent hiking shoes. weather (as of today) looks great on sunday, sunny and not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316362660000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316036173000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Mt Tom</name><id>33585362</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316358000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/33585362/</event_url></item>
