&lt;p&gt;Ragged Mt. is a trap rock peak on the New Britain/Berlin line. We are going to do a 6.0 mile loop on the Preserve Trail. This trail includes sections of the Metacomet and beautiful views. I like Ragged for its climb at the beginning and great views. The trail is not technical but does require effort to complete.&amp;nbsp;We will head out in a clockwise direction up the cliffs first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to bring water and snacks. The weather is calling for a high of&amp;nbsp;43 so you need gloves, hat, warm socks, hiking boots, and non cotton layers.&amp;nbsp; I alway recomend a dry change of clothes for the ride home. We should be out there no more than 4 hours. The trail conditions should be dry and rocky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a hiking GROUP. That means we start together and stay together. If this doesn't suit you then please don't respond. Do not plan on an exact finish time as we are only as fast as our slowest hiker (which could&amp;nbsp;be me &lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/1723755200050492932723/img/smileys/biggrin.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;). I would not attend if this is your first time out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always with me, NO DOGS-NO CHILDREN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are parking on West Lane in Berlin. Its a small area so squish and be creative.&amp;nbsp; I do not know if the plaza before West Lane has a good place to stop to eat afterward.&amp;nbsp; If you have a suggestion for an after hike stop, post it on your rsvp.&lt;/p&gt;
