Thank you to all who attended our last Meetup! It was another great success.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Our March meetup will continue to meet at Doggie Day at 1PM. Should anyone have any questions please contact me or post on our message boards.  Again, I can not stress enough the importance of the RSVP...since we are indoors right now, we must keep a limit on the number of guests....to prevent overcrowding and provide the safest happiest environment for our pets and their parents. Thank you.... &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:     &lt;br /&gt;There is some free parking located behind Doggieday Playcenter (Tremont Street)  and the CVS, for non-residents of the area there are also plenty of metered spots near DoggieDay located on Tremont street as well as &amp;quot;South End visitor parking spots&amp;quot; located on each end of the street in the South end . Although those may be harder to come by.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay well....ST     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;DOGGIE DAY PLAYCENTER ( 400 Tremont Street, South end, Boston,02116 ...our usual location 1:00PM ONLY!       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.doggieday.com/playcenter.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.doggieday....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2067938</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205335029000</updated><rating><average>4.36000013351</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Chihuahua Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>chihuahua-99</urlname><id>32412</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Chihuahua Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>42</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202670698000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chihuahua March Meeting</name><id>7303940</id><headcount>41</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205082000000</time><rsvp_limit>42</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chihuahua-99/events/7303940/</event_url></item>
