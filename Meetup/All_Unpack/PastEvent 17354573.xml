&lt;p&gt;This one will start at Park Street and walk two miles through the Common, Public Gardens, and Beacon Hill.&amp;nbsp; Here's the &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/bosbeaconloop"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set this meetup for 6:30pm, but will hang around a bit for those of you trying to find parking or relying on the T to get there.&amp;nbsp; Please call or text if you are going to be late.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer a different weekday or start time, let me know.&amp;nbsp; I picked Wednesday because it's the middle of the week.&amp;nbsp; I can do these on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.&amp;nbsp; And could probably start them anytime after 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See my profile picture.
