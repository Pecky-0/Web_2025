&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, October 23rd, Gopi Kallayil, a Chief Evangelist for Google Social for brands will be presenting ways businesses can use Google+ to have meaningful discussions with customers, making them a part of their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement builds long term visibility and brand awareness. We're all aware that brands don't want to bombard consumers with ads and that the ultimate goal is to cut through the noise and connect with customers on an emotional level. With the advent of online and social, brands are now looking to their customers, their stories and experiences, to inform their advertising. From heartfelt TV commercials to comical YouTube shorts to engaging digital experiences, advertisers are finding new ways to include their customers in how they tell their brand stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come learn how Google+ allows brands to have meaningful discussions with customers, making them a part of their story. Join us at 4:30PM for networking with beer, wine, and light food provided by Google followed by a presentation from Gopi Kallayil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no charge to attend this event.&lt;/p&gt;
