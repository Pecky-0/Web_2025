This Friday, however, one of the regulars is not going to be able to make it, so I am issuing an open invite for anyone who would like to just have some fun tossing tile to the table! If you wish to show up, remember that Meeples are a must with occasional dice rolling involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start at 5:00pm and can go till whenever! No set time limit, and there is no set game type we will play, though I would like to get a good game of Rex in if we can muster 6 people. Perhaps 7 Wonders as well. If not, then Fresco is on the list (4p) along with Macao (4p), Castles of Burgundy (4p), and some two players games as well! Bring what you wish and we will be sure to have a good time!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341081273000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340024378000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another Friday Night of Meat and Meeples</name><id>69642832</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341003600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/69642832/</event_url></item>
