About 26 of us went from the two groups and as soon as I heard they where coming back I promised Barry (the harmonica player in the band) that I would love to check them out again.&lt;br /&gt;There's a small cover charge to get into Fat Boy Bill's usually $5.&lt;br /&gt;The ShadowBox Blues Band is a a six-piece, female fronted group that plays a wide variety of up tempo foot stompin blues tunes designed to get folks out of their chairs and onto the dance floor. Sure to get your feet movin and fannies waggin!! Their sets often include blues, r&amp;amp;b, swing and folk, featuring both covers &amp;amp; original tunes. So have a listen on MySpace, and I think you will agree this should be a good start to the year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/gracieblues" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always there is no maybe option for the rsvp so if you're not sure you can go wait till the day of the show and rsvp then BUT SPACE IS LIMITED!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Mark's Meetup Group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>3673693</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239320107000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238408891000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Shadowbox Blues at Fat Boy Bill's in Milford</name><id>10068323</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238891400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/10068323/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/9/f/global_7905231.jpeg</photo_url></item>
