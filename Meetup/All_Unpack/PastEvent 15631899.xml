If we all bring a little something, I will read &amp;quot;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Twas the Night Before Christmas&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; and you can have some music instruments as &amp;quot;props&amp;quot; to make sound effects!  Sound good?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CHARITY -- Adopt-a-Family (United Way)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You are in NO WAY obligated to contribute to this if you come to the meetup, so don't let that stop you from the music!) But, I just thought this is a great LOCAL charity and any money we raise will be well used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend, Suzanne Choate, sent me the following message about Adopt-A-Family.  She is collecting donations and then doing the shopping for these local girls in need.  Read on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;This year my gift to some people on my list is to give to  charity.  I've  chosen the Adopt-A-Family program through United  Way.  They have directed  me to New Hope Manor in Manchester where  troubled teen girls are housed in a  residential setting.  I am  fulfilling  a couple of girls wish lists,  but there are more  available....Just an idea...I will do the shopping!&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest a donation of $5 or more, but please feel free to give anything you can.  Suzanne is a skilled shopper and will make the most of the funds we raise, no matter how much or how little.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the normal spiel: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking to meet other parents, and make friends for your kids, while having fun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Parents of Children ages birth-5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for 30 minutes of Family Style Music activities, followed by casual &amp;quot;getting to know you's&amp;quot;!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great music for young children and adults--no boring or annoying music here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relaxed class, where the only rules are to have fun and be safe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meet other area parents with similar interests!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Babies, toddlers, and preschoolers are all welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perfect for siblings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula Penna</member_name><member_id>8325760</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292987942000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Families</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Hartford-Area-Parents-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1316784</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5199966431</group_lon><name>The Greater Hartford Area  Parents Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291395046000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>M.M.M.M.M.
