<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello all, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I have had this online as a poll to see if we should post it as an official meetup - unfortunately the response was very low, so I just thought I would go ahead and post it for those interested.  I don't even know if I will make it as we have a friend in town that weekend but if she is up for it, we will be there.  Claudia you seem keen on the idea so maybe you can take the lead on this one?  Can you suggest a spot to meet?  We can also change the date - it runs Saturday and Sunday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!  Hope to see you all at the grill this Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Taylor</member_name><member_id>1999104</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191279734000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190315081000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oktoberfest in Pawtucket</name><id>6397223</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191106800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/6397223/</event_url></item>
