After teaching at MIT for 21 years, he returned to Harvard in 2003 as the Johnstone Professor of Psychology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinkerâ€™s experimental research on cognition and language won the Troland Award from the National Academy of Sciences, the Henry Dale Prize from the Royal Institute of Great Britain, and two prizes from the American Psychological Association. He has also received several honorary doctorates and numerous awards for graduate and undergraduate teaching, general achievement, and his critically acclaimed books The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works, The Blank Slate, and The Stuff of Thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinker has also appeared in many television documentaries and writes frequently in the popular press, including The New York Times, Time, and the New Republic. Earlier this year, he was designated a Harvard College Professor in recognition of his efforts in undergraduate education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;This event is part of the&lt;br /&gt;Harvard University Division of Continuing Education's&lt;br /&gt;Annual &lt;a href="http://hilr.harvard.edu/events/pinker.jsp" target="_blank"&gt;Robert C.
