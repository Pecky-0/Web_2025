this event last year and it was a nice way to spend an evening!
There were about 15 drummers, a few people dancing around the
campfire, tiki torches, kids in facepaint, and families picnicking.
Bring a lawn chair or a blanket to sit on and some food to snack
on. Or bring your drum, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&amp;nbsp;Celebrate a spring evening with drumming and dancing
around a fire! We'll dance and play to a mix of traditional African
rhythms and organized rhythm jams. You're welcome to bring your own
hand drums and percussion, or simply come to dance and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is about listening to each other, co-creating music
and dancing our spirit. It's in a beautiful location, under the
nearly full moon, a few days before summer solstice. While many of
us have studied drumming for years, others are new to the drum. We
all can learn from each other as we create magical, danceable
rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is free and open to all ages and experience levels.
Bring music from your heart and a sharing spirit. Please bring
water to drink and snacks if you like. 
&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;No alcohol!&lt;/span&gt; If you
like to play while sitting, consider bringing a lightweight chair
(we're a 4 minute walk from parking.)"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
