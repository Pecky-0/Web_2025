Mutate a brave new hero and be ready to take on just about anything! Experience the return of an old classic in a new play experience using the D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition rules engine! The D&amp;amp;D Gamma World game is a fast, furious romp through a post-apocalyptic Earth where mutant heroes face-off against killer robots, alien weirdness, and strange irradiated creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gamma World Game Day: Trouble in Freesboro&lt;br /&gt;Itâ€™s shocking how the Big Mistake completely obliterated some places while others got by relatively unscathed. Freesboro falls into the latter camp, but if Genghis Tangh has his way, life will never be the same for the mutants of Gamma Terra. Delve into the origins of the Big Mistake as you take on Tangh and his forces! Pick up a D&amp;amp;D Gamma World Boxed Set, a few booster packs of power cards, and create your own characters in an exciting new Game Day experience! A D&amp;amp;D Gamma World Game Day adventure designed for 4-6 characters of 1st level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exclusive 4-hour adventure called Trouble in Freesboro, written by Robert Schwalb, includes an online feature to the game that if accessed during game play can provide the players with a valuable clue. Players purchase 2 D&amp;amp;D Gamma World booster packs and create their own characters when they arrive at a participating location to play. DMs are required to have a copy of the D&amp;amp;D Gamma World Boxed Set and the adventure materials, available prior to the event day in the game day kit, to prepare to run their game. In addition to a poster map and the adventure, the game day kit also contains 2 different D&amp;amp;D Gamma World cards, available nowhere else, and awarded to players and DMs just for participating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important Note:  You MUST purchase at least two Gamma World booster packs in order to participate in the adventure.  These booster packs contain cards that enhance and customize your character in unique ways as befits a post-apocalyptic radioactive wasteland.  Veteran's Gaming will have the booster packs on sale on site at the event, so you can just show up, grab your cards, and make your character for the adventure.  Time will be given for character creation at the start of the event and all other materials for participating will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me wearing a Blue D&amp;D Bowling Shirt</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289067527000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283877689000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worldwide D&amp;D Gameday:  D&amp;D Gamma World Boxed Set</name><id>14684585</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1289062800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/14684585/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
