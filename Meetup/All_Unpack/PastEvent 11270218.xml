If you get off at Kendall Square, near the Marriott side of the T station is a mini-Food Court where you can grab a sandwich or something to tide you over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Microsoft New England Research &amp;amp; Development Center (NERD):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newengland/"&gt;http://research.micro...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Opened in July 2008, &lt;b&gt;Microsoft Research New England&lt;/b&gt; continues to build on Microsoft’s commitment to collaborate with the broader research community and to advance the state of the art in multiple areas of computing research. The lab, located at the Microsoft New England Research &amp;amp; Development Center, is pursuing new, interdisciplinary areas of research that bring together core computer scientists and social scientists to understand, model, and enable the computing and online experiences of the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Microsoft Research New England focuses on interdisciplinary work, integrating the more mathematical and algorithmic sciences with both the social sciences and aspects of the biomedical sciences. Our work includes applied projects in areas such as economics, social media, and health care, as well as more theoretical projects in areas such as mathematics and cryptography. The researchers in our lab collaborate closely with the vibrant local academic community. Our primary goal is to advance the state of the art in interdisciplinary research, and our research also enhances Microsoft products and services both through direct transfer of technology and through impact on Microsoft strategy&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the NERD Logo:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Microsoft Unveils Logo for “NERD&lt;/u&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert Buderi 7/8/09&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Microsoft’s New England Research &amp;amp; Development Center at One Memorial Drive here in Cambridge, MA—NERD, as it is so affectionately called inside and outside the company—has quickly become one of the central gathering spots for the Boston tech community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In late March, the company opened a big conference area on its second floor, and almost from day one has been making it available for free to a variety of outside groups—from Tech Tuesdays to the Environmental Defense Fund, which just last week held an unconference about green business practices at NERD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Well, as part of that welcoming spirit, I guess you would call it, the company has quietly posted its logo for the facility. The logo shows the Boston skyline (roughly as seen from NERD) in shaded blue, and the stylized Longfellow Bridge connecting it with Cambridge in orange. 'We kind of flipped the switch this morning,' says Sara Spalding, senior director of NERD. 'We really felt that we wanted to have a design that reflected our presence her in the greater Boston area, and Cambridge in particular.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Out to get to the bottom of the story in true hard-hitting journalistic fashion, I asked her if there was a deep symbolism behind the logo, such as a metaphorical bridge linking Microsoft with the larger Boston innovation scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Nope. 'There’s no clever reverse image or play it backwards on your stereo,'she says. 'There’s no deeper meaning.'&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://microsoftcambridge.com/About/Directions/tabid/89/Default.aspx"&gt;http://microsoftcambr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;u&gt;Public Transportation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;On the T, take the Red Line to the Kendall/MIT stop.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Walk straight up Main Street toward the Longfellow Bridge (past the Post Office, Bank of America).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You will see the Parking Garage on your right, Take a right and you can enter the building from the side.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Approximately a 5 minute walk&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better directions&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/newengland/visit.aspx"&gt;http://research.micro...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Upon exiting the MBTA station, you will be on Main Street. Walk approximately 3 blocks East on Main St. towards the Longfellow Bridge, and Boston. Landmarks you will pass include: Kendall Square Post Office, Kendall Flowers, Kendall Drugs, and Bank of America. Cross Wadsworth Street and proceed one more block to One Memorial Drive, the pink stone and green glass tower on your right just before you come to the Longfellow Bridge.
