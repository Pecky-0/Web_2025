In modern society where world is becoming smaller and the boundaries are fast diminishing we often see people from all different cultures coexisting peacefully, in some cases protecting their culture at heart and in other cases  redefining a brand new culture. In this discussion we will talk about what culture mean to us and how does it influence our personal development. Some of the topics we might emphasis on are following:&lt;br /&gt;• What is culture? &lt;br /&gt;• The importance of culture in human development.&lt;br /&gt;• How does culture affect our personal identity?&lt;br /&gt;• Dose culture influences the way we think or the way we think influences the culture.&lt;br /&gt;• Why do people in different cultures listen, understand and react differently?&lt;br /&gt;• Does the art belong to the artist or to the culture? &lt;br /&gt;• Can a unified culture help us to build a better world for all?&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at the back side of the restaurant close to children's play area</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233539630000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226702024000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The importance of culture and its influence to us</name><id>9164515</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227312000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/9164515/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/e/0/global_3173088.jpeg</photo_url></item>
