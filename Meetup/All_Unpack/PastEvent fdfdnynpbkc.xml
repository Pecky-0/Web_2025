We had a lot of fun, and of course all of our Puggies we absolutely adorable in the costumes! Congratulations to our costume contest winners Georgie and Lucy the Patriots Quarterback and Cheerleader! See the pictures that Laura so graciously posted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Holidays coming up we know everyone is going to be VERY busy, so we will have a November Meetup, but not a December one.  We will have a Pug Toy Swap, so please bring one dog toy for each pug you bring with you so we can all swap and every pug will get something. So if you have one pug, bring one toy to swap, if you have three, bring three...etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This months Meetup money will go to getting our generous host, Bob the owner of Gibson Kennels a gift card for Christmas as a &amp;quot;Thank you&amp;quot; for letting us have our monthly meetings there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last months money paid for the monthly dues and the prizes for the costume contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another quick note: We have so much fun at these meetups, but all comes with a small price to us as organizers. We do ask that each family pay a small $5 fee at the door when you arrive to each meetup so please be sure to bring that with you as your &amp;quot;ticket&amp;quot; in. It costs us money each month to be a member of this website, we always provide sweets and drinks and prizes and decorations all cost money. Any leftover, are donated to Pug Rescue organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and I truly enjoy being the Organizers of the Grafton pug Meetup. We hope that we have met each of you individually, and if we have not, please come up and introduce yourself at the next one. We are constantly trying to come up with new treats for our precious pugs, and ideas to keep it informative and interesting. We welcome all suggestions. It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun.  We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and play in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. Note: &lt;b&gt;this is a PUG Meetup&lt;/b&gt;...as not all breeds play well together.  There are other small breed Meetups, but this is for PUGS ONLY!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this has not been strictly enforced at the Meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will ask for a $5 fee per family for each Meetup&lt;/b&gt; to cover Meetup costs and any leftover money will be donated to the Curly Tail Pug Rescue as well as other animal related charity that we all agree on as a group. These donations go toward paying the monthly dues, snacks and to keep this website going so we can all see when the next Meetup is taking place.  We will also do special events from time to time to keep it fun and interesting!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will introduce ourselves...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erin maguire</member_name><member_id>3828727</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth Mott</member_name><member_id>6811754</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>10300396</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290969111000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>fdfdnynpbkc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290880800000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/15293191/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/b/global_10981051.jpeg</photo_url></item>
