(art, history, and architecture).  The group has gone many times and it's always fun.  The theme for this evening, March 11, is Community Places and Sacred Spaces.  When you look on the calendar (link below) you will see that many events are linked to NB's unique spaces. There are also lectures, gallery shows, and live music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the AHA! website: &lt;a href="http://www.ahanewbedford.org/calendar.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ahanewbedf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One great event tonight is the concert of African drumming, dance, and song at the Zeiterion at 6. I've seen this group perform before and they are amazing! For a change, let's meet at the Z at 6. In case we get split up we can meet in the lobby afterwards and then decide what to do. Another suggestion is the UMass Dartmouth MFA exhibit at the Star Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we check out a bunch of events, we'll grab some dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can park for free on the street after 6, or if you decide to come much earlier just bring a couple quarters for the meters.  My cell number is 773-304-8846, just in case you need to get ahold of me on the day of the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come out for a night of free entertainment!  Hope to see you there.  This is a joint event with WINGS.  Please RSVP on just one site.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>in the theater b/c event starts at 6 -- look for me there or in the lobby afterward!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1274033079000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272918212000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AHA! night in New Bedford</name><id>13371526</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273788000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/13371526/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
