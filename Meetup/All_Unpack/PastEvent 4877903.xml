<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>860 acre forested park with Chapman Falls with overall drop of 60 feet over a series of steps. This hike is about 3 miles and staying mostly on the red and yellow trails (Millington and Witch Hazel trails). Potholes near the falls are the finest example of such features in this part of the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking area near the picnic pavilion at 2 PM. The hike is anticipated to take about 1.5 hours and should be done by about 3:30 PM. A trail map can be found at the park link provided. If there is interest, we'll find a place to eat afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions can be found at the location link on this event. Kevin S will lead and is the contact for this one. I'm sorry for such short notice on posting this event but I hope many of you can join in on the hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I plan to offer a second hike to this park of about the same length but on different trails in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/devilshopyard.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/devilshopyard.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1142541863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at Devil's Hopyard SP in E.
