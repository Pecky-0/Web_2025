Bring your laptop and enjoy the free WiFi access.  Bring some stories about things you're trying to do with Linux, and the group may be able to help you out.  My most recent interests are related to merging Ham Radio with Linux, and with my device driver for the Delcom USB I/O demo board.  I'm also getting used to Kubuntu and could use some help with managing multiple network configurations - are there any Ubuntu/Debian experts out there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Java Room has great coffee and desserts, as well as soda and water.  Come visit us if you are interested in Linux.  Everybody is welcome, regardless of your expertise level (remember:  we were all newbies once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andy Stewart</member_name><member_id>3117855</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172275286000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Linux Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>linux-393</urlname><id>304994</id><group_lat>42.6199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>The Chelmsford Linux Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171728150000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Linux @ The Java Room</name><id>5489116</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172102400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/linux-393/events/5489116/</event_url></item>
