Join us at 8pm for dinner/appetizers/drinks/whatever and some team trivia action.  You don't have to be a master of trivia, and we get to huddle (as a team) before turning in any answers, so there is *NO* pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gas Lamp Grille Features: Great Food, Exotic Beers, Music, sports on their several large-screen plasma televisions, and most importantly, yours truly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trivia starts around 9:00 and goes pretty quickly.  We'll meet at 8:00 so we have time to chat and taunt the other teams with our patented triple Ts (Trivia Trash-Talking).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the Bar - Adam is 5'8" with short dark brown hair, cell: (401) 699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259195875000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257549154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Gas Lamp Grille - EARLY Monday Trivia</name><id>11815266</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258419600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/11815266/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/e/global_11672510.jpeg</photo_url></item>
