We'll provide the games unless you have something really fun you want to bring. And of course we'll all bring the delicious food. I think we should do Buddha Hut before the next scheduled meetup since so many people want to go there too. I'll set it up through here for a couple of weeks from now. I hope to see you all there on Sunday and Have a great and safe New Year's tonight!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions you can reach me at 508-459-1074 or you can email me as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dreads, glasses and a whole lot of veganess ;)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309486802000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228677217000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp January Meetup</name><id>9296788</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231092000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/9296788/</event_url></item>
