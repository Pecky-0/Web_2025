<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;The volley ball season is ending, but that does not mean we should stop having fun! The &lt;span&gt;Wednesday evening&lt;/span&gt; Jenness Beach gang is getting together for a pot luck party at Karen's house in &lt;span&gt;Dover&lt;/span&gt;. We'll turn on the lights, set up the net and play. Bring some food and/or drink to share and any games you like to play. Just like the infamous After Party, we'll have an outdoor fire and maybe even s'mores (hint, hint Ted). If you have an iPod with good tunes, bring that too! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please let us know what you are bringing when you RSVP so we can plan the menu. Paper goods and wood provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The location will be sent to you via email after you sign up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>9389653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318304336000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317779210000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of the Season Volleyball Bash</name><id>36184302</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318111200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/36184302/</event_url></item>
