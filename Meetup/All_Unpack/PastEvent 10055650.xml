We can also go have a drink after the show – at the Foundation Lounge, unless I can think of a better place between now and then. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ji&amp;#345;í Kylián was born in Prague and studied at the Prague Conservatory, among other places.  He became the artistic director (as well as coreographer) for Nederlands Dans Theater in 1978.  I saw Boston Ballet perform a series of his pieces in February (Black &amp;amp; White @ the Wang) and it was wonderful.  I was a bit surprised that Boston Ballet did them, because they are clearly not ballet.  The pieces are modern dance – creative, funny, visually sparkling, modern dance.  (Or, as one of the reviewers put it:  “Black and White and contemporary all over.”)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to Kylián’s work, the program also includes works by Paul Lightfoot and Sol Leon.  I haven’t seen any of their work, but the reviews are good.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.
