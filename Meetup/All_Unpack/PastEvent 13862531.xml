The band will be performing at The rock from 7-9. Anyone who's been there before knows you need to get there early. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can meet at the field closest to the conference center parking lot. You can bring coolers, snacks, chairs and bug spray. They also have food trucks nearby. For all of those with children the carnival is also going on at St John's. It's a great event and a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is always difficult.  You can park at West Haven High School and walk or any of the lots for a fee of usually $10.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278720420000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
