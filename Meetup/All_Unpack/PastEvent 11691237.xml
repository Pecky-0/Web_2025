How about something completely different -- like&lt;br /&gt;crispy wontons layered with scallions, pear and flambeed shrimp, or crepes filled with sweet, spicy satay? Let's take a culinary journey to your choice of Cambodia or France, by way of the Waltham Elephant Walk. . . conveniently located near Waltham's Embassy Cinema, which offers a number of interesting films for our afternoon entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;There's a three course prix fixe brunch for $20, or you can pick and choose individual dishes and have a great meal for approximately $12-$15. Check out the brunch menu on the restaurant web site for more info. (And if you're interested in a movie, you can click &lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/Boston/EmbassyCinema.htm" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the featured films for Sunday.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have a car (we know some members don't) we may be able to help you get a ride out to Waltham. . . as long as you are also interested in staying on for a movie. Email us to discuss further before you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your $2 reservation fee will be added to the tip for our table.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation is in Iris's name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256658206000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256263033000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at Elephant Walk (and maybe a movie after)</name><id>11691237</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256484600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/11691237/</event_url></item>
