I had to wait 15 minutes for a space to park. Since so many new members have joined, we really need a parking lot with ample room for all of our cars. The Stoneham location has a nice large parking lot and plenty of space to set up our tables for identification after the hunt. I apologize for any inconvenience the switch has caused anyone. I tried to keep the location as close to Winchester as possible to accommodate our members in that area. See you there.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>4 Woodland Rd Stoneham,Ma. next to John Flynn Skating Rink</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jean Saunders</member_name><member_id>13202391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348591614000</updated><rating><average>4.17000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fungi's &amp; gils</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mushroom-Lovers-USA</urlname><id>1497456</id><group_lat>42.4700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>Mushroom Lovers USA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347307382000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New location for Sept.22nd hunt.
