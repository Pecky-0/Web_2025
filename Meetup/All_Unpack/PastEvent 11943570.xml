Trivia teams are comprised of six people each. An emcee reads the question, and the team bids a certain number of points per question, based on confidence level. The team with the most points, wins a prize, usually a gift certificate to Chuck's.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign, and I will give out my cell# closer to the event.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorena Nozzolillo</member_name><member_id>4168426</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260057044000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259027340000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia at chuck's in Auburn</name><id>11943570</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259883000000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/11943570/</event_url></item>
