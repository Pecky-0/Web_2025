Please help at the October work party 10 am to 1 pm. We'll tend the Friends East Entrance Native Plant Garden and Picnic Area and send out a trash collection team if we have enough volunteers. Lunch will be provided to anyone who helps out. The Friends Trail begins at the picnic area, so you can go for a nice hike after lunch, if you aren't too tired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address is approximate for those of you who use navigation systems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FMSSF East Entrance Native Plant Garden is on Long Pond Road and Alden Road (in the forest) at the parking area. You'll see picnic tables on the left side of the road and the parking area on the right side as you enter the forest.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288130572000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286303593000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MSSF Work Party</name><id>15010728</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287324000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/15010728/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/0/global_18518784.jpeg</photo_url></item>
