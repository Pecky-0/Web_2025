Now the book is a movie, with Daniel Craig as Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. North Darmouth Mall, according to the AMC website, sells tickets for $6.75 on Thursday nights. The movie starts at 7pm, so we will meet at 6:45 in the lobby. I am tall, with chin-length hair and thick glasses. I'll be wearing a black and white coat. We'll have Gretchen from the book club along as well; she is average height with curly red hair. Afterwards, we will go to TGI Friday's on Rt. 6 to discuss the movie. The movie is nearly 2 hours and 40 min long, so we probably won't get to TGIF until 10pm. Whether or not you read the book, come join us!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326481743000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326252674000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last minute movie: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</name><id>47605482</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326411900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/47605482/</event_url></item>
