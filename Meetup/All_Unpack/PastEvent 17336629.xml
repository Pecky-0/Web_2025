Come when you want. There are places nearby to pick up a lunch (maybe we'll place an order for pizza or &amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying an experiment and want to limit this open studio to anyone interested in painting.&amp;nbsp;This isn't a workshop &amp;mdash; we'll be working independently, but beginners and more experienced are welcome. Acrylics, watercolors and if no one minds we could accept oil paints as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll set up a still life or two to work from, but you don't need to use them. Bring small items or photos to work from or just use your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can help anyone who needs to stretch a canvas &amp;mdash; just bring all the supplies needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the time to  finish up any painting you've already started. We can have a second session next month to continue painting. We always have fun at these smaller Meetups.  Sign up now to join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like us to hold some basic painting workshops at ArtStudio 360 please let me know. And what media are you interested in? Watercolor or acrylics and/or oils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAY/TIME: &lt;/strong&gt;Sunday, May 22, from 1 pm to ???? (Really, we'll stay  as late as anybody wants to stay!) Come for an hour or two; come for the  whole afternoon and into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGENDA:&lt;/strong&gt; No scheduled activities. Arrive and leave when you want. Work  on your own projects at your own pace. The only thing we ask is that  you keep your RSVP up to date so we know who's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some  tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave,  toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are  interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt; $10 to help defray the Studio rental costs. (ArtStudio 360 renters attend free.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: &lt;/strong&gt;Any member of the NE ATC+ Meetup and up to two guests (18+ only, please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP: &lt;/strong&gt;These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting  list. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function.  Please RSVP for your guests as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP  accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING: &lt;/strong&gt;Your own materials and projects to work on (just as  you do for the regular Meetup). But basic supplies -- scissors, glue,  tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are available for your use. An easel if you have one and want to use it or loan it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;In the unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even  if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web  site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side,  please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio  360!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>2nd floor; see invitation for other details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pat</member_name><member_id>4858394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306164656000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>You enjoy painting, but never get around to it.
