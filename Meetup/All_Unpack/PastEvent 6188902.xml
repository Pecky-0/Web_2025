I worked my magic and specials are as follows:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Appetizers including Pizza slices, Fruit and Brie Platter, and Cocktail Sandwiches will be included for free.  There will be enough for a party of 35 to 40 people with an emphasis on our Pizza.   &lt;br /&gt;2) Drink specials on Mojitos and Draft Beer.  (unless your parties prefer other types of drinks like wine and Martinis then we'll run a special on that instead)  &lt;br /&gt;3) Flexible room setup.  You tell me what works best. We can have tables for 30 to almost 40 people or we can leave it open for easier mingling.    &lt;br /&gt;4) I may be able to throw in some limited free parking for about 10 or 12 cars.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the date gets closer, I will work on finding out exactly what are drink specials will be.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Please Please RSVP so we can tell Carlos (Manager of Cosi) if he should plan on more food.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reminder, please ask for individual tabs from your bartender/waiter  for food and drink  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact is Robyn-Allise 203-823-5302.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...   &lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.   &lt;br /&gt;Ever!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>25</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190306085000</updated><rating><average>4.21999979019</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>41</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187230426000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>9/17 Monday HAPPY Hour at Cosi's!!</name><id>6188902</id><headcount>36</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190066400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6188902/</event_url></item>
