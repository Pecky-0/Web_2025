Later on, we'll decide exactly where to meet and what type of 'meetup' sign or signal we'll have so we can find each other..the concert's at 7:00 pm..maybe we can all bring snacks and share with each other??? Then, after the concert, maybe meet somewhere for ice cream /dessert, whatever...sounds like fun! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ellen</member_name><member_id>4148667</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182340300000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>425314</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Jewish Singles 55+  of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177439706000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oldies Concert at the Hatch Shell!</name><id>5704303</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1182020400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston/events/5704303/</event_url></item>
