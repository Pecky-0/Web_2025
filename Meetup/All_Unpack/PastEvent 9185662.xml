Reservations have been made at the Garden Grille Cafe in Pawtucket for 7:00 p.m. this Saturday evening.   Please RSVP... ASAP.   I have made reservations for up to 15 people.   (If there will be more... I have until Friday to change.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first meet-up will basically be a meet &amp;amp; greet.   We will discuss ideas for sharing, teaching and leading others in the way of the Vegetarian Lifestyle.   We will discuss our future meet-ups... the where's, what's and to-do's.... including &amp;quot;movie nights&amp;quot;!   (Apparently, there are a whole slew of Vegetarian movies out there that I did not know existed!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm very excited to meet all of you!   You will be helping me to learn and grow in this uncharted area of my life... and hopefully many, many more to come in the future!   (And I thank you so much for joining, sharing and caring!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEE YOU THERE!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kerrie Amatelli</member_name><member_id>2732003</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229292139000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Vegetarian/Vegan Enthusiast</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood</urlname><id>1312890</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Vegetarian and Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227024556000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our FIRST Vegetarian / Organic Group Meet-Up!</name><id>9185662</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227398400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood/events/9185662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/2/8/global_6156808.jpeg</photo_url></item>
