Adobe style!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us this month to eat, socialize, ask questions and share anything you might have to offer about any of the many Adobe wonderful products.&amp;nbsp; Bring a dish or snack food to share along with your wish list of possible topics to cover in future meetings ... we can always use your great suggestions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more topic of discussion ... we really do need your help!!&amp;nbsp; Last month Penny brought up the topic of us pulling together to make a donation to the President's Fund.&amp;nbsp; While there is no set amount that we need to collect, we do want to show the President our appreciation for allowing us to use one of the school's rooms to hold our meetings every month.&amp;nbsp; Your donations are tax deductible, so if you think you can help us out please bring your checkbooks along with your Holiday Spirit!!&amp;nbsp; We haven't been asked to pay to use this space, but it is something that could happen if they feel we are taking advantage of their generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penny and I hope to see everyone on Thursday night at 6:00pm.&amp;nbsp; For those of you who can't make it, we'd like to wish you a very Happy Adobe Holiday!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
