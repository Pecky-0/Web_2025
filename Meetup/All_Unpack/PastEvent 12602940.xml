Whether you're already working on a journal and want to share it or need your colleagues' advice on turning a blank book into a work of art, this is the session for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;Please note, though:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This is a play date, not a class; we won't be offering any formal instruction this time. But we'll have a blast while learning from each other, and we may have some workshops down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAY/TIME:&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, March 7, from 1 p.m. to ???? (Really, we'll stay as late as anybody wants to stay!) Arrive and leave when you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/b&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (professional-strength paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST: $10 per person.&lt;/b&gt; This helps cover the cost of renting our space. Exact change is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/b&gt; Any member of the NE ATC+, Altered Art/Assemblage or Mass Journaling Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your own journal, if you have one (or even some cardstock or chipboard to make journal pages). Any kind of journal will do; the format is up to you. (If you'd like to alter an old book, we have plenty available.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; The craft supplies you'll need during the session. No supplies? No problem. Basic tools -- scissors, glue, acrylic paint, collage materials, etc. -- are available for your use at no charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something to drink (optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; Snacks to share (optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/b&gt; RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function so we know who's coming and how many to expect.
