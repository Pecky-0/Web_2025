&lt;p&gt;This path has Quite a bit to offer.  Water Falls, Canals from days of old,  wildlife, the Blackstone River, to name a few. The path is relatively flat, with just one  incline.  The total ride is 22 miles, but I start in the middle, so you can go less, if  you need too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I Ride Bike Paths, I usually split into several Groups.  This allows everyone to go at a speed they are comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are Restrooms where we are meeting.  They are cleaner than most bachelors bathrooms.  They also sell Coffee, Doughnuts, Ice Cream, etc. at the Rest Stop. If some of you want Food and Drink,  you can stop at either Route 122 Mendon Road  or Route 114.  You cross both Roads, when you leave the Tourist Center, heading Route 295 North.  Feel free to pick an establishment.  I am told F G &amp;amp; G like to Party.  LOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions:  The Tourist Center is only Accessible from Route 295 North.  It is Located between  exits 9 &amp;amp; 10 on Route 295 North.  from the Worcester Area,   146 South to Route 295 North.  The  Tourist Stop, is just ahead about 1 mile or so.  From the East Bay, 195 West, 95 North, 146 North, Route 295 North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming from  the North, I would go 295 South, I would get off at Route 146 &amp;amp; get on 295 North. ( Not exactly sure how that works, but i know it is doable. Sounds like the last words of Johnny Knoxville or Steve O.  ).   The Tourist Center is just ahead about 1 Mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
