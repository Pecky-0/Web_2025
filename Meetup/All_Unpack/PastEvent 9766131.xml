This evening is their first of 4 qualifying evenings at 4 different locations. Competitors sign in starting at 7 PM and the competition starts at 8 PM. There is no charge for either competing or watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be competing. You are free to compete too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This venue is pretty small and the contest usually draws a big crowd, so I can't guarantee that I'll be able to save seats for everyone, so get here early to stake out space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to get here by 7 to sign in right away but I might disappear for awhile, if I can, to warm up my voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can discuss how to handle meeting and seating when you sign up to attend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you don't know me already, I'll make some arrangement after you sign up"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>NeilL</member_name><member_id>3034835</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236472128000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234935389000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karaoke Contest </name><id>9766131</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236124800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/9766131/</event_url></item>
