The entire path is roughly 26 miles round trip, but since we're starting from the middle, riders can simply do half the ride for a total of around 13 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet ON THE BIKE PATH in front of Shaws, right next to the brown wooden signboards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to be wearing my stylish bike helmet, and I suggest (but do not require) that you do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few (non-alcoholic) beverage and ice cream vendors on the way, so feel free to bring a few dollars for refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red car and a red bike, also I have a cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277680016000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276999555000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biking the East Bay (BARRINGTON start point) 13 OR 26 miles</name><id>13852166</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277562600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/13852166/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/5/0/global_12002896.jpeg</photo_url></item>
