This will be a great alternative to the crowded and loud bar scene.  Herbâ€™s party will be fun, with a quiet and intimate setting where you have a chance to have a conversation with the people around you.   For the first two hours we will enjoy hanging out and eating Thanksgiving dishes and junk food.  At 9:00 Herb will lead an informal, fun and meaningful discussion about gratitude.  Afterwards we might resume hanging out or tell stories.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The party is also a potluck so if you can please bring a vegetarian dish/snack or candy!  This being The Unique Journey, feel free to wear a Halloween costume (every day should be Halloween)!   Costumes and potluck items are optional, but there is a $10.00 cover charge (which is much less than what other events are charging). The party goes from 7:00 - 11:00 so feel free to come and go whenever you want.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259626186000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257469790000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Unique Thanksgiving Party</name><id>11807892</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259452800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/11807892/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/a/global_11663466.jpeg</photo_url></item>
