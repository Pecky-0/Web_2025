You Black Emperor) that just put out an amazing new record, "Waking Season."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen them many times in the past and they've always left me with the impression that while they had potential, they just need time to mature as a group to really nail that particular sound. I think they've finally done it with this latest one; it's on my short list for favorite albums of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video will melt a hole in your computer's face: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sinclair is the shiny new venue in Harvard Square that is having a horrible time getting its doors open. Liquor license problems, construction delays, neighborhood sourpusses; the rumors abound. Let's hope they can get their shit together in time for this show. I'll be pissed if the second act I buy for this venue gets pushed to another club.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff</member_name><member_id>8416626</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354932926000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353892869000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Caspian @ The Royale</name><id>92791642</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354921200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/92791642/</event_url></item>
