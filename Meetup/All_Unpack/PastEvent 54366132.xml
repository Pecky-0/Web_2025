They are doing phone banking for a get out the vote effort, their primary is this Tuesday! Phone banking is from 1 to 5, I will have to leave around 4:30pm due to a previous engagement but I am very excited to check this place out. Their website is &lt;a href="http://www.libertyclubhouse.org" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.libertyclubhouse.org&lt;/a&gt;. At this point it's just me (Sara is RSVP'd but may or may not make it) and I'm willing to leave a little later if it will help get more people up there. Please call 860-730-3RON to give me a heads up if you want to me to wait a bit for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330956432000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330540988000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Phone Banking at the Liberty Clubhouse</name><id>54366132</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330794000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/54366132/</event_url></item>
