If you have an extra Scrabble board that is easy to tote along, please bring it.   As our first official all-Scrabble event, hopefully all of you word lovers will have a wonderful time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the games have been played from 7:00-9:00, the group will head over to In a Pig's Eye for food and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number listed below is Cynthia's number, not the number to Cornerstone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll find Cynthia in the Cornerstone Cafe with her Scrabble set.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199728709000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1199121776000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scrabble Night</name><id>6999916</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199491200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/6999916/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/5/global_2882981.jpeg</photo_url></item>
