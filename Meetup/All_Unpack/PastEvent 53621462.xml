In rhyme &amp;amp; out, Bruce will entertain you with his energetic and engaging takes on personal mishaps, outdoor epiphanies &amp;amp; humorous 'made-up stuff'. A firm believer that we all have tales to tell, Bruce will also lead all participants in fun, easy exercises where they can share their best wildlife encounters, camping disasters and other memorable outdoor experiences. Don't miss what promises to be a lively, worthwhile and interactive evening of outdoor tales! Appropriate for adults and children 8 and older.&amp;nbsp; Join us from 2-4pm.&amp;nbsp; Please also register by emailing Elizabeth Wylde at friendsoffreshpond@yahoo.com, or calling (617) 349-6489 and leaving your name and phone number. &lt;br /&gt;
