We begin the evening by going to the Boston University Observatory. Although the eclipse will not be occurring while at BU, I am confident (weather permitting) that at least one of the telescopes will be pointing at the full moon! Afterwards, we await the arrival of the total eclipse by having delicious ice cream at Cold Stone Creamery. Finally, we will see the eclipse! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be at the observatory from 7:30 - 8:30 and at Cold Stone from about 8:30 - 9:30.  At 9:30 we will find a good viewing spot of the total eclipse that occurs at 10:01.  We will watch the eclipse for a few minutes and call it a night.  Feel free to participate in as much or as little of the event as you want.  If you can only make the eclipse, then join us at the Cold Stone Creamery (957 Commonwealth Avenue) before 9:30.  If it is cloudy, Astronomy and Ice Cream will be postponed until March 5th.  However, we will have to wait until December 20th 2010 to see the next total lunar eclipse!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam</member_name><member_id>4049831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222558669000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202451829000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Astronomy and Ice Cream - Featuring a Total Lunar Eclipse!</name><id>7289056</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203553800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/7289056/</event_url></item>
