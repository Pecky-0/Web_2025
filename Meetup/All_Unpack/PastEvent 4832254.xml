<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi again. It looks like we may have a new meeting spot thats a little less 'me' dependent. I've talked with the folks at MESDA and they are very enthusisatic about getting a group going which we'll go over at the next meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then the MESDA info I'm not sure what you folks are interested in for presentation material, and open for ideas. There are always more specific details we can get into covering Rails, but I would love to get some more 'just Ruby' material covered. Feel free to let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unfamiliar with the Westbrook and are unsure where the MESDA offices are please let me know. I'll do my best to give some more details. It is fairly easy to find however, and is a large brick building with with a big sign out front.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick Stuart</member_name><member_id>2436503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ruby programmers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meruby</urlname><id>213431</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Portland Maine Ruby Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1137114366000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portland Maine Ruby February Meetup</name><id>4832254</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1140649200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meruby/events/4832254/</event_url></item>
