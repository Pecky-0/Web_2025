The sign wave starts at 4PM in the Campaign Visibility Area (CVA). The CVA will be on the southwest corner of the Dartmouth Green, which is located at the corner of N. Main Street and E. Wheelock Street. It will include all groups and campaigns wishing to express their free speech rights. Rules about CVA here: &lt;a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/debates/news/cva.html" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.dartmouth.edu/debates/news/cva.html&lt;/a&gt; . We will wave signs until almost 8PM, when the debate is scheduled to start. The debate watching party will take place at the Sigma Phi Epsilon House on 11 Webster Avenue. We are told that the house can accomodate about 200 (!!!) guests. The party is BYOB and snacks. The debate will go until 11PM. NOTE: The ticket lottery is over; if you didn't enter and win I don't think there's any way you can get into the actual debate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318368040000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1314031301000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign Wave at the Debate followed by Debate Watching Party!</name><id>30435961</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318363200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/30435961/</event_url></item>
