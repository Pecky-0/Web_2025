There is no particular destination or route and the Captain takes best advantage of the conditions to spend maximum time under sail power only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually sail through Lewis Bay over to the Pine Cove Wildlife Sanctuary, a beautiful unspoiled salt marsh up close. This area is inhabited with several species of protected marine and shore birds, including: osprey, black cormorant, blue heron, green heron, white egret, loon, swan, canada goose, various ducks, terns, sandpipers and gulls. Sometimes we see white tailed deer, red tail fox, and coyote on the shore. Nature lovers and children will be delighted. Here the only sounds are bird calls and wind in the rigging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quiet time of day with little distraction from other boat traffic. Enjoy your favorite beverage with a lobster roll, shrimp cocktail, or prime roast beef sandwich from our galley. For menu visit website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.catboat.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.catboat.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is $30.00 per ticket plus food/beverage. Each woman is responsible for her own ticket and food/drink.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Barbara will meet you by the Cat Boat ticket booth, wearing the Girls Just Wanna Have Fun pin!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barbara </member_name><member_id>7313867</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249147118000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
