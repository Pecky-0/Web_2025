So, what can I say about this movie?  That I liked 2 out of the last 4 Prince of Persia video games! And the trailer looks cool.  And... for the ladies... Jake Gyllenhaal!

[b]Details[/b]

We will go to the 7:10 movie.  I will wear my red meetup hat, which I found, yeah!

If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables by the big window. If the movie is downstairs, I'll be waiting behind the rope across from the refreshment stand. I'll be at the theater at 6:40, and we should go in and get seats 15 minutes before showtime, which would be 7:05.

I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.

If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

From the team that brought the "Pirates of the Caribbean" trilogy to the big screen, Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films present "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," an epic action-adventure set in the mystical lands of Persia and based on the video game of the same name. A rogue prince (Jake Gyllenhaal) reluctantly joins forces with a mysterious princess (Gemma Arterton) and together, they race against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Timeâ€”a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world.

[b]Trailer[/b]

Sigh. It looks like the "embed" code from YouTube is not working. So if you'd like to see a trailer that isn't clipped, click [url=&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ys-bUD_Uj4]here[/url" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ys-bUD_Uj4]here[/url&lt;/a&gt;] for the "official" Disney trailer.
