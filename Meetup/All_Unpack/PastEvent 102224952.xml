&lt;p&gt;I have rescheduled the meetup that was supposed to happen at Panera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hometown will actually accept a reservation so we don't have to be there at the crack of dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is for new people and the members who have been with us a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you show up just pay for your meal at the cash register and tell them you are with the Widow widowers group in the back room.  we have a limit of 20 people. If any of you new people are interested please sign up as soon as possible, as these events fill up fast.hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be collecting $1.00 from each person who comes this is to help with the meetup fees and web page. Jan is good enough to pay it up front and we need to help her pay for the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we have the back room!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Candy </member_name><member_id>10996899</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363024877000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Widows&amp;Widowers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Eastern-CT-Widows-and-Widowers-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1554695</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>The Eastern CT Widows and Widowers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1359590415000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>brunch at Hometown Buffett</name><id>102224952</id><headcount>17</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362841200000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Eastern-CT-Widows-and-Widowers-Meetup-Group/events/102224952/</event_url></item>
