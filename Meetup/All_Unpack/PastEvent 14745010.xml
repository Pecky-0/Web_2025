Storrow Drive is completely car-free, as is the entire 10 mile route. Marshals along all routes make sure there's plenty of space to ride. Tech support and ride snacks are free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The registration fee is $45 online. If you are unable to register online, there will be an on-site registration of $55 on the day of the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A portion of the proceeds from Hub On Wheels benefit Technology Goes Home, an www.openairboston.net  technology training program serving inner-city families through the Boston Public Schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have a bike but still want to ride? Reserve a bike today by contacting our official bike rental partner, Urban Adventours, at (800) 979-3370 or at www.urbanadventours.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are driving to the event, you can park at the Government Center Garage for $3.&lt;br /&gt;See the www.hubonwheels.org website to print out the parking coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to do the 30 mile ride which should take about 3-5 hours includes rest stops and needed breaks.  The ride starts at 8am.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have a meetup sign on my bike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note this is rain or shine.
