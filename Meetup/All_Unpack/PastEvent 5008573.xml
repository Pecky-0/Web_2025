<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 200 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 8:15 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 8:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have): &lt;br /&gt;I-84 East:&lt;br /&gt;* Get off at exit 35&lt;br /&gt;* **Follow 72 East to Exit 7 ( 1st exit on 72 )&lt;br /&gt;* Take right off exit onto 372 East&lt;br /&gt;* Follow this road for 2 miles&lt;br /&gt;* At fork in the road bear right on route 71A South&lt;br /&gt;* Follow 71a South 1.5 mi.&lt;br /&gt;* Turn right on West lane&lt;br /&gt;* Hike is 3 blocks down on the right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 84 West:&lt;br /&gt;* Stay in left lane &amp;amp; get off at exit 35&lt;br /&gt;* Get on 72 East &amp;amp; follow above directions (**)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I don't know of a map for this site***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
