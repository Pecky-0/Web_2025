Granville State Forest is right on the CT-MA border, just north of West Hartland.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 91, take Route 20 west past the airport, go 20 miles.  Turn right onto Milo Coe Road, which turns into West Hartland Road when you cross the state line and leads you right into the park.  We?ll meet at the parking lot near sites 8-12 at the campground at 1:00 PM.  (For those coming from Springfield, you can also get to the park via I-90 or Route 57.  Directions on the Massachusetts state park web site.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs on leashes are welcome, but Mass. State Parks do not allow alcohol.  Be sure to bring water and snacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP via the site before noon on Saturday as Gloria will not have access to a computer after that time and she is not sure there will be cell service at the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180458236000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179697322000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike!</name><id>5799447</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180285200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/5799447/</event_url></item>
