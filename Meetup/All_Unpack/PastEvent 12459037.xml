However, you can try to get on the waitlist, and I'll check my e-mail in the morning.  You will receive e-mail notification if you are moved to YES.  However--you MUST pay by noon in order to come to the event.  (you can pay online through Nerd Fun)  If you don't pay, then I'll allow someone else on the waitlist to come instead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Come have fun with other singles on Valentine's Day! (and help raise money for Haiti, too!)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Right now the male: female ratio is pretty balanced!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Join us at the June Bug Cafe in Jamaica Plain on Sunday, February 14th, from 2-5pm.&lt;/span&gt;  (directions below)  &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: violet"&gt;This is a multi-Meetup event, so only RSVP in one place--many people have RSVP'd through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/calendar/12444917/"&gt;Nerd Fun&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span style="color: violet"&gt; and paid online there&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:  June Bug Cafe is cash only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  (credit cards not accepted)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It'll be a relaxed event, we'll have the entire cafe to ourselves! We'll schmooze (chat), nosh on the muffins, cookies, bagels, sandwiches, soup, tea, coffee, bubble tea, and hot chocolate the cafe will have for sale*, and play board games &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;[(Update:  cafe owner thought she had a closet full of games, but doesn't--so please bring your own!)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Be generous with what you buy! The owner gave me a good price because this is a fundraiser. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, we'll play custom-made game show games, $20,000 Pyramid and Jeopardy, in a round-robin fashion that will let people get to know each other. Prizes will be given out! (of course, since this is a fundraiser, the prizes will be very small--or at least, very inexpensive!)  &lt;i&gt;So &amp;quot;Send in the clowns&amp;quot; because &amp;quot;there's a gas shortage&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Land of the lost&amp;quot; (hint:  these are categories in the game show)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Cost: $20, split between venue and donation for Haiti, to be given to &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/calendar/12362411/"&gt;Partners in Health&lt;/a&gt;.  If you'd like to make a larger donation, you're welcome to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to have made payment plans &lt;u&gt;with me&lt;/u&gt; by 10pm Saturday night in order to maintain your Yes RSVP. (There are 3 options for how to pay--one is through Nerd Fun, e-mail me for the other 2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it's Valentine's Day, and this event is for singles, I will do my best to ensure there is an even gender balance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So take this day to enjoy being single, hang out with friendly folk, maybe meet someone you like, and know that you're making a donation to people who are in dire need of our help.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want to help me? Decorate the site? Greet people the day of? Have a brilliant idea of something fun we can do? Let me know!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, thank you to the many people who filled out my survey about what type of event to hold; I got good ideas from reading your comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=junebug+cafe,+centre+street,+jamaica+plain,+ma,+usa&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ei=5CBiS-qqFYy6zgTzlbzWDg&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;view=map&amp;amp;cid=5717067922432661949&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;ved=0CB8QpQY&amp;amp;sa=X"&gt;Go to Googlemap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;b&gt;By car:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is plenty of street parking, especially in the Hi-Lo supermarket, or try surrounding streets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the Arborway/Jamaicaway.
