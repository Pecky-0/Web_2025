This show will have different dance styles competing against each other, such as Bhangra vs Bollywood vs Fusion vs Garba/Raas teams...which is the best? Come find out at the South Asian Showdown! The best teams from all over North America will be competing for the South Asian Showdown crown!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is on Feb 12th at 6pm at the John Hancock Hall in Boston. Tickets start at $20 and can be bought on line. If you want to sit with the group, you can pay for your ticket when you RSVP and I will purchase all the tickets together. This way the seats will all be together. You can also purchase tickets yourself but you won't have a seat with the rest of the group.

&lt;p&gt;The performance last fall lasted for four hours. I found about two hourse was enough. We can watch part of the show and the go somewhere afterwards, perhaps to an Indian restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be outside the entrance to the theater at 5:30.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297554001000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295121039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Asian Showdown 2011</name><id>16060183</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297549800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/16060183/</event_url></item>
