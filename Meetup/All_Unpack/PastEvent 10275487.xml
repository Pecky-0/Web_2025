Bring yourself and friends.   We’ll be getting 3 or 4 pool tables. Come meet our members, hear what the club is all about  and see what the club STILL has to offer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are an all year round ski and sports club with male and female members of all ages. We offer fun social activities all year round, ranging from hiking, canoeing, tubing, to skiing, snow shoeing and social gatherings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to ask us about our Summer volleyball league for beginners and intermediates as well as our 21st annual Tubing and BBQ event third weekend in July. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, call Paul at 617 699 4433.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat Top Johnnies&lt;br /&gt;1 Kendall Sq&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge, MA 02139&lt;br /&gt;(617) 494-9565 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redline Kendal Square and on street / garage parking is available nearby &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;Paul &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have 3 or 4 tables</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Fogel</member_name><member_id>8569503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244070510000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1342211</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Brettl-Hupfers Ski &amp; Sports Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240836454000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pool night at Flat Top Johnny's</name><id>10275487</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241739000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club/events/10275487/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/4/global_8373796.jpeg</photo_url></item>
