Not to mention their huge 1984 hit &amp;quot;Solid (as a rock)&amp;quot;. This is going to be an amazing night of 60's, 70's &amp;amp; 80's nostalgia. What we need to make it even better is a few cocktails, some food to share and most importantly....YOU!!! If you  have any doubts as to what a great evening is in store, just ask anyone who attended Herman's Hermits last Friday. This is what Summers were made for. I will be there around 6.30pm marking our territory. Anyone who needs to call or text me, my number is (203) 927-2534. I hope to see a lot of you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The obligatory Purple &amp; Yellow balloons</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248477509000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247418023000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ashford &amp; Simpson Free Concert</name><id>10858371</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247871600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/10858371/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/b/8/global_9617048.jpeg</photo_url></item>
