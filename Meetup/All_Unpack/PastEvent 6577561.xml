There will still be work to do in any case stuffing envelopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us in the new campaign headquarters for some phone banking of current supporters to get them to come to the 3 Nov event.  It's low pressure as these are current supporters, and we'll enjoy some pizza while we do it.  We will go from 6:30pm to 8:30pm&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193524766000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192762102000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Phone Banking</name><id>6577561</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193351400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6577561/</event_url></item>
