I know I need a new pair and I canâ€™t wait for this event.   &lt;br /&gt;Our sponsor, The Greater Boston Running Company is hosting a Gait Analysis and Sneaker Shopping Clinic for the SSFMG. Come learn about proper biomechanics, what your individual foot strike is like, and what type of sneakers would best fit your individual needs. Try on sneakers from a variety of brands until you find the perfect fit!  &lt;br /&gt;GBRC is offering 20% off all merchandise purchased at the event (excluding electronics) so a $100 pair of sneakers will only cost $80. In addition, with the purchase of sneakers, I will be passing out at least 5 $10 coupons to be used for a later purchase. &lt;br /&gt;This is one fun event you will not want to miss.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gait Analysis and Sneaker Shopping Clinic  &lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, April 13th at 6:30pm  &lt;br /&gt;Greater Boston Running Company  &lt;br /&gt;94 Derby Street Shoppes  &lt;br /&gt;Suite 213  &lt;br /&gt;Hingham, MA 02043  &lt;br /&gt;781-749-3800  &lt;br /&gt;www.greaterbostonrunningcompany.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: There is no minimum.
