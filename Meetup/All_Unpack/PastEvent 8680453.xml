Although you may not recognize Lessin and Deal by name, you are probably familiar with their work since they both produced Michael Moore's documentaries Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 911. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble the Water, however, is not a Michael Moore documentary but of home footage from filmmaker and musician Kimberly Rivers Roberts and her husband Scott juxtaposed with broadcast news coverage of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This documentary looks very promising as it has gotten very good reviews thus far (represented by a 96% Tomatometer rating on Rotten Tomatoes). Hopefully, this film will provide for some thoughtful dinner discussion afterward, as we recall Hurricane Katrina 3 years later in the wake of Hurricane Gustav.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The Kendall website says that the film will be playing at 4 pm on 9/13. I will check this a week from now (on 9/10) to confirm that the Kendall hasn't gone and changed this. If the time does change, I'll send an email to all the yeses and maybes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater after the film is over</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole</member_name><member_id>3185465</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221509680000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220467499000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trouble the Water - A Documentary about Hurricane Katrina</name><id>8680453</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221336000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8680453/</event_url></item>
