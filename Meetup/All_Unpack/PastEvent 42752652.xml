&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/3/1/4/event_77717172.jpeg" width="328" height="239" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;Our route, from the upper parking area north to Mount Roberts, will bring us through scrub-oak forest, and across several ledges with beautiful views. Trails vary from wide, flat carriage roads to rocky and steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a moderate hike with a couple of possible turning-back points if the group wants a shorter trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we go the whole way, the elevation gain is 1350&amp;rsquo; - Distance: 5.5 mi r/t - Time: 4 hours. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Carpool&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;8:45 AM @ Dover CJ Trailways Park &amp;amp; Ride. Take Spaulding Tpk/Rt 16 north to Exit 9 - Left @ light - then Left @ 2nd light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trailhead&lt;/strong&gt;: Follow RT 16 north to RT 171 (~36mi from Dover exit 9). Turn LEFT &amp;amp; follow RT 171 for 14 miles. &lt;span&gt;Ossipee Park Rd&lt;/span&gt; enters on the right about 1.5 mi &lt;span&gt;past&lt;/span&gt; the entrance to Castle in the Clouds. Follow Ossipee Park Rd for 1.5 mi to the parking area just outside the gate. Drive time from Dover is ~65 minutes.&amp;nbsp; We'll be at the trailhead at ~10:15am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food&lt;/strong&gt;: Bring something to eat for the hike but we can also stop at the Poor People's Pub on the way home. It's a very friendly place on RT 109 in Sanbornville that we found after a snowshoe a couple of years ago. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Pets&lt;/strong&gt;: No dogs on this hike, please. &lt;br /&gt;
