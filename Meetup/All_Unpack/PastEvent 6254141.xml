Weerasethakul studied film in Chicago before going back to his native Thailand, where he?s been making feature-length movies since 2000.  He is one of the most exciting young experimental directors working today (and definitely on the short list for greatest name in the whole history of cinema). &lt;br /&gt;Always unpredictable, his movies do not rely on detailed plot or well drawn dramatic characters, but rather build upon mood and atmosphere: Languid, dreamy shots of jungles and highways, long sequences depicting people moving about in their quiet daily lives, exquisite use of Thai pop music? Those are typical elements of his movies. They?re sometimes hard to get into, but once you do, the lyricism and beauty of hat he does hits you right in the face. One thing is for sure: Nobody makes movies like this guy does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Weerasethakul, Syndromes and a Century is &amp;quot;an experiment in re-creation of my parents' lives before I was born.&amp;quot; Here?s the summary form the MFA website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Syndromes and a Century is a film in two parts?often echoing each other?inspired by the filmmaker?s parents in the years before they became lovers. The first part focuses on a woman doctor, set in a time and place reminiscent of the world in which the filmmaker was born and raised. The second part focuses on a male doctor, in a more contemporary environment, similar to the world in which the filmmaker currently lives. Pearls of wisdom and fragments of time crystallize to create a charming, quiet incantation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, Jihad will be holding a meetup sign near the front row (down the stairs, on the right side). We'll then go to a nearby restaurant for lunch and discussion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://72.5.117.145/calendar/event.asp?eventkey=29754&amp;amp;date=9/8/2007" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287534272000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188265170000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Syndromes and a Century</name><id>6254141</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189268100000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6254141/</event_url></item>
