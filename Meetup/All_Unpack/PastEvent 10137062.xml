I've been before and both the food and service were wonderful. I'm not much of an authority on wine but have been told the wine list is excellent. Prices are moderate (check out the website &lt;a href="http://pastacosi.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://pastacosi.com/...&lt;/a&gt; ). I did notice an oversight on the website which lists the address as something other then 1018 Main St, Branford. The restaurants is in fact at the Main St address, right on the town green, across from town hall. Right next door is a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's scoop shop if we're up for a change of scenery after dinner. I really hope you will join us, the group size is limited to 8 people, so please RSVP early and if you must change your plans let us know. I have a hunch that they will probably squeeze a couple more of us in if we need it. Here is my personal email and phone number if you have questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;email - TBrown1948@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Cell -   802-233-9060&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The place is small, look confused - I'll find you, Or ask the hostess.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241388851000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239131237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Out of hibernation get-together</name><id>10137062</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240180200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/10137062/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
