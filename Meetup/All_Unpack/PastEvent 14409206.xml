They have a lovely outside patio too. If its raining we'll be indoors, if not, I'm hoping to hit the patio. We'll play it by ear. Either way, its a great place to go on a summer night AND (fyi) they have jazz on the roof on Fridays! The drinks and appetizers are good too, check out their HH specials on the website, and let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing some kind of scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
