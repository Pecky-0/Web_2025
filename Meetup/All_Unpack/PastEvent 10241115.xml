History gives you a customer profile, the advertising venues that are most successful, and the response rates you should expect.  Without history – how does one market a brand new company, division, or product?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come learn the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 Truths to Marketing a New Venture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; from a professional who has been involved in sales and marketing for a variety of start-ups since 1990.  Currently, Katie Donovan is the Business Development Manager for &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sempoinstitute.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SEMPO Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, a non-profit provider of search engine marketing courses.  Ms. Donovan joined SEMPO Institute two months after the release of its first course in March 2007.  In the 2 years since, SEMPO Institute has grown to have 2000 students enrolled in its courses.  Her marketing initiatives consistently provide above average results – regardless of the marketing/advertising venue.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;During this session learn about digital marketing, partnerships, marketing message, target clients and other aspects of marketing to help ensure the success of your new venture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;RSVP for this FREE MEETING!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lower Level in the Community Room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick Stamoulis</member_name><member_id>3606214</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250725450000</updated><rating><average>4.21999979019</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Marketing Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Marketing-Learning-Group</urlname><id>1338478</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Marketing Learning Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>43</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240396243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Marketing New Ventures by Katie Donovan of the SEMPO Institute</name><id>10241115</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248303600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Marketing-Learning-Group/events/10241115/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/0/global_8190880.jpeg</photo_url></item>
