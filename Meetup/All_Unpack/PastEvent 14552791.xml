We are planning on 15 people but can accommodate 30 if there are enough participants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More on the meal and the location later....if you weren't at the tasting event ask those who were how amazingly good everything is at Cavos.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one that looks like me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289174860000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282850359000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cavos - Great Big Greek Dinner</name><id>14552791</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286748000000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/14552791/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/7/global_17481431.jpeg</photo_url></item>
