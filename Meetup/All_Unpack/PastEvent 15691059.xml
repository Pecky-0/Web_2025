I wanted to schedule a meetup for this so that we can all go together. It is very funny, and I am positive everyone will have a great time! If you have never seen improv before, then you should definitely attend. I've been to both Improv Boston in Central Square and Improv Asylum in North end, and I liked Improv Asylum better. Here s the link for their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.improvasylum.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.improvasyl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BUY YOUR OWN TICKET!!  It can be bought online. Buy the Main Show's ticket, for December 17th at 8PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to watch the show, and then we can grab drinks later. If anyone knows a good bar around, then let me know! We will meet outside (or inside if its too cold!) the Improv Asylum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easily accessible from the T (green line to Gov't center). It should be a great meetup!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet outside the venue.
