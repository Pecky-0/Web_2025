The New York Film critics named it Best Picture of the Year, Rafelson as Best Director and Karen Black as Best Supporting Actress. As Robert Dupea (&amp;quot;One of the most unforgettable characters in American movies.&amp;quot; - Ebert), Jack Nicholson delivers a career-defining performance, embodying the tortured disillusionment with his suffocating family, his neglected talent as a piano prodigy, and his aimless life on the road working oil rigs. With his father terminally ill, he embarks on a trip back home but reconciliation eludes him. Tammy Wynette provided five songs for the film's soundtrack, including her hit &amp;quot;Stand by Your Man.&amp;quot; Alongside Nicholson, the film boasts powerful performances by Karen Black, Susan Anspach, Ralph Waite and Sally Struthers. Newly restored, FIVE EASY PIECES remains every bit as relevant and remarkable as it was 40 years ago. &amp;quot;A striking movie... eloquent, important, written and improvised in a clear-hearted American idiom&amp;quot; - Pauline Kael NOMINATED FOR FOUR ACADEMY AWARDS, INCLUDING BEST PICTURE AND BEST ACTOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;98 min&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be on the bench outside.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274757715000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272717675000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Five Easy Pieces (40th Anniversary)</name><id>13348085</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274743800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/13348085/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
