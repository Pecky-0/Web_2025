Our topic, The Passion of the Atheist, came up regarding a blog by atheist Greta Christina, about atheists and anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2007/10/atheists-and-an.html#comment-captcha" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2007/10/atheists-and-an.html#comment-captcha" target="_blank"&gt;http://gretachristina...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atheists will enjoy reading her blog (caution: it does contain strong language), which offers a litany of reasons why atheists are atheists, and why Greta Christina, in particular, is angry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a point of discussion for this meeting, we will broach whether anger is useful/necessary as a tool for social change/acceptance, as it has been used in other social movements. Are you a passionate or passive atheist? We will explore how we define our roles as participants (or as non-participants) in atheism as a social-change movement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also continue our discussion about outreach efforts, including a &amp;quot;Coming out of the Closet&amp;quot; meeting idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lending Library: many members have books relevant to atheism to share, and at the last Wednesday night meeting the group began collaborating on a lending library of sorts.  Bring a list of books you have to share (or email it to the group in advance) and perhaps you could bring several select books to lend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the large group, some might be wearing atheistic shirts</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul S</member_name><member_id>4811434</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie </member_name><member_id>7248057</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263915628000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261863148000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Morning Topical Meeting--The Passion of the Atheist</name><id>12149459</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263742200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/12149459/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/2/global_10991506.jpeg</photo_url></item>
