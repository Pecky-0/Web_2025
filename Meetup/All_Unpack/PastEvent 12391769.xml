Raymond Turnelle ( a local Barrington resident) has a lifetime of adventures documented on slides and presents slide shows to various groups.  He will be coming to the Foster Climbing Barn to present &amp;quot;Climbing without a Summit&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Failure to finish a climb can be attributed to several factors.  Yet knowing that every effort was made to achieve the goal can be satisfying and well worth the attempt&amp;quot;, Says Raymond.  I like to teach this to new climbers as well.  Climbing is a personal sport, you put in your best effort and be proud that you did, even if it means you didn't reach the top that day.  &lt;br /&gt;I'm interested and excited to see the show!  Come around 6:30 the show is at 7pm.  Feel free to bring snacks, drinks, etc.  Raymond is kind to do this for free, so the event is free to all ages!  He has several shows so if this works out I will set up others for us!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kellie Barr-Foster</member_name><member_id>6992283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266192995000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264170574000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Summit Productions Slide show series</name><id>12391769</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265844600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/12391769/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/global_8592199.jpeg</photo_url></item>
