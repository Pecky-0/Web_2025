(Whoa, dude... )&lt;br /&gt;The paper is posted in the &amp;quot;Files&amp;quot; section of the site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal take on the paper is that their point is not as hopelessly goofy as it sounds at first reading, but is actually a fairly straight-forward result of taking Bohr and von Neumann's interpretations of QM seriously. That being said, I'm not sure if I think their arguments really work in the end, but it's very good read in any case.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll prepare a few PP slides to present summarizing the paper that we can then rip apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP, let me know if you're up for pizza again like last time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;Sean&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sean Lee</member_name><member_id>2978255</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212441075000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>philosophy-185</urlname><id>331299</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy of Mind Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210345244000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Whoa-Dude: It's Quantum Psychology!</name><id>7905971</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212102000000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/philosophy-185/events/7905971/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/4/global_678996.jpeg</photo_url></item>
