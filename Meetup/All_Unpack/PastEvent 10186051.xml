The charity that was decided on via a poll is &lt;a href="http://doctorswithoutborders.org" target="_blank"&gt;Doctors Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; which is a charity that brings &amp;quot;aid to people whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe, primarily due to armed conflict, epidemics, malnutrition, exclusion from health care, or natural disasters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;MSF's work is based on the humanitarian principles of medical ethics and impartiality. The organization is committed to bringing quality medical care to people caught in crisis regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation.&amp;quot; - From their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost per person is at mininum $25, of which about 50% will go to the designated charity, however you can also opt to donate more. Members who aren't able to attend are invited to make direct donations of $10 or more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer Zachary Bos will be sending a personal check on behalf of the group, so donations need to be given to him. Members can pay with a check or cash in person, or send donations via PayPal to zakbos@bu.edu.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242243851000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239750245000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charity Event: Bowling Without Borders</name><id>10186051</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241737200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/10186051/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/f/5/global_5813621.jpeg</photo_url></item>
