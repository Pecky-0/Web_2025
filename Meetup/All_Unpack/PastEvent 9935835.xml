<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Lets Hike with the Kids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a kid friendly hike, &lt;b&gt;Rob&lt;/b&gt; will be there leading with his 2 boys age 3 and 7 so he wants this to be fun for the youngsters.  Chatfield Hollow offers great easy trails, fun boulders to climb on and Indian Caves to explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids may be lucky enough to see an arrowhead left from the many native Americans that used to inhabit this area.  It’s unlikely though, that they will come across any signs of the witches said to have lived in the area.  Legends tell of two mischievous witches. “Goody Wee” and “Betty Wee,” who lived in the hollow and enjoyed playing tricks on their neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ll meet at 10 AM at the parking area in Chatfield Hollow State Park just inside the park entrance (see park hiking map below). There should also be parking for 6 cars on the south side of Rte. 80 at a trailhead a little ways to the west from the entrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have a picnic lunch either at the pavilion or one of the many picnic tables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you should bring:&lt;br /&gt;• Gloves -some cold, may need hands for climbing&lt;br /&gt;• Wear layers -for warmth (avoid cotton material)&lt;br /&gt;• Warm hat&lt;br /&gt;• Waterproof and warm boots&lt;br /&gt;• Quart or two of water&lt;br /&gt;• Some trail food/lunch&lt;br /&gt;• Daypack -to carry stuff&lt;br /&gt;• Maybe some bread to feed the ducks in the pond&lt;br /&gt;• Some chance for ice in spots so you may want to bring traction footgear like YackTracks or MICROspikes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;From Route 9: take Exit 9. Follow Route 81 south to Route 80 west and watch for park entrance signs.&lt;br /&gt;From I-95: take Exit 63. Follow Route 81 north to Route 80 west.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Killingworth&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;cat=Chatfield+Hollow+State+Park#a/search/l:::Killingworth:CT::US:41.358101:-72.564201:city:Middlesex+County:1/m::16:41.361368:-72.580228:0:::::/so:Chatfield+Hollow+State+Park:::r::25:::::/e" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(approximate lat=41.365, long=-72.5845)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partial hiking map (shows only park trails and north end of Chatfield Trail at Rte. 80) and directions can be found at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325182" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chatfield Trail map can be found on page 87 in the current 19th ed. &amp;quot;Connecticut Walk Book East&amp;quot; by the Connecticute Forest and Parks Association.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs on the hike?:&lt;br /&gt;Dogs on a leash are permitted.
