Enjoy the flavors of the islands and then sit back and relax as we explore the fantasy of a tropical isle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to The Hu Ke Lau Restaurant and Dinner Theater for a fabulous dinner and their infamous Hawaiian Luau show. For years this show has received the highest ratings...come see what it is all about. Sit back, relax and close your eyes...you can almost feel the light, tropical breezes as they caress your face...hear the drums ...follow the dancers every movement as they perform for you. WOW!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entertainment of &lt;strong&gt;Hu Ke Lau&lt;/strong&gt; is second to none in the area. Beautiful dancers, soothing music and colorful costumes contrast with the exciting fire dance of Samoa, rhythmic drums of the Fuji War Dance and graceful Hawaiian Hula...will both relax and excite you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theater has&amp;nbsp;one of the finest floorshows in New England with&amp;nbsp;their very own cast&amp;nbsp;in a 90-minute show that changes seasonally. Parts of&amp;nbsp;the floorshow offer the opportunity for members of&amp;nbsp;the audience to star with them.&amp;nbsp;This is the only tropical show of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sign up now...only 30 minutes from Hartford. Sail away with us...&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Terri or Chuck or the Meetup sign...Cell is 203-808-5829</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>chuck</member_name><member_id>11483387</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304300274000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><why>We love dinner shows!</why><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1301681161000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ALOHA...Hawaiian Drums are Beating at The Hu Ke Lau!</name><id>17145141</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304199000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/17145141/</event_url></item>
