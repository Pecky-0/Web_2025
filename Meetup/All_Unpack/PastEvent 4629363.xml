Now I predict that May will be even better. Ron ranere was a fabulous host at his photography studio. And Ron said he'll do it again for May!!!&lt;br /&gt;     We started many great solutions for success in our difficult industry, and by May, we expect that these solutions will be structured as a foundation for us. &lt;br /&gt;     Please come and help us &amp;amp; you succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venue is again at Ron Ranere's &amp;quot;Positive Image&amp;quot; photography studio. A great place, and a great host.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.shirleywillett.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shirleywillett.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.shirleywil...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1114124946000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Fashion Industry May Meetup</name><id>4629363</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1116540000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/4629363/</event_url></item>
