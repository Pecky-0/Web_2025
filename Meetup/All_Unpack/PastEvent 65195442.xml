Gotham Rocks, New York Cityâ€™s top rock and metal talent promoter, has announced its first ever tour this June 2012. The tour will span 10 states, headlined by the explosive EYE EMPIRE. Direct support for this top rock band are Gotham Rocks veterans CHARETTA and GHOSTS OF EDEN from NYC, accompanied by Chicopee natives NOSHO. &lt;br /&gt;

The June 2012 tour is in conjunction with the Gotham Rocks 2011 talent search showcase, through which, teamed with Reverbnation, Gotham Rocks will select bands for each show, auditioning those selected in their respective city to play for an industry and sponsorship showcase in New York City this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
