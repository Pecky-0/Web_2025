What a nice day it was outside, hopefully our November meetup will have such luck!  Come join us for another fun Saturday afternoon for the dogs.  I am concerned with what the weather will be like in mid November, but don't worry - there is a huge inside room that we can use if it is too cold outside.  Any friendly dog is welcome, so tell your friends too!  We hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195495678000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192135709000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November Meetup!</name><id>6532163</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195322400000</time><rsvp_limit>100</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/6532163/</event_url></item>
