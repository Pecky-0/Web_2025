We weren't going to meet but, since this is my last month as facilitator, I wanted to suggest one of my all time favorite books as a parting gift.  I promise that you will never forget Owen and you'll thank me for the suggestion to read it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the meeting is happening one week earlier than usual as many people will be away the last week of the month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We read &amp;quot;The Scent of Rain and Lightning&amp;quot; by Nancy Pickard and I will admit that it was roundly panned.  Even I didn't like it and I recommended it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy all the season has in store for you.  Find time to curl up with a good book and, hopefully, we'll all meet in December at Bruegger's.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elaine    </member_name><member_id>7294680</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294019410000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291139160000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Brookline Book Club</name><id>15596405</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292792400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/15596405/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/5/9/global_12779209.jpeg</photo_url></item>
