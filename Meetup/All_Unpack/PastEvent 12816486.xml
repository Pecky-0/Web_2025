Created in the early 1900s by artist and suffragist Blanche Ames and her botanist husband Oakes, Borderland offers many of the same pleasures that the Ames family enjoyed: walking and horseback riding on woodland trails, fishing and canoeing in the ponds, or, in winter, ice-skating and sledding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little advance planning, you can make your visit to Borderland more enjoyable. The park is open daily year round from 8am to sunset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Lawrence Newcomb Visitors Center please stop in the entryway for more information. There are no restaurants or stores within three miles of the park entrance; you may wish to bring a picnic lunch. There are restrooms, a water bubbler and a drink machine at the Visitors Center. Printed trail maps are available at the Center, and on weekends and summer months the main room is open, providing information about the Ames family, as well as special exhibits. The address of the Visitors Center is 259 Massapoag Avenue, North Easton, MA 02356; phone 508-238-6566.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a $2 per car parking fee payable self-service yellow machine at the main entrance. The receipt to be put on the dashboard is good for the day. Annual ParksPass and senior passes are also available at the Visitor Center when staff is on duty; mail-in applications can be picked up from outside the main door when no staff are present. There is no camping at Borderland; the nearest state campgrounds to Borderland are Massasoit State Park, 15 miles away, and Myles Standish State Forest.  Please: no dogs off leash, fires, alcoholic beverages, hunting or motorized vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mansion Tours are offered by The Friends of Borderland on the third Sunday of the month between April and November, from 1pm to 3pm, at a cost of $3 for adults (please call the park to check tour hours). Group tours are available on weekdays by appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camping, canoeing and swimming are available nearby at Massasoit State Park&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269961459000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268062978000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BORDERLAND STATE PARK . </name><id>12816486</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269788400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/12816486/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/3/global_7785619.jpeg</photo_url></item>
