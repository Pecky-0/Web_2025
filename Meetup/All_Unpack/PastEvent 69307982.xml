They should know by midday if a movie will not be presented. The Free summer movie series at MIT is also starting up. Tonight and tomorrow night, Friday, 6/15 and Sat. 6/16, at 8:00 both nights, "Dr. Seuss' The Lorax" will be shown in room 26-100. Free admission. The easiest way to get there is to take the #1 or #66 bus in front of the closed Best Buy store next to the Hynes MBTA Green Line station on the corner of Boylston and Newbury Streets. Get off at 77 Massachusetts Avenue. It's the grand entrance to MIT, just over the bridge, with several pillars in front of the building. Walk into the entrance and straight through the corridor (the 'infinite corridor') all the way to the other side. Just as you're about to walk out the exit, take a left and walk down the stairs. You'll then be walking left. Keep going in that direction (don't take the next right) and you'll pass under a sign which reads, "Building 26 Vassar Street." The auditorium is right there. You'll see the display case advertising the current movie on the wall between the two doors. Ask a student if you can't find it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345255691000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339771966000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Catch a Free Friday Flick outside :) Puss in Boots!</name><id>69307982</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345244400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/69307982/</event_url></item>
