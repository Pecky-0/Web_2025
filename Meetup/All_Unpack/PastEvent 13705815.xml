On June 13th, 2010, 25 teams will compete for the bragging rights of making the state’s best kosher chili.  We are expecting over 300 people to attend an afternoon of food, fun, &amp;amp; camaraderie, all under the same festive tents. Live entertainment, activities for families, a beer garden and delicious chili, are just a few of the exciting highlights of the day! Proceeds from the profits will benefit the Jewish Community Center of Rhode Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is $10 for entry into the event, tasting of chili, live entertainment, beer garden, bounce house, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning to get there early to make sure to sample as widely as possible.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet across the street at the corner of Sessions and Elmgrove, closest to the stadium.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276552066000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275745784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Kosher Chili Cookoff</name><id>13705815</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276486200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/13705815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
