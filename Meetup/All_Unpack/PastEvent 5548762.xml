<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A winter hike on the Appalachian Trail starting south of Dalton, MA and heading northbound for about 4 miles. We'll be finishing up the segment of the AT not completed on the last trip in February. We'll do a couple miles of AT trail from Grange Hall Rd., up over the short Day Mtn. (approx 300 ft. elevation gain), and down into Dalton (approx. 500 ft. elevation loss). Then a couple miles of AT trail through the small city streets of Dalton to the AT parking lot on Gulf Rd. north of Dalton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet up at 12:30 PM at the small AT parking lot just north of Dalton, MA on Gulf Rd. (see below). Then we'll head to the starting point on Grange Hall Rd. (see below) via shuttle by my van (up to 6 people) and arrive at about 12:40 PM. As there is no parking there I'll have to park the van some distance away and return in about 20 min. to start the hike at 1 PM. The hike will complete at the Gulf Rd. AT parking lot at about 4 PM at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**3/8/07 in PM -Current weather prediction has improved! High at time of hike 40-44 F, winds 15 mph, ONLY 10% chance of rain (i.e. not likely)! NOTE: There is a good chance of at least 12&amp;quot; of old and wet snow on the ground to hike through on Day Mtn. so plan accordingly.**&lt;br /&gt;** 3/8/07 in AM -Weather prediction: High at time of hike of 44 F, winds 15 mph, 30% chance of a few rain showers.**&lt;br /&gt;** Given the late notice of this AT &amp;quot;filler&amp;quot; hike, please give me a call on my cell at (860) 836-3400 if you RSVP later than Friday night at 10 PM, 3/9/06, so that I may plan accordingly.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go need to have:&lt;br /&gt;* A day pack -to carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail snack and water.&lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed warm hiking boots or comfortable winter boots -There will be snow so it will be wet and cold!&lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks -to keep those feet warm even if wet.&lt;br /&gt;* Gators (or snow pants) -Strongly encouraged as there will be snow on the trail and you want to keep it out of your boots!&lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing -avoid cotton as it stays wet/cold. Don't forget your legs can get cold too.&lt;br /&gt;* Gloves -MUST have &amp;amp; warm ones too!&lt;br /&gt;* Jacket -Good for potential rain and say 30 F temps. but also can stow in pack if you get too hot.&lt;br /&gt;* Hat -you loose 20% of your heat through your head! Protect those ears too.&lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water&lt;br /&gt;* Trail appropriate snack (e.g. at least G.O.R.P -Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, beef jerky, granola bars, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;* Snowshoes -Optional. There might still be a lot of snow on the trail and the going would be easier with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jacket shouldn't be too heavy as other layers of clothing should add to your insulation to keep warm and layers would be added or removed as needed. While hiking you WILL be hot. It will be a rather warm day but there is a chance of a cold rain shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this event is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so all questions should be directed to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions to the AT meetup point/ending point, north of Dalton, MA via MapQuest:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;addtohistory=&amp;amp;address=%5b2%2d28%5d%20Gulf%20Rd&amp;amp;city=Dalton&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;zipcode=01226&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;location=ZwuDGaRIb%2bhNQTDePwIoBvOffdJrnMiDogFD%2fYlROL7wHxsAqAERgxuhNyGakPBO4XrUT6SFTtiHdOBjyvXF821%2fuF%2fF5PDs52J8YwVMm5R16LM72HR6FQ%3d%3d&amp;amp;ambiguity=1"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions to the AT trailhead starting point (no parking), in on Grange Hall Rd. south of Dalton, MA via MapQuest:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;latitude=&amp;amp;longitude=&amp;amp;name=&amp;amp;phone=&amp;amp;level=&amp;amp;addtohistory=&amp;amp;cat=&amp;amp;address=610+Grange+Hall+Rd&amp;amp;city=Dalton&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;zipcode=01226"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179837021000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173359176000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Hike on the AT South of Dalton, MA</name><id>5548762</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1173547800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5548762/</event_url></item>
