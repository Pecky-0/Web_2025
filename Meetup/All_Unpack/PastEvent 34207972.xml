Obviously a meetup there would involve getting tickets together etc.. So this is a show of interest suggestion. If we get 4-8 folks, I'll pull the trigger on tickets (if available). I think we should get a show of interest by this Friday at noon and go from there. I have the day off and will be on campus later that day for a movie and could look into tickets at that time. So RSVP if interested. Day hikes should be over by then. This will provide a great opp to stiffen those muscles up (if the drive hadn't already)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317836124000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316485605000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Night Football: Dartmouth vs. Penn, Sat 6pm</name><id>34207972</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317506400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/34207972/</event_url></item>
