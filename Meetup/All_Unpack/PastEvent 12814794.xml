Indian! I was less than thrilled. I LOVE Indian food, but not Indian RESTAURANT food.  It can't compare with authentic home-cooked Indian food and almost all Indian restaurants seem to have the same menu. Boring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it occurred to me that Indian-INFLUENCED food is an entirely different kettle of fish. And I remembered that I have wanted to try the food at Mantra for a very long time. It combines exotic Indian spices with classic French cooking technique and New England-sourced ingredients. It also claims to be the only French-Indian restaurant in New England, not to mention &amp;quot;one of the most significant interior spaces in Boston in more than a decade,&amp;quot; according to the Globe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we now have a reservation during Restaurant Week, and will be able to sample the special 3-course menu they are featuring for $33.10. Or sample any of the other delights available there, which include some very creative cocktails, a &amp;quot;naan bar,&amp;quot; and a hookah room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you are as excited and intrigued as I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminder: If this is your first meetup with our group, you must pay a reservation fee in order to reserve your spot. Don't worry, you'll get it back, sort of . . . I will add it into the tax-and-tip part of the bill for our table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be in Iris's name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271174126000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268030694000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Restaurant Week Dinner at Mantra, Boston</name><id>12814794</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269556200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/12814794/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/4/global_13528212.jpeg</photo_url></item>
