Come check out Ben, Lisa, Sandy, Robin, and myself from the Incubator on stage in our troupe.  We'll be opening up things at Improv Boston night.  Bring some friends, have fun, and yell out some good stuff for us to use.  All the details below, the best part is there's an open improv session following all the acts which means you get to share the stage with all of us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howdy partner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole Lost Marbles gang invites you to come on down to Sgt. Culpepper's Comedy Jamboree at ImprovBoston this Sunday, October 12th from 7pm -9pm to see some quick wit as we lasso y'all into our improv saloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be opening up the night by firing off some great short form improv games in the vein of &amp;quot;Who's Line is It Anyway.&amp;quot; The best part is you will be in control as we rely on you the audience members for suggestions for our onstage antics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of that as an optional part of the evening, if you'd like to take a crack at dispensing laughter, all of you will be invited on stage at the end of the night to take part in some simple improv games. No experience required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $10 / $7 for students and seniors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invite your friends and have some fun before the work week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you all there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>This just in!!!
