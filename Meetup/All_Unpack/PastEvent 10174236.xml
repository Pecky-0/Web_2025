After the walk we'll have lunch at a nearby restaurant.  Mount Auburn Cemetery is one of the most beautiful and historic landscapes in America. Its impressive collection of over 5,000 trees represents 630 taxa. Thousands of shrubs and herbaceous plants weave through 175 acres of hills, dells, ponds, woodlands and clearings. The landscape reflects different styles ranging from Victorian-era plantings to contemporary gardens, from natural woodlands to formal ornamental gardens, and from sweeping vistas through majestic trees to small enclosed spaces. The Cemetery is widely known for its meticulous maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant species from around the world that grow in a northern temperate climate can be seen on the grounds, including individual specimens recorded as Massachusetts state or New England champions of their species. Display labels with scientific and common names are found on many trees and on shrubs and herbaceous plants in some special landscaped areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain cancels&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241363735000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239633560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CHESTNUT HILL WALKING MEETUP-MT AUBURN CEMETERY</name><id>10174236</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240153200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/10174236/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/3/global_7785619.jpeg</photo_url></item>
