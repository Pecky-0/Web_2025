Enjoy live music outside in the Calderwood Courtyard, and get to see the museum as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will meet in the courtyard at 6:00, listen to the music for a while, then those who are interested can take a tour of the museum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a public venue will open up the limit on number of people who can attend.  Will ask that if you can not attend to please update your profile to no. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am changing the time to 6:15 as when I spoke to the museum today they told me there might be a line to get it.  This should give everyone time to get in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Note: Rain will cancel this event&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>will meet in the courtyard near the bookstore.
