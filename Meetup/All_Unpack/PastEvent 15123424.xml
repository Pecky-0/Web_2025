Its exposed rocky summit provides excellent views of the surrounding area.  Most of the bright fall colors will likely be gone but the views will still be awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't hiked on these trails or climbed to this summit in a couple of years and did all of my current research using the AMC's &lt;i&gt;White Mountain Guide&lt;/i&gt;, a trail map, and the Internet. The link below provides an overview of where we will be going and includes a topographic map of the area. You should become familiar with this information since you are ultimately responsible for your own safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=7005" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more information about this peak from Peakbagger.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you plan to participate in this event you must answer the questions for both you and any guests when you RSVP YES or MAYBE - if you don't answer them your RSVP will be removed without notice by the organizer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling is encouraged - indicate in your RSVP if you need a ride or can give one.  You are responsible for making your own arrangements so you should check back often and contact others who might want/need to carpool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP up-to-date - if your plans change please be considerate and update your RSVP as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have a confirmed ride when you RSVP I would ask that you RSVP MAYBE until you have one - once you have a confirmed ride you can then change your RSVP to YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All MAYBE RSVPs will be changed to NO three days before the event so people who might be on the WAITING LIST have an opportunity to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are welcome on this hike provided they are under voice control, you bring a leash in case you need to use it, and you bring a copy of their most recent rabies vaccination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trip Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will follow the Champney Falls and Piper Trails from the parking area to the summit and then follow the same route in reverse to return.  &lt;b&gt;On this moderate pace trip we will hike about 7.8 miles and climb about 2,500 feet. It is considered INTERMEDIATE because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the objective of this trip is to enjoy ourselves as we climb as a group, your safety, and the safety of the others in the group, is the most important thing. If you underestimate the demands of this trip, or overestimate your skills and abilities, you may put yourself and/or others at risk - consider this before you decide if you are going to participate.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker in the group. If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you. Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you.         &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ANY questions about your ability to participate in and complete this entire trip please contact me.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Reaching the summit is optional, getting down is mandatory.&amp;quot;   &lt;br /&gt;(Ed Viesturs on the dangers of mountaineering)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous weather conditions will cancel this hike - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Groveton&amp;amp;state=NH&amp;amp;site=GYX&amp;amp;lat=44.5992&amp;amp;lon=-71.5182" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for the current weather forecast for this trip.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it might be warm at the trailhead it could be colder with more wind at the summit - on average it is 3-5 degrees colder for every 1,000 feet of elevation gained along the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing and Equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a list describing the minimum clothing and equipment required to participate in this event. DO NOT rely on others to have extra clothing or equipment to share with you once we are out on the trails.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Footwear: Hiking boots or trail shoes.  &lt;u&gt;Since it is getting cold the exposed ledge may be slippery so you should also have some form of light traction (e.g. MICROspikes).&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clothing: Dress in layers to easily regulate body temperature. Wear synthetic shirt/pants and bring a fleece jacket/wool sweater - ABSOLUTELY NO COTTON.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outerwear: Waterproof/windproof rain jacket with hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food and Water: High-energy snacks, food for lunch, and at least three quarts of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other Essential Gear: Map and compass. Plastic whistle. Headlamp with two sets of spare batteries. An emergency space blanket (e.g. mylar). Small pocket knife or multi-purpose tool. Toilet kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items). Sunscreen. Lip balm. Sunglasses. Insect repellent. Waterproof cover for your pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optional Items: Waterproof/windproof pants. Waterproof gaiters. Trekking poles. Camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it &lt;u&gt;prior&lt;/u&gt; to this trip.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I will bring a group first aid kit that contains basic items I am not certified or trained in wilderness first aid. You will need to bring any medications or medical supplies that you may need during the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin this hike at 9:00 AM from the Champney Falls Trail parking area located in Groveton, NH. According to Google Maps this meeting spot is about 156 miles from Boston and it should take about 2 hours 49 minutes to drive there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://local.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Boston,+MA&amp;amp;daddr=43.989904,-71.299104(Champney+Falls+Trailhead)&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=FZ9WhgIdw7bD-ykbMT0NLWXjiTGg6GIBJL98eA%3BFZA7nwId4A_A-w&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;sll=43.984694,-71.293781&amp;amp;sspn=0.010406,0.019205&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=8" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for driving directions to the meeting spot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Blair</member_name><member_id>3942422</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Monica Trust</member_name><member_id>4555776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1288037370000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287180553000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chocorua in Fall (Intermediate Hike)</name><id>15123424</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287838800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/15123424/</event_url></item>
