Join us for a fun and practical FREE seminar with Sproutman Steve Meyerowitz. Steve will demonstrate how he easily grows pounds of fresh organic mini-produce in his kitchen every week and all year-round. No soil, no bugs, no big investments, and no green thumb necessary. Steve says, &amp;quot;It's easy, it's fun, it saves money, it's chemical-free, and it's healthier than much of the produce you are spending top $$ for.&amp;quot; Steve is one of the world's leading proponents of sprouting, juicing, fasting, wheatgrass, indoor gardening, and pure water. He was christened &amp;quot;Sproutman&amp;quot; in the 1970's because of his passion for sprouts and indoor gardening and the nutritious, organic foods they provide. Steve chose the topic &amp;#147;Kitchen Gardening&amp;#148; because it&amp;#146;s the best way to have fresh organic home grown greens in January. $10.50 Vegan Buffet Dinner to follow (optional). This is a Monthly Educational Seminar with the Boston Vegetarian Society (BVS) and Boston Vegan and Vegetarian Meetup Groups.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327193096000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323147488000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kitchen Gardening FREE Seminar with Sproutman Steve Meyerowitz</name><id>43533992</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326657600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/43533992/</event_url></item>
