<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! It is amazing to me that 2012 is almost gone! The time of fun and stress are upon us. Remember....some nice slow deap breathing works wonders for stress. &lt;br /&gt;

Holiday extravaganza potluck!! Wear your best or worst holiday sweater :). We will be having a yankee swap ($10 max)! participation totally not mandatory! If you have party plans stop by to have a good dinner before heading out. Please bring a raw organic dish enough for 6-8 people. If you are new and not sure what to bring a salad (fruit or veggie) is always good. If I don't get to see you I would like to wish you very Fun Holidays and a Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354989409000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1354028034000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dec 7 Holiday Extravaganza!!</name><id>93002862</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354923000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/93002862/</event_url></item>
