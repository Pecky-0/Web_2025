<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Its Mother's Day. Hiker's choice for those who want to hike. AND my family has said to hike if I wish.....hmmmm I can be persuaded if there are other interested hikers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP if your available and suggest a trail. I will help with the details. Meetup time and location will be updated.  I posted a 10 AM start so we can sleep in a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is on my idea list.  No long drives unless your driving this Mom......So, Monadnock or Pack Monadnock, Would that make it MOMadnock? Ridesharing is fun and means you can hike more often. Post your carpool options in your comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ascutney or other Dartmouth region hikes, Cardigan. Lets get this organized so we can all RSVP. Tell your kids to call you later in the day so you can hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet there are some great places we can end up at for our Mom's Day &amp;quot;brunch&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://bestsmileys.com/weather/3.gif" border="0" alt='' /&gt; Fowl weather like this cancels.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210693849000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209588417000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mother's Day Hikers Choice! </name><id>7845009</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210520700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/7845009/</event_url></item>
