<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Last time I was at Pandemonium but for another meetup for the Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston (e.g. the non-D&amp;amp;D crowd) and meet one member briefly who was looking for others, so it doesn't appear there was a huge turn out. And the previous month I believe I was pretty lonely myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly can make an attempt, to come next month again, but I'm not sure how much people get out of this automatically schedule meetup every month. Is Pandemonium the best place and is there a better format that people would prefer. I guess I'm asking for suggestion and feedback to make this a better use of everyones time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian&lt;br /&gt;Your friendly&lt;br /&gt;Organizer &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christian Loidl</member_name><member_id>1035154</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jay</member_name><member_id>1685722</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Angelia</member_name><member_id>3168774</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan J</member_name><member_id>10199663</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292091995000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852216000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>ccfdnynqbpb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292086800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/14753043/</event_url></item>
