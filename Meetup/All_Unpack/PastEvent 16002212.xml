We will be dancing cha cha and rumba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 people minimum required otherwise we will cancel. Please bring EXACT CASH payment and arrive 10-15 minutes early so we can get in a full hour of dancing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have previously attended, please note the time change.  We are trying this earlier to see if we can avoid some of the Friday night parking issues.  Also for those who have requested a series of lessons, we will probably start a weekly class in February if there is enough interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear leather soled shoes (rubber soles too hard to turn in) and for the women- heels if you prefer. If the weather outside is crummy please wear a different pair of shoes and change when you get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Studio is hard to find. The address is Cottage Ave but you cannot see it from Cottage Ave. If you are facing the front door of The Fours, there is an alley to the left. The Studio entrance is in the alley. The sign above the door says &amp;quot;Danceworks&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristin</member_name><member_id>8257788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295723244000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294712299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ballroom Dance</name><id>16002212</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295654400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/16002212/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/4/global_17172772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
