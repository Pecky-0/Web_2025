We'll do everything from going to the movies, reading books, going out to dinner, skiing, taking a walk, or trying a new adventure! Plus, we're always up for new ideas!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group is especially designed if you would like to make new friends or just plain old get out and have some fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you new to the area? Do you just need to meet some new friends because life is constantly changing? Do you need to expand your horizons? Then this group is for you! Everyone is welcome, married, single, male or female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please be respectful of other members. If you don't have anything nice to say, please don't say anything at all. Unkindness will NOT be tolerated in this group. We aim to make everyone feel welcome!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
