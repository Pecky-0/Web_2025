There is a sign on route 11. Trailhead is on the back right side of the parking lot if you are facing the mountain. There is a small trail on the left back side of the parking lot but this is not the trail for Mt Major. (Lat:43.50396 Lon:-71.29729) We will be hiking up Mt. Major via the main trail. This trail is 2.4 miles long one way and should take us approximately 1:30 to reach the summit. Upon reaching the summit we can make a decision as a group on whether or not to take the Major/Straightback link over to Straightback mountain. This would add approximately an additional 3 miles round trip to the hike. Therefore total distance would be approximately 7.8 miles and should take approximately 6 hours to accomplish. In my opinion, Mt. Major offers some of the best views for a minimum smount of hiking. Even though this is a relatively low elevation mountain, expect to encounter cold weather conditions. Dress appropriately!! Snowshoes are generally not required, since this is a often used trail. Foot traction devices are generally not required, but are strongly encouraged in case icey conditions are encountered.
