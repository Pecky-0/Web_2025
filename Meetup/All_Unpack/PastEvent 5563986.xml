I think this topic will lend itself to great post-film discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this film (as well as the other films at BUFF) is an amazingly low $5, especially considering the fact that this is the New England premiere and the film's director is hosting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is being hosted by Nicole, your friendly meetup assistant organizer. As always, I'll be standing at the front of the theater, meetup sign in hand, so we can go eat and discuss the film at a local restaurant (probably Yenching).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film's description is below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW ENGLAND PREMIERE!&lt;br /&gt;HOSTED BY DIRECTOR MELODY GILBERT&lt;br /&gt;URBAN EXPLORERS: INTO THE DARKNESS&lt;br /&gt;Director: Melody Gilbert&lt;br /&gt;USA, 2007, 85 min., Video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admit it. You've always wanted to check out some of the abandoned tunnels in the T. You can do so vicariously through the interesting folks who actually do this kind of stuff in Melody Gilbert's fascinating documentary Urban Explorers: Into the Darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than merely interview some real-life urban explorers, Gilbert actually tags along with them on their frequently dangerous missions; capturing their finds and exploits as they struggle to get in and out of their cavernous playgrounds, such as underground tunnels, abandoned mental hospitals and even Xanadu (the futuristic &amp;quot;dream house&amp;quot; formerly en route to Disney World in Orlando). The goal of urban exploration is merely to satisfy curiosity and provide adventure. These people are not there to steal, tag or sabotage any ground they cover. Ideally, the only sign that they had ever been there should be the photos they took and their footprints. But that does not stop them from being labeled as terrorists, as law enforcement makes the stakes higher for an already dangerous past-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Urban Explorers not only delves into the lives of the people who make this their hobby, but provides interesting insight to the history of civilization's infrastructure. After seeing this film, you may even feel tempted to do some exploring of your own: there's always the old Harvard/Brattle red line station, closed in 1981, right under your feet, but we're not suggesting you actually check it out?that would be irresponsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.urbanexplorersfilm.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preceded by&lt;br /&gt;THE STALLS ARE ALIVE&lt;br /&gt;Johnny Cathcart, USA, 19 min.&lt;br /&gt;Exploring the intricate art of bathroom graffiti. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174943792000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173754463000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Urban Explorers: Into the Darkness</name><id>5563986</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174770900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5563986/</event_url></item>
