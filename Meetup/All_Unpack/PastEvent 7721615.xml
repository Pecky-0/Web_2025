This wine dinner is unlike others in Boston, you will be seated with your reserved party only. We will be personally visiting each table with the wines, rather than lecturing the group. As usual we will be pouring lesser known boutique Spanish Wines. The dinner will start at 7pm and costs $49 per person. A vegetarian option is also available for each course, upon request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Selection of savory bites &lt;br /&gt;  Marques de Gelida, Brut Reserva, 2003&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Fresh Mussel soup with with grilled herbed tostados&lt;br /&gt;  Las Brisas, Rueda, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Grilled Brie with a warm savory apple and quince chutney&lt;br /&gt;  Fuego, Old Vines Garnacha, Calatayud, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Madiera braised Cornish game hen served on a bed of exotic spring mushrooms &lt;br /&gt;  Juan Gil, Monastrell, Jumilla, 2005&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Grand Marnier drunken strawberries with a Spanish chocolate granache&lt;br /&gt;  Jorge Ordonez, Moscatel Selecci√≥n Especial, Malaga, 2005&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tascarestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tascaresta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for me or the Meetup group.
