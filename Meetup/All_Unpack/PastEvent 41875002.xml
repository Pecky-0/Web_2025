&lt;p&gt;I'm repeating this fun Bingo Card workshop from a year ago.&amp;nbsp;We'll be altering vintage Milton Bradley bingo cards (3.5 x 5.75 inches) by adding color, texture, images and 3d elements. I'll lead you through making your first card and show you several ways to display them. Then you move onto card number two while I go around offering individual attention to anyone who would like some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject and theme of your cards are up to you. St. Valentine's Day is coming up, but instead you could get a head start on Christmas with a card you got last December. Or think "Summer" with some beach snapshots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click below to see some samples created by Joan and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll each get a set of three bingo cards, some game pieces and&amp;nbsp;antique buttons. There will be plenty of tissue paper, ribbons, wire, colored pencils, acrylic paint, more buttons, assorted game pieces, magazines, books, and much more stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll also have some vintage images printed out, but you should try to bring a few images of your own. This is a good time to use any images that were too big for ATCs. Old family and pet photos are always great. And consider printing them out in black and white -- you can add back a little color using pencils and paint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIME:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 pm to 4 pm. I'll be staying well past 4 pm so you can stay later and continue working or leave at 4 without missing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yourself, your basic art kit (scissors, craft knife, glue stick, ruler, pencils eraser, markers, etc.) any images you might want to feature, a few rubber stamps you might want to use and other bits to add to your cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;$20 per person, cash or check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.) and some supplies including acrylic paints, collage materials, etc.&amp;nbsp;Access to a microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND&lt;/strong&gt;: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These smaller sessions&amp;nbsp;often fill&amp;nbsp;quickly. RSVP "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the unlikely event that we need to cancel due to bad weather or other reasons--or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pat</member_name><member_id>4858394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329237406000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321841685000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Altered Bingo Cards Workshop - for Valentine's Day or any occasion!</name><id>41875002</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329069600000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/41875002/</event_url></item>
