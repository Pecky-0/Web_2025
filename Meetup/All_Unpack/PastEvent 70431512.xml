Seated in the heart of the Seaport area, Salvatore’s is an upscale restaurant and bar. It creates a warm, welcoming atmosphere in a familiar Italian setting. Salvatore’s is nestled in the heart of the ever expanding seaside section of South Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have our own room and bar which is located to the right as you enter the restaurant. There are open air windows which open up during the warm weather leading to a neat patio setting. It is located across the street from the new and huge Legal Seafood. You will get a view of the water from afar as you look out from the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light appetizers will be provided compliments of Sitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray for nice weather so we can utilize the patio component. At the last two events here, it poured rain but we still had a fabulous turnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Our own room &amp; bar to the right of entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>4094202</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341939331000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Active "People" people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1425</urlname><id>1283834</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Sitzundjibers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340482777000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come join Sally &amp; the Sitzers at the Seashore...er Seaport!</name><id>70431512</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341871200000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1425/events/70431512/</event_url></item>
