I would like to keep the topics, metaphysically based (healing, meditation, psychic, medium.. ect) You are all welcome to come and enjoy, bring a friend. I will bring some light refreshments, you are welcome to as well! The more the merrier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am combining the Salem, Ma and Haverhill groups for this meet-up. If you are unable to make the end of summer meet-up this would be a good time to catch up as well.&lt;br /&gt;Time: 9am-12pm &lt;br /&gt;Cost: $10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refund Policy: I will not offer refunds, but you are welcome to take any other class or healing session as long as I get 24 hour notification of your cancellation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Readings By JD</member_name><member_id>9397498</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283147167000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gifted</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Friends-in-Spirit</urlname><id>1373252</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Friends in Spirit</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281839386000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discussion group-meet your group members</name><id>14425339</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283086800000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Friends-in-Spirit/events/14425339/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/4/global_7183796.jpeg</photo_url></item>
