<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi Group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, Alex Gershaw, have decided to step up to the plate and want to lead a hiking trip through the Fells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is about 4 miles or 4½ hours on the Rock Circuit Trail.  There is also an option to shorten the hike along the Rock Circuit Connector for a 2½ mile hike for about 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fells.org/thefells/trails.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fells.org/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have offered to provide breakfast before the hike at my home starting at 10:00am - you can show up anytime between 10 and 11 for breakfast.  I will offer eggs, pancakes, cereal, tea, orange juice, hot chocolate, and milk along with my warm hospitality!  What else could you ask for?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will leave my house promptly at 11:15am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is ample on-street parking allowed on the weekends at/near my house.  The street is however small and narrow, so you may need to park along the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is T-accessible - the closest T Stop is Oak Grove on the Orange Line.  It is literally a two minute walk from the station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend wearing non-cotton layers and bringing a light backpack with water and energy snacks.  See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you get lost or need to speak to Alex - 603-275-7930</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alex G.</member_name><member_id>2997556</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292175427000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290038033000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Middlesex Fells Reservation Hike</name><id>15482487</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290268800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/15482487/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/7/global_17076615.jpeg</photo_url></item>
