Anyone who enjoys coffee is welcome to come! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize but I had to make some last minute changes to the location of our meeting tonight because Barnes &amp;amp; Noble could not accommodate the size of our group. I hope this is not going to be a huge inconvenience for you. I sincerely apologize.&lt;br /&gt;The meeting has been moved to the Common Grounds, 1096 Main Street in Branford.&lt;br /&gt;There will be a table reserved for us and a delicious assortment of coffees and desserts will be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188082927000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184514592000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coffee Talk August Meetup - Location Change</name><id>6027212</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187910000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/coffee-397/events/6027212/</event_url></item>
