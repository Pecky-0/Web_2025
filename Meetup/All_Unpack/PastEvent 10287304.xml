Clients such as Apple Computer, Herman Miller, and Coca Cola use him to create credible well composed images for annual reports, advertising, and special projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Michael Malyszko takes photographs that combine true documentary photography with casual and formal portraiture for corporate, educational and institutional clients such as AT&amp;amp;T, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and Harvard University.
