This event will raise awareness and offer immediate, actionable steps that can be taken to support the health and well-being of these women, as well as provide the means to enable them to become self-sufficient and improve their quality of life. The keynote speaker will be Linda Mason, who is chair and founder of Bright Horizons Family Solutions, and who also chairs the board of directors at Mercy Corps. The evening will be a wonderful opportunity for attendees to network with peers, have some great food, meet and listen to an inspirational leader, and give all of us the chance to give back to our global community.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Lang</member_name><member_id>3926861</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291679151000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Scientific Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nexusproject</urlname><id>1294865</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Nexus Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289430204000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>HBA Boston Chapter- Annual Holiday Party </name><id>15408672</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291674600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nexusproject/events/15408672/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/c/global_12600668.jpeg</photo_url></item>
