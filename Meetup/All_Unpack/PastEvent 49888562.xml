<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a few people at the last sign wave, and we agreed that it'd be nice to have more variety in our signs, more handmade stuff with catchy slogans and art for future events. I would like to have a sign making party ahead of the Veterans March on the White House on Feb 20th (event info: &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/192677970828185/"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/events/192677970828...&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave will be bringing over stencils for banners to Robyn's. My husband was able to acquire a bunch of large sheets of cardboard from his place of employment for us to use as backing for smaller signs. I have some supplies, but probably not enough to go around, so please bring whatever supplies you can: posterboard/paper, glue, cutting instruments, markers, paint, stencils, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL ITINERARY FOR SATURDAY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't make it to all the places, that's fine! Just try to let me know which events you'll be attending (Robyn's house, sign wave, my house).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you on Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329057747000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327692115000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign Wave and Banner/Sign Making Party!</name><id>49888562</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328979600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/49888562/</event_url></item>
