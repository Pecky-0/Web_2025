&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Sixtysomething, single and a successful real-estate agent, Hildy Good is the affectionately flawed heroine of Ann Leary's second novel &lt;em&gt;The Good House&lt;/em&gt;. She's also the descendant of Salem witch Sarah Good — yes, that would be Goody Good. But no, she's no goody-goody.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Hildy has a tangled history with the North Shore Massachusetts town her family has called home for generations. She has a lusty past — and now present — with the local garbageman. She has a complicated relationship with her grown daughters — and most especially with the alcohol she (allegedly) swore off thanks to their intervention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;And after some new neighbors have moved into (fictional) Wendover, Hildy finds herself with a partner-in-pinot-crime, Rebecca McAllister, an old-money equestrian in a dull, new-money marriage addled with her own set of secrets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;We will be having breakfast or lunch (your choice) at the charming Optimist Cafe! Each woman is responsible for choosing and paying for her own meal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Originally, the Captain Howes House, this beautiful historic home was built in 1849 by Captain Frederick Howes (1812 - 1882). And is now listed on the National Historic Register. Stepping into the world of The Optimist Café is a treat not to be missed whether you are a Cape Cod native, or a treasured visitor from out of town. Aside from viewing one of the finest renovations done to an historic house on route 6A, the old Gothic Revival home boasts all the original wood flooring, original plastered walls and ceilings, spiral staircase and French doors. Come enjoy breakfast lunch, high tea and wine in one of the oldest homes on Route 6A.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Barbara will be wearing her Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Pin!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barbara </member_name><member_id>7313867</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367789313000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
