Have you wondered what Christmas is really about or why it matters? Is it about presents and decorations? Is it about family? Or is it something deeper? One option which might bring you a significant and rewarding experience this holiday season is to approach Christmas from the mystical perspective. Mystics interpret all the occurrences of Jesus and Mary's lives not only as literal events but as symbolic steps along the spiritual path. Every element of the Christmas stories relates directly to our inner being and serves as an inner guide on the journey towards God, bringing us into a deeper awareness of the inner truths of Christmas and the joyful mystery of the coming of the Light. In the Christmas story, Jesus and Mary represent specific aspects of us, as do Joseph, the wise men, the shepherds, the star, the stable animals and the stable itself. If you desire a more meaningful Christmas this year, join us and start the season with an in-depth look at the inner meaning of Christmas and how you can experience a truly spiritual holy season.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
