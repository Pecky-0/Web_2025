Wear sturdy shoes or sneakers and expect wet spots, with bumpy terrain. We will walk about 3 miles along the former railroad. The parking lot is on the east side of Colonial Road, Manchester, near its intersection with Parker Street. From Hartford, take I-84 eastbound to exit 63. Left off exit ramp onto Route 83/Route 30 toward Rockville. Go about one tenth mile, past the Big Y store and take first right onto Parker Street. Stay on Parker Street a little less than a mile, and turn left at the light onto Colonial Road. The parking lot for the Hop River Trail is on the left close to the intersection. There is a white and green sign for the Hop River state park. Extreme weather cancels. Sponsored by the CT Forest &amp;amp; Park Association Family Ramble Program, but all including singles are very welcome. No dogs, please. The terrain may be a bit wet, but it's fairly flat. Hike will be led by Susan Barlow of the Manchester Land Conservation Trust.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Clipboard in hand</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>39</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270305156000</updated><rating><average>4.55999994278</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>38</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267372580000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Moderate walk along Hop River trail</name><id>12732417</id><headcount>39</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269709200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/12732417/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/0/1/global_13364305.jpeg</photo_url></item>
