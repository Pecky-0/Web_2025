It shows how many of us are ready to take control of our own health and healthy eating is the first step!   When I started this group a little over a year ago I wanted to reach out to as many people as possible.  I wanted to have a safe place for people to meet and share ideas about healthy eating.  In that time I have met many amazing people and we all learn from each other!   &lt;br /&gt;HUGE announcement!!!!!   Our meeting site has changed!!  I am so thrilled!  We have been given access to an amazing room (WOODSIDE ROOM) at the Executive Court Inn (Next to the Yard Restaurant) 13500 South Willow St, Manchester NH 03103.  I have checked out the room and it is great!  We even have a fireplace! &lt;br /&gt;This month is going to be all about friends (old and new) great food and some fun.  At this time of year we need support in so many areas that are affected by stress!  Come spend a few hours with us and have some great food, conversation, and relaxation.  I ask that everyone bring a small $5 gift, re-gift, whatever....just try to make it either pertinent to raw or ecologically sound...the funnier the better!  We are going to do a little Yankee swap.  If the kids are coming....please bring a small gift for them so they don't feel left out.  Also as usual please bring a food dish (organic please) enough for 6-8 so we can all get a taste....if you have been coming to the potlucks you know a taste of all the dishes can fill you for a week!  I am already thinking of some yummy food to make...how about you?  If you are new and have no clue what to bring Google raw food recipes or give me a shout.  A green or fruit salad is always good. &lt;br /&gt;2010 is going to bring an even better raw experience.  I have started booking some amazing speakers and I also have some really good videos I want to make available to the group.  Education is the key.  My goal is to bring you some amazing educators. I am working hard to get that done.  If you have a favorite speaker let me know and perhaps they will come to Manchester.  Also thinking about starting a co-op to make it easier on the pocketbook.  Anyone interested? &lt;br /&gt;BRING YOUR WALLETS because there will be some goodies available for sale.  Jude will have fresh produce (we don't know what she will be selling because you never know what is going to be available.)    Just know that whatever it is it will be organic and much cheaper than at the store. She will also have chaga available.....highest in antioxidants!! I will have Almonds, chia, sesame, sunflower seeds and coconut for sale. &lt;br /&gt;Can't wait to see everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260152100000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>13</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>39</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257556400000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food December Meetup</name><id>ljqclymqbgb</id><headcount>42</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259971200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/11816010/</event_url></item>
