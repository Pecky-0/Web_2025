&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been requested to put together a open meditation for the community to share on 12-12-12 and 12-21-12. So, being the spirtiual believer I am I am happy to provide the following information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 12-12-12 at 12:00pm and 6:00pm and on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12-21-12 at 12:00pm and 6:00pm there will be one hour meditations, open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On each of these days the studio will also be open to the public all day for anyone wanting to have a quiet place to pray and meditate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be said for the changes going on for the earth right now and all the energy shifting we are going through. I know I am not the only energy healer that has an excess amount of vibration coursing through their body. Sometimes I question what I am feeling and want to make it stop. Sometimes I am just in awe that I am open and sensitive enough to feel it so clearly. That being said I also want to share I have been given information on how to reduce the vibration down to a tolerable flow with new tools I have learned. I feel it is my duty to share it with others that are having experiences with too much energy also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone coming to the evening meditations will have the opportunity to hear more about the new tools I am going to share. We owe it to oursleves to slow down, we owe it to ours families and we owe it to this wonderful island home we call Earth. I hope to see you here for the celebration of dimensional change with meditation and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a requested $5 donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love you all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
