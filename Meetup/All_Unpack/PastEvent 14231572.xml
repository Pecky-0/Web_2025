We can meet at 6:30PM and order dinner. The movie starts at 7:05PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be seeing the movie &amp;quot;Inception&amp;quot; with Leonardo DiCaprio. Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Falmouth Cinema Pub, tables of two and four decorate each theater. The swivel chairs are comfy for both dining and movie watching. We will arrive 30 minutes before the movie begins to order food, however, wait staff is available throughout each show to take orders. Twenty minutes before the end of the movie, the check will be handed out. Each woman is responsible for her own movie ticket, food and drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Falmouth Cinema Pub certainly offers something for every movie goers' taste. Popcorn, soda, and candy are all still popular picks, but now there are over 10 other types of food and drinks to choose form. Desserts, appetizers, soup, pizza, salad, burgers, sandwiches, beer, and wine now augment the menu. Appetizers, or &amp;quot;previews&amp;quot; as they are referred to, consist of curly fries ($3.99), mozzarella sticks ($5.99), boneless wings ($7.99), loaded nachos ($7.99), and several others. Clam chowder, lobster bisque, and chili are all each $3.99. Thin crust grilled pizza comes with several different topping combinations and has eight square slices ($6.99 - $8.99). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real meals are reasonably priced as well. A regular garden salad is just $5.99; add buffalo, plain, or Cajun chicken to it for just $3. Black angus burgers can come with chili, three choices of cheese, bacon, mushrooms, or just plain ($7.99 - $8.99). Various fish, meat, and chicken sandwiches are available ranging from $7.99 to $10.99. All burgers and sandwiches come with a side order of curly fries, chips, coleslaw, three-bean salad, or pasta salad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drink menu is also fairly extensive. There are several kinds of draft beer than is served by the glass (about $4) or a 60 oz. pitcher (about $14). Bottled beer, non-alcoholic beer, malt drinks are also available (about $4). Over 10 types of wine is sold by the glass ($4.50 - $7.50) or bottle ($18 - $28). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Barbara will be wearing her Girls Just Wanna Have Fun pin!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barbara </member_name><member_id>7313867</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281409046000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
