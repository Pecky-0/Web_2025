Even got one that was just buying a pizza named Brad :) So! come on down and join us for good friends, good food and G*R*E*A*T* cribbage :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good group, fun game play, relaxed environment. I've already pencilled in the next one, so spoke newbie Josh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cribbage Gods rewarded me with a win in a three-player game in which Micki only made it to 90. But then I lost 121-120 to a newbie, so spoke Gabe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once, I could be the skunker, and against Emad even, quoted Dave H excitedly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe, Bette and Ellen (welcome back)  played reverse cribbage and laughed the whole time away!!! And laughed so much that Joe left early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie was the newbie that beat Karen (I think skunk), beat Gabe, and then I think pummeled someone else at the end! And said: even with the Yodeling Pickle she would RETURN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND don’t forget about the Yodeling Pickle – come on down to find out all about this new musical!  A regift from Gabe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, the Red Cribbage Bag will be with the Café Angelina’s  employees and please give it back to them so I can pick it up from them when I return from my vacation to the Caribbean, thanks :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just kept walking in the door! Even got one that was just buying a pizza named Brad :) So! come on down and join us for good friends, good food and G*R*E*A*T* cribbage :) &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Micki E</member_name><member_id>4468648</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261091569000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cribbage Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WalthamCribbage</urlname><id>378600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Waltham Cribbage!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259767700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waltham Cribbage Meet-Up:  Relax In Between Your Shopping For Some F*U*N!</name><id>11999414</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260918000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WalthamCribbage/events/11999414/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/3/7/global_10878823.jpeg</photo_url></item>
