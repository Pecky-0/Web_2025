There will be cultural performances, martial arts, food vendors, etc. and we will walk around after dim sum.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to legend, in 1368 the Chinese overthrew the Mongol Yuan dynasty with the help of messages hidden in moon cakes. These tasty disc-shaped flaky pastries, filled with sweetened bean-paste and marked on top with the symbol of the baker, have thus become the food most associated with the August Moon, or Mid-Autumn festival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston's Chinatown is the third largest Chinese neighborhood in the country so festivities are usually a busy, lively affair with plenty to see and do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide my cell # to those that rsvp yes. I will be there early to put in for reservations.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have meetup name tag on</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve </member_name><member_id>5132502</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219161968000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218760387000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dim Sum &amp; August Moon Festival</name><id>8547516</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218988800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/8547516/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/0/global_5157232.jpeg</photo_url></item>
