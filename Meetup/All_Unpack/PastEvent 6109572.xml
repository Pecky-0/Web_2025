The route will go through parts of Boston, Charlestown, Everett, Winthrop, East Boston, and then to Deer Island, and back to Boston.  The route will be a mixture of busy streets and paved shared use paths.  Riders should have a bike that is in good condition, can ride an average of 10 ? 15 mph, and be comfortable sharing the road with other vehicles.  Helmets are a must.  (&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/482869/Boston%20to%20Deer%20Island.jpg"&gt;here is the route&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea for this ride was to make it both car &amp;amp; train accessible, so that everyone can attend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who will take the train: We will meet at the mini plaza in front of the Federal Reserve Tower adjacent to South Station. (&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/482869/South%20Station.jpg"&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;)    We will LEAVE PROMPTLY at 9:30am and pedal down to the Castle Island concession stand where we will meet with the others who are driving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who will drive:  Meet at the Castle Island concession stand (&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/482869/Castle%20Island.jpg"&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;) by 10:00am, where you will be met by those of us who are coming from South Station.  &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Commonwealth+of+Mass:+Parks+Castle+Island%2FFort+Independence,+boston,+ma&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.339768,-71.025581&amp;amp;spn=0.041301,0.08317&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;iwloc=A&amp;amp;om=1"&gt;Map to Castle Island&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we reach Deer Island, the return route will go near the Maverick T-stop (blue line) and the Sullivan Square T-stop (orange line) so if you need to bail out a bit early and take the T home you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring some $$ because we will stop for food somewhere along the way.&lt;br /&gt;Like always we are certain to have a ton of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonislands.com/isle_deer.html"&gt;About Deer Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rob Fox</member_name><member_id>4368625</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187011975000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185987186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>*40 Mile Ride: Boston to Deer Island</name><id>6109572</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186839000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/6109572/</event_url></item>
