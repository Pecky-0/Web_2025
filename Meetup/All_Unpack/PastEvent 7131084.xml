It is somewhat short notice, but if you want to see a good local band you should go to the Paradise Lounge this Friday at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is $10 at the door for the show but if you e-mail Aaron at rosenthalmusic@rcn.com and tell him your favorite current album he will knock off $4, making it only $6 for the three bands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven?t been to the Paradise Lounge it is one of the best smaller venues in Boston where there is seating and food available during the show. It is a great place to get a large plate of nachos and a cheap UFO. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a brief description of the band: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Blue Heaven appeared on the New England music scene in early 2007 with&lt;br /&gt;a dynamic brand of indie pop/rock, making new fans and generating industry&lt;br /&gt;buzz along the way. This Blue Heaven blends elements of jangle pop, folk,&lt;br /&gt;and new wave to create a sound that blurs the distinction between&lt;br /&gt;introspection and celebration.   Music, blogs, and other TBH goodies can be&lt;br /&gt;found online at www.myspace.com/thisblueheaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Blue Heaven at The Paradise Lounge&lt;br /&gt;Friday, Jan 18, 9pm&lt;br /&gt;18+, $10&lt;br /&gt;www.myspace.com/thisblueheaven&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Paradise Lounge&lt;br /&gt;969 Commonwealth Avenue&lt;br /&gt;Boston, Massachusetts 02215&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Moeri</member_name><member_id>4913745</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200881483000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Support a local Indie Rock Boston member, listen to some music and eat some good food</why><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200520341000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>This Blue Heaven at the Paradise Lounge this Friday</name><id>7131084</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200708000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/7131084/</event_url></item>
