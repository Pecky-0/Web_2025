There is an addition on this one that has an approximate 3-4 foot drop from the kitchen where a wall has been removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will learn to look at raw space and not be scared away by how a property looks in its existing condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Dress warm and wear comfortable shoes. There is no heat at this property and is a job site.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Baumgarten</member_name><member_id>6320255</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268060793000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Real Estate Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctreia</urlname><id>989128</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>CT REIA - The Connecticut Real Estate Investors Assn.
