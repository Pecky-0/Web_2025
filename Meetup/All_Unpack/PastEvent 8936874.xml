These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. Itâ€™s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! &lt;br /&gt;Tonight we are showing the film YOU CAN HEAL YOUR LIFE, which offers an intimate look into the inspirational life story of self-healing guru Louise Hay, her teachings, how she applied the teachings to heal her own life, and how they can help you handle the challenges you face. &lt;br /&gt;I welcome you all to join us for this inspiring evening!&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Rev.
