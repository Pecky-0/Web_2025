Tom.  We'll meet at the parking area on Christopher Clark Road (off Rt. 141) at 11am.  Here's a link to the google map where you can see where we're going to be meeting and to get directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;q=mt.+tom+state+reservation&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;hq=Mt+Tom+State+Reservation&amp;amp;ei=WmP0S9j_FIO88gbI4Yj4DQ&amp;amp;ved=0CCUQtgMwAw&amp;amp;hnear=Mt+Tom+State+Reservation,+Holyoke,+MA+01040&amp;amp;ll=42.264424,-72.639606&amp;amp;spn=0.002918,0.004801&amp;amp;z=18" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an intermediate level hike.  Please wear good sneakers or, preferably, hiking boots.  Pack whatever you like for a light lunch which we'll have at the summit.  Bring water and any snacks you might want; sunscreen if you want to be safe.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very initial part of the hike is the hardest - we ascend to the ridge fairly quickly and are rewarded immediately thereafter with the first of MANY fantastic views.  Because of the nature of the rock formations, there are several stops we'll be making where we can take in the views, commune with the hawks, munch a snack and relax.  Bring a camera!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm hoping to see a lot of us here.  If the day looks like rain, I may still go but I will reschedule a new date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP early so I can make the necessary arrangements.  This will be a lot of fun and is absolutely beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting by my car.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Xanatos</member_name><member_id>3183746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277048941000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Western Mass Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>western-mass-singles</urlname><id>414498</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>The Western Mass Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274308112000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Tom Singles Hike</name><id>13536327</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276959600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/western-mass-singles/events/13536327/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/7/global_15152583.jpeg</photo_url></item>
