The con "campus" consists of 5 major hotels, and the crowd gets bigger every year. Whether you're a Trekkie, Whovian, Jedi, Browncoat, literary nerd, anime fangirl/fanboy, etc., there is something for every fandom and every taste. Even if none of the panels, workshops, guest stars, filks, parties, dealers' rooms, art shows, film festivals, concerts, gaming, video gaming, LARPing, drinking, etc. appeal to you, you can still people-watch and see really amazing costumes. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be there for the entire con if anyone else is going and wants to meet up. You can still preregister for $105 for all 4 days until 7/13; afterwards, it will be $120. Individual day passes can also be purchased on site. &lt;a href="http://dragoncon.org/members.php#DC_Memb" class="linkified"&gt;http://dragoncon.org/members.php#DC_Memb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rosie</member_name><member_id>14232825</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347134300000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341343283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DragonCon:  Aug 31-Sept 3</name><id>71825432</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>280800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1346421600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/71825432/</event_url></item>
