You are invited to attend this meeting - get support with whatever is going on in your life, celebrate your success with a group of peers, connect with other men who are dedicated to personal growth. Learn more about men's work, &lt;a href="http://www.mkpne.org" target="_blank"&gt;the ManKind Project &lt;/a&gt;and the New Warrior Training Adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had several men ask me - what this is all about ? what do you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We sit in a circle on chairs. We talk to each other about ourselves. We listen intently. We do not shame or criticize. We do not spend time giving advice. We use processes to &amp;quot;dig in&amp;quot; to those parts of ourselves that we find confusing, upsetting and STUCK. We resolve conflicts, both internal and external, by taking responsibility for ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A men's group is a place to figure out what you want in your life, take steps to make it happen and continually look at what is getting in the way of you being fully alive and empowered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want better relationships?&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to learn how to better handle situations that stump you over and over?&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to break out of a rut that you have been living in for years?&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to sit with men actively working to make the world a better place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's an even harder question - do you instinctively NOT trust men (or women or yourself)?  You learned this somewhere. Not only is it bad for your physical health, but it is probably preventing you from living fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us! Support yourself!&lt;br /&gt;The ManKind Project is a world-wide community of men. We are not for profit and non-religious.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>park by Charlie's Diner - Look for AtoZ Moving Trucks and Auction Preview sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Boysen </member_name><member_id>7527796</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256944319000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Men</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>openmen</urlname><id>1200732</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5500030518</group_lon><name>Open Men's Group - Personal Mastery Workgroup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253751163000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Men's Group - for self-awareness &amp; empowerment October Meetup</name><id>11451358</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256770800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/openmen/events/11451358/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/d/global_4591725.jpeg</photo_url></item>
