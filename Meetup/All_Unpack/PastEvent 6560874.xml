We will have a morning get together starting at 10am (doors open at 9:30am) with a video conference with Dr Paul.  Then we will have some canvassing training by a long time top political advisor of Dr Paul, Tom Lizardo.  We will then go out and do various campaign related activities such as lit drops, sign waves, phone banking, etc.  We are inviting all the New England meetups, as well as anyone who wants to drive out!  We will have lunch at the cafeteria.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Paul is planning on video-conferencing with us, since our meetup got a telecon as a prize for donations.    He could be subject to last minute schedule changes, but for now, we are expecting the video conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location will be the New Hampshire Technical Institutes's Sweeney Hall Auditorium in Concord, NH.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have some activities planned for Sunday for those that can spend an extra night.   More details coming.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>25</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194312048000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>72</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192563980000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Video Conference with Dr Paul, and HUGE Event</name><id>6560874</id><headcount>164</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1194096600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6560874/</event_url></item>
