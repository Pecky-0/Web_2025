All are welcome to come out for a fun night. We will be going to the Red Door in Watertown. I haven't been there in a long time but this is what the birthday girl has requested. Good night out at this venue to get things heading in a great direction. Let's get social with other people who are attending and most importantly do what we do best and that's having fun! If you guys have any questions just email me or call me at 860-919-9782. Let's kick off the weekend friday night by enjoying ourselves and unwinding from the work week and let's wish her a happy birthday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call me or text me 860-919-9782</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John </member_name><member_id>6728192</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249854410000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247625192000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sara's Birthday Outing!!</name><id>10879339</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247882400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10879339/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/a/8/global_9676776.jpeg</photo_url></item>
