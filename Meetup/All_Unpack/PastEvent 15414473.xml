Please note that this is a meetup originally scheduled for November 10, but was moved by a week due to the Museum's early closing.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rita Kraner</member_name><member_id>3033713</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290114847000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Practical-Philosophy-Application-of-Timeless-Wisdom</urlname><id>1304986</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Practical Philosophy -- Application of Timeless Wisdom</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289485620000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>**RESCHEDULED** To November 17:  MFA TOUR OF EGYPTIAN COLLECTION </name><id>15414473</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290037500000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Practical-Philosophy-Application-of-Timeless-Wisdom/events/15414473/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/9/a/global_19385274.jpeg</photo_url></item>
