Took a little too long to get on the calendar...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the website:&lt;br /&gt;The best improv comedy you can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets available at the door for only $5.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.improvjones.com" target="_blank"&gt;Improv Jones&lt;/a&gt; uses several formats, many of which we made up ourselves. You can read about them here. We vary our format from night to night. Plan to be asked for a little input to get us going, and maybe some more during the show. Since we do longform, we don't rely on audience suggestions as much as shortform companies, but you're definitely a part of it. Everything we do from start to finish is made up on the spot. An Improv Jones show is provocative, iconoclastic, rude, sweet, and hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also probably schedule a meetup before hand to get together for dinner and drinks somewhere near the theater.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be out front of Perishable to gather the group</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227884287000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225979993000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Improv Jones @ Perishable Theater</name><id>9105868</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227407400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/9105868/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
