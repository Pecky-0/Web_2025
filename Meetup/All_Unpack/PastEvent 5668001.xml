Ciao!!  Hello!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Boston European Social Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;We will have our first meetup in Central Square in Cambridge on Sunday May 6th between 3pm-6pm. I have selected a caffe with a &amp;quot;European&amp;quot; feel and the best espressos in Cambridge, namely, La Luna. At the beginning of the meetup we will discuss the future of the Euro Meetup and hopefully get 3-4 volunteers to be Organizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La Luna only has 10 tables and about 30 chairs. If you have not RSVP you can still attend but you will have to stand  (those with RSVPs will be given priority to be seated). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is easy to find in Central square and inexpensive. The Green Street Garage is located on the corner of Green St. and Pearl St. Enter the garage by going down Pearl St. for one block (Pearl St. is parallel to Prospect St., one block east of Prospect St.) and then taking a right onto Green St. The entrance to the garage is on your left. This garage is only $1 per hour to a maximum of $5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 municipal lots along Bishop Allen Drive that are free after 6:00 pm. There is also a very large private lot on Prospect Street that is free and open to the public after 5:00 pm. &lt;br /&gt;There is an open-air city parking lot across Mass Ave behind Blockbuster Video (Bishop Allen Drive and Norfolk Street), and another open-air lot across Mass Ave behind Quest Diagnostics/McDonalds (Bishop Allen Drive and Douglass Street).  In both of these lots, the meters go off at 6pm so parking is FREE in the evenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are websites for the parking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.centralsquarecambridge.com/parking.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centralsqu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://gis.ci.cambridge.ma.us/directions/harvbridge_greenst.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://gis.ci.cambrid...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are websites for La Luna reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston.menupages.com/restaurantdetails.asp?areaid=18&amp;amp;restaurantid=7127&amp;amp;neighborhoodid=0&amp;amp;cuisineid=22" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston.menupag...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/bul_5Ahk_QYLUAJ4Od27jg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to meeting you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178651305000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176510317000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday May 6th - La Luna Caffe Central Square 3pm-6pm</name><id>5668001</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178478000000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/5668001/</event_url></item>
