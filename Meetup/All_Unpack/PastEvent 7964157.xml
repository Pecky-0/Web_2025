As always please bring cash to pay for food at the end so we don't have to spread the bill over credit cards! Thanks and I look forward to seeing everyone again in June!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Maccio.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213147566000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><why>If you enjoy sushi and food in general, good conversation, drinks and fun....you should come and be a part of our meet-up...we look forward to meeting new members.</why><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ct</urlname><id>900540</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven County Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211151830000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Middle of CT Sushi June Meeting</name><id>7964157</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212962400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ct/events/7964157/</event_url></item>
