Trailblazers provide a wide range of activities for single adults as well as opportunities to meet new friends. It also gives a sense of community and comradery. The club is not a dating service however. Trailblazers has no political or religious orientations. The club is propelled by member involvement at the monthly meetings and other events. The Trailblazers can be found hamming it up at the zoo, attending murder mysteries, bowling, or just holding serious discussions about topics of interest. They hold picnics at least four times a year, and have elaborate parties, some in masquerade. Trailblazers isn't a singles club for those who like to meet once a month for a meal and then go home to watch the early evening news. It's an Adventurous Outing Club for Singles who enjoy traveling to places, hiking mountains, kayaking in the surf, sailing, skiing, etc . Trailblazers lives up to the name, blazing trails through camp-outs in state parks, murder mystery parties, to new friendships for people of every age.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.55</rating><join_mode>approval</join_mode><created>1181044256000</created><lat>43.0699996948</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>242</id><urlkey>fitness</urlkey><name>Fitness</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>491</id><urlkey>dance</urlkey><name>Dance</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>498</id><urlkey>singles</urlkey><name>Singles</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>588</id><urlkey>dating</urlkey><name>dating</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>638</id><urlkey>hiking</urlkey><name>Hiking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1091</id><urlkey>newlysingle</urlkey><name>Newly Single</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1104</id><urlkey>singleparents</urlkey><name>Single Parents</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1273</id><urlkey>newintown</urlkey><name>New In Town</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1998</id><urlkey>travel</urlkey><name>Travel</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4422</id><urlkey>socialnetwork</urlkey><name>Social Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15892</id><urlkey>adventure</urlkey><name>Adventure</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>16550</id><urlkey>girls-night-out</urlkey><name>Girls Night Out</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>16660</id><urlkey>singles-30s-50s</urlkey><name>Singles 30's-50's</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17866</id><urlkey>meeting-new-people</urlkey><name>Meeting New People</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>20246</id><urlkey>dating-and-relationships</urlkey><name>Dating and Relationships</name></topics_item></topics><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name><id>519189</id><members>944</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>486997</member_id><name>Peter</name></organizer><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/6/c/600_2393356.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/6/c/highres_2393356.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>2393356</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/6/c/thumb_2393356.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Portsmouth</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/</link><lon>-70.7799987793</lon></item>
