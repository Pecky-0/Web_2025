While many of us have seen this one before, I think you will all agree that this would make for a splendid group event. And for those of you have not seen this early Hitchcock classic- you'll be in for a special treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With its great turns by Donat, Carroll (the original Hitchcock blonde) and all the cast, and immaculate direction of a cracking script, this is timelessly enjoyable. A true classic.  Channel 4 Films&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At 35, with more than a dozen features already under his belt, the director triumphed with this dazzling mixture of spycraft, banter, expository nonsense and manic chases along the Scottish Highlands.   Time Out NY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the fun of North By Northwest in a little over half the time, The 39 Steps is – even for the umpteenth viewing – absolutely unmissable.  Total Film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/b&gt; played exactly the way that British movies weren't supposed to, lively and piercingly funny, rather than stodgy and dignified; it was almost as much a comedy as a thriller, which was something new in any country's cinema; and it was almost as much a battle of the sexes in the jousting of its two leads (Robert Donat, Madeleine Carroll) as it was a quest by the hero to prove his innocence of a murder charge; by the end of the movie, we want to see not only how Richard Hanney (Donat) proves his innocence but also how he and Pamela (Carroll) manage to stay together.
