I don't believe a downpour is forecasted for this weekend, however I'm sure we'll still have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are welcome to join us regardless of your skill level. Even if you have never played flag-football you are welcome. We have a wide range of skilled people. If you feel the urge to play football, please join us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the T: Get off at the Alewife station. Follow the signs toward 'Rindge Ave'. Look for the Football field (stadium lights, grandstand, field house, turf field). See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ex: I'll be the guy in the back with a Meetup t-shirt</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221944015000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221187984000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT 3PM - FLAG FOOTBALL - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>8741788</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221332400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8741788/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/3/c/global_5447180.jpeg</photo_url></item>
