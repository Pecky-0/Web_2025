Follow the incredible story of a young crew's maiden voyage onboard the most advanced starship ever created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star Trek, which chronicles the early days of James T. Kirk and his fellow USS Enterprise crew members, has been digitally remastered into the unparalleled image and sound quality of IMAX through proprietary IMAX DMR technology. With crystal clear images, laser-aligned digital sound and maximized field of view, IMAX provides the world's most immersive movie experience. This film is rated PG-13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMAX Theatre&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The giant screen – 65’ high by 85’ wide – is taller than a six story building! The slight curvature of the screen extends to the edge of your peripheral vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing IMAX films will take you where you've only dreamed of going! Join us for incredible journeys to the bottom of the sea, outer space, and almost anywhere in between. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're interested we need to purchase our ticket well ahead of time. I'm charging for this event so I can get the tickets ahead of time and so people will commit :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258330185000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257221636000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Star Trek: The IMAX Experience - Crystal clear images, w/DMR technology  </name><id>11779011</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258156800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11779011/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/7/global_11621335.jpeg</photo_url></item>
