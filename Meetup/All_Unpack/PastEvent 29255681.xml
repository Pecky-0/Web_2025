  &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;When you RSVP, please note your ETA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;If the weather is questionable, I will email everyone who has RSVPed to whether or not the meetup is still off or on - ONE HOUR - before the meetup start time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;This meetup is for intermediate players ( 
&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/about/"&gt;levels 3.5 and higher&lt;/a&gt;) in competitive play. Because this is a small park (only four courts),&amp;nbsp; the maximum sign-up will be limited to 8 (with an automated waitlist). Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are disappointed that this particular meetup does not include beginners, you're welcome to join the weekend meetups or please feel free to suggest additional meetups on the day and location of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be there at 6pm hitting at the backwall or practicing serves until the first person shows up. Depending on the the number of people who show up, we will play doubles or a mix of doubles and singles. Please be aware that we have no way of reserving two courts so the earlier you can arrive, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crosby Park is located by Dearborn Academy between Oxford Street and Winter Street in Arlington, close to Rt 16 and the Somerville line. Parking is available on the street or in a small lot by the park off of Oxford Street. These courts are also accessible through public transportation by taking the Red Line to Davis Square and catching the 87 bus towards Arlington Center to the Oxford Street stop.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>4498873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1313548769000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1313168383000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tues PM Intermediate</name><id>29255681</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313532000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/29255681/</event_url></item>
