One of our newest members, Sergio, suggested that we read a Christopher Moore novel, Bloodsucking Fiends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for those of you not familiar with Christopher Moore (his best known book is probably Lamb), get ready for a wild and crazy ride. He has one of the most unique senses of humor that I've come across and he's the type of author that you will either love or hate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also admit my own bias here since I've read four of his other books. Each one has had me either shaking my head in disbelief at what he wrote or laughing out loud. So, come on out and let's see what you think about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at Ignite in Manchester which is a new venue for us. So, come out and join us on the 24th!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1269644719000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267660321000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>If you're a vampire, does that make you a bad person?</name><id>12775252</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269471600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/12775252/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
