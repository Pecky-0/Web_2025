Depending on how many show and do their &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot; &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will divide the group into smaller groups to stimulate discussion.  If the group is as large as it was at the first meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this isn't a book u want to read stay tuned for future books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I picked Panera Bread for our meeting in Hamden.  This place will have adequate parking.  I hope to see you then.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the host/hostess</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mark lufkin</member_name><member_id>9971393</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254351059000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New Haven 20s &amp; 30s Bibliophiles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>20s-and-30s-Book-Club</urlname><id>1489535</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9199981689</group_lon><name>People in their 20s and 30s Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248826257000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>20s and 30s Book Club August Meetup</name><id>10981061</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251241200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/20s-and-30s-Book-Club/events/10981061/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/8/3/global_10019763.jpeg</photo_url></item>
