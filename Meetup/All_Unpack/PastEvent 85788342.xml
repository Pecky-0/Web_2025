Tully Mountain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain Rd., Orange, MA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focal point of the Tully Trail and of the Tully Mountain Wildlife Management Area, Tully Mountain rises 1,163 feet above sea level and humps dramatically above the relatively flat land around it. Geologically, it is a remnant of ancient mountain building that upthrust the northern Appalachians 400 million years ago. From the northwest it also shows the effect of the glaciers—the northern face ground smooth, the southern face left much more irregular by deposited debris. A loop trail of about 1½ miles leads to outcrops near the summit that afford magnificent views of the surrounding land and waters and of more distant mountains. And Tully Mountain not only offers peace and pleasure to people but also—because of its numerous types of habitats—provides a home for a rich array of plants and animals. &lt;br /&gt;
