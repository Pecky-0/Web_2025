When he is done, then you can join us for the MTH Tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the Mark Twain House really Haunted?&lt;br /&gt;For you ghost investigators in the group,  you cannot use cameras&lt;br /&gt;in the MTH, but you can use recording devices &amp;amp; the Small Hand Held&lt;br /&gt;Devices that can gage for energy &amp;amp; can gage for heat loss &lt;br /&gt;(just remember that it is Winter like conditions in an old house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went on the MTH Graveyard Ghost Tour on 10/29, there were&lt;br /&gt;Some kids who had those devices, but I kept an eye on the devices&lt;br /&gt;and they did not &amp;quot;catch&amp;quot; anything.  I did sense something in the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Teaching Room&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Billards Room&amp;quot; but that time not in the &amp;quot;Nursery Room&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;As I did on 10/23.&lt;br /&gt;What I sensed on 10/23 probably went next door into the &amp;quot;Teaching Roon&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that I still need to do a Trip Report for 10/29.&lt;br /&gt;Mike B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/26/10&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the question of where do we meet?&lt;br /&gt;I sent those who RSVP Yes or Maybe a separate memo&lt;br /&gt;Before the Meet Up.  I will still do that for this MU.&lt;br /&gt;There are benches by the wall between the Information&lt;br /&gt;Room Enterance &amp;amp; where the tickets are sold.&lt;br /&gt;I will either be on or near those benches before the&lt;br /&gt;Meet Up (unless I get stuck in traffic or something).&lt;br /&gt;I will have my Purple Backpack with me.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that more members RSVP Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send another reminder closer to the time of this Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/15/10&lt;br /&gt;Mark Twain is still such a contemporary public figure&lt;br /&gt;That he was on the cover of Newsweek, August 9, 2010 issue.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had a chance to read the articles yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wants to take a tour of the Mark Twain House &amp;amp; Museum?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marktwainhouse.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.marktwainh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.marktwainhouse.org/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can talk about car pooling if you are interested in going.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will contact those who RSVP Yes and Maybe.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Crystal</member_name><member_id>2560755</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290494663000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Conspiracists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>conspiracy-83</urlname><id>648888</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Greater New Haven Unknown Zone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282355942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Unknown Zone Searchs the Mark Twain's House </name><id>14490336</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290365100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/conspiracy-83/events/14490336/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/f/f/global_2489375.jpeg</photo_url></item>
