It has been a great year for sports for New Englanders! March will be no exception, go Huskies! &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;What is March Madness food? Whatever it is, it is sure to be very special and very tasty. Join us with your favorite &amp;quot;game day&amp;quot; recipe ready to cook and have fun.  &lt;br /&gt;Location address in Waterbury will be shared after RSVP.    &lt;br /&gt;All adult folk are welcome. This is a monthly event with a good mix of ages and personalities. Come join us! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how it works, you pick a recipe that seems to fit the theme for the month. You bring the ingredients (and something to drink if you like) to the host's home. We all crowd into the kitchen and cook together. Then we sit down and exclaim in delight about all the wonderful flavors as we chow down on the different dishes. No one worries about who is bringing what because it always works out great. If your recipe calls for special (not found in most kitchens) equipment you should ask the host if s/he has what you need or you should bring it. If your recipe takes more than an hour to prepare and cook then do as much as you can before arriving or cook it at home (though that isn't as much fun) and bring it ready to serve. &lt;br /&gt;Some people have been bringing copies of their recipes printed out for everyone to share. I am collecting the recipes and will share them with everyone at some point. If you send me your recipe via email I will publish it on the group page.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It will be at Andi's place in March.
