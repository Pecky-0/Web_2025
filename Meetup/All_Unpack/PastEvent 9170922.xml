Cheap it is not, but the service is excellent and they care a great deal about food.  See for yourself at:&lt;br /&gt;  www.rialto-restaurant.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was there last week and enjoyed the:&lt;br /&gt;  - Tuna crudo with avocado, chilis and radishes;&lt;br /&gt;  - Macomber and parsley soup with curried snails on toast; and&lt;br /&gt;  - Lasagna with rabbit, sweetbreads and porcini&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(One of our members, Amanda, was at the next table.  She was hired last month as their director of public relations.  She'll make sure we are treated well!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the hostess for the Meetup group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Harold</member_name><member_id>5109349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228693040000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-625</urlname><id>824450</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Food Snobs Unite (FSU) - Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226807829000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rialto</name><id>9170922</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228348800000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-625/events/9170922/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/4/global_2985684.jpeg</photo_url></item>
