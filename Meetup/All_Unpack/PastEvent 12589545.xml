You can either pick them up at any time this week at the Harvard University Box Office on 1350 Massachusetts Ave in the Holyoke Center (617-496-2222) or you can pick them up at the Memorial Church itself, where the event is taking place. Customarily, the Box Office tells people that they only release tickets a half-hour before the presentation, but they said if people show up at 7:15 pm, they should be set up to Release tickets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be there at Memorial Church by 7:15 pm to pick up his Will Call  tickets and wait for the doors to open. He's not sure how packed this is going to get. In case we don't get to sit next to each other, anyone up for a beer after to discuss the presentation? Since he posted this event back in February, he is not sure how many of the 33 YES RSVPs are coming, so it's going to be difficult to save seats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Harvard University's Event Calendar&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/cal/details.php?ID=40871" target="_blank"&gt;http://ofa.fas.harvar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism is presented at Harvard University each year by the Harvard Secular Society on behalf of the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard and the American Humanist Association. Selected by a committee of 20-30 Harvard students each year, this award is given to a figure greatly admired by our students and community for both artistic and humanitarian reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Now in its fourth year, the HSS Cultural Humanism committee has chosen the recipients for the award, the MythBusters, based on what they feel is an outstanding contribution to Humanism in culture. The MythBusters – special-effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman – take on the task of separating truth from urban legend on their television show with the same name. In true Humanist style, the pair takes on three myths per episode and uses modern-day science to demonstrate, through scientific trials, whether or not some things we take for granted really hold any ground. The award ceremony (April 16 8:00pm Memorial Church) will feature a talk and demonstrations by the pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Previous winners of the Cultural Humanism Award are, in 2007, novelist Sir Salman Rushdie, in 2008, punk rock star Greg Graffin (of the band Bad Religion and the UCLA Faculty of Biology), and in 2009, writer/ director/producer Joss Whedon (“Buffy,” “Angel,” Firefly,” “Dollhouse”)&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Mythbusters&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/about/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://dsc.discovery....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;So. You're minding your own business, filling up your gas tank, when your cell phone rings. Hmmm. Should you answer it? Because you've heard you shouldn't use cell phones near gas stations since they can produce small sparks that can ignite big fires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;But wait. Could that actually be true? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Sounds like a job for MythBusters! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It's a tough job separating truth from urban legend, but the MythBusters are here to serve. Each week special-effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman take on three myths and use modern-day science to show you what's real and what's fiction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;That's right, they do more than explain how something may or may not be scientifically possible. Through trial and error they actually demonstrate it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;So don't miss these two experts attempt to ignite a fire with a cell phone or explode a toilet every Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET/PT&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Jamie Hyneman&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/meet/jamie-hyneman.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://dsc.discovery....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Hailing from Indiana farm country, Jamie Hyneman is a multifaceted man: wilderness survival expert, boat captain, diver, linguist, animal wrangler, machinist and cook, to name a few. His career has been as equally diverse: Jamie earned a degree in Russian languages and ran a sailing/diving charter business in the Caribbean for several years before he moved over to the visual-effects industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Once he had joined that field and had worked for several special-effects companies, Jamie found his way to Colossal Pictures' model shop, where he managed the production of models and special effects for hundreds of commercials and movies. Then, 16 years ago, Jamie took over the shop and created &lt;br /&gt;M5 Industries Inc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] Today, while MythBusters occupies the majority of Jamie's professional activity, M5 is active with developing cutting-edge technologies for a variety of industries ranging from defense to green vehicle design. In Jamie's own words, 'At this point, with over 130 episodes under our belts, I feel that we have evolved into different people than we were when we started Mythbusters. You can't go through all the mayhem we have been into on the show without it changing you. I feel like we are just getting warmed up'.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Adam Savage:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/meet/adam-savage.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://dsc.discovery....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Adam Savage has spent his life gathering skills that allow him to take what's in his brain and make it real. He's built everything from ancient Buddhas to futuristic weapons, from spaceships to dancing vegetables, from fine art sculptures to animated chocolate — and just about anything else you can think of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The son of a filmmaker/painter and psychotherapist, Adam has been making his own toys since he was allowed to hold scissors. Having held positions as a projectionist, animator, graphic designer, carpenter, interior and stage designer, toy designer, welder, and scenic painter, he's worked with every material and process he could get his hands on — metal, paper, glass, plastic, rubber, foam, plaster, pneumatics, hydraulics, animatronics, neon, glassblowing, mold making and injection molding, to name just a few&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
