<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Every Saturday at 9AM at the Davis Square Au Bon Pain, poets in the form of English professors, retired high school teachers, (also, hippies, mental hospital workers and patients) all meet together to discuss literature, and literary events they're hosting or attending. They call themselves the Bagel Bards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Saturday, we're crashing their bagel party and taking over. Although anyone is  free to attend at any week, this is a great opportunity to come and get your questions answered about the Bagel Bards and their purpose. (Since they're old, they might not want to repeat themselves)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many of you are fiction and non-fiction writers, and the Bagel Bards are known as a poetry group, but their various presses and events provide platforms for all kinds of writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find out more information about them here: &lt;a href="http://bagelpoetry.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://bagelpoetry.bl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264428232000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263820637000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>20-30 Somethings take over the Bagel Bards</name><id>12351006</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264255200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/12351006/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
