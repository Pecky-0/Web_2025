Witchcraft seems always to have been with us, but the  curious will ask: where did it come from and where is it going?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthropologists  often define witchcraft as &amp;quot;the use of malevolent powers by psychic means  without the need for ritual or charm&amp;quot;. This may have been so for the days of  the Inquisition but not for the contemporary western world where witches work  magic through spells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  class provides a historical overview of how modern-day magic evolved from early  man, the beliefs and customs of the Celts, and other ancient, Indo-European  peoples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class starts at 6PM followed by Open Circle at 7:30PM&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295662969000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290404811000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - History of Witchcraft</name><id>15523240</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294614000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/15523240/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
