Please check in at the volunteer tent, which will be located to the left of the Hatch Shell, at 10:00AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've done this for the past two years and have volunteered at the company tent and also as course monitors. It's a morning event on 9/15. We've also had a team walk in the past too. If there's interest from the club, please feel free to contact Alecia directly with the number of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
