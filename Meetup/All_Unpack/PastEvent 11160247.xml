One critic called it &amp;quot;an insult to the reader,&amp;quot; and another referred to it as &amp;quot;the greatest literary discovery of the year.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;                                                    --from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; review, 1934&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This then-shocking and revolutionary first fiction redefined the art of the novel with its acid humor, its nihilism, and its irreverent, explosive writing style, and made Celine one of France's--and literature's--most important 20th-century writers.

Yet, beneath it all one can detect a gentle core of idealism. Or can one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[t]errifying...—an enormously powerful and slashing, satiric, misanthropic writer. But what power of the imagination!&amp;quot; -- James Laughlin, founder of New Directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This is the novel, perhaps more than any other, that inspired me to write fiction.&amp;quot; -- Will Self&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263419349000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250804200000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Louis-Ferdinand Céline: Journey to the End of the Night</name><id>11160247</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252879200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/11160247/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
