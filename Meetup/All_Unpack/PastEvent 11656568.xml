Hike the Hancock Notch Trail for a novice hike or tag North and South Hancock Mountains. Two more official  4000 ft summits for your NH 48 list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clockwise or  go counter-clockwise around the loop.  Starting at the Hancock Notch trail head, plan on taking the Hancock Notch trail to the Cedar Brook trail, to the Hancock loop trail, and return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This round trip loop is 9.8 miles, 7.2 of which are relatively flat, only 2,940 feet of elevation gain, in 7.0 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late Fall conditions are in effect. Dress in synthetic layers and pack a change of clothing should your clothes get wet.  Pack water and food for 9 hours. There is snow in the upper elevations, traction (microspikes) are required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike starts out on a flat, easy walk on the Hancock Notch, Cedar Brook, &amp;amp; Hancock Loop Trails to the base of the range, then a moderate climb for .7 mile up to the ridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/9/7/event_1274487.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are spectacular views from both North &amp;amp; South peaks and along the Ridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hancock Loop Trail is the only trail to Mount Hancock, a 4000-footer at the edge of the Pemigewasset Wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos2.meetup.." target="_blank"&gt;http://photos2.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;It starts with old woods roads to the loop junction, climbs steeply to the N or S peak depending on which fork you took, then follows a wandering path along the ridge to the other peak before descending back to the loop junction. The route up the N peak is rougher and steeper so we plan to go up that way and down the slightly-better route from the S peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:Hancock Outlook, Lincoln , NH 03251&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions take I-93 Exit 32 at Lincoln and go E on NH Route 112 (Kancamagus Highway) about 11 miles to Hancock Notch Trail. There is a notable hairpin turn on the highway and the parking lot is right after the turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second hike option: A second light hike group can be formed for a intermediate level hike of the beautiful Hancock Notch Trail. This hike is suitable for beginner and intermediate hikers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the trailhead parking lot. /exchange phone #s</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed</member_name><member_id>8973391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258810006000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255910327000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North and South Hancock Mountain </name><id>11656568</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257598800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11656568/</event_url></item>
