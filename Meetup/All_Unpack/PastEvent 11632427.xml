We will ascend to North Twin via the North Twin trail, head over to South Twin, then down to the Galehead hut. After a short lunch break we will summit Galehead, then descend via the Gale River trail to a previously spotted car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our plan is for minimal short breaks along the way in order to finish the hike within booktime or faster, with a 8 AM boots on trail start time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Well behaved dogs are always welcome.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;We are not guides, but are inviting others to join us on a hike that we are doing.
