This will be a great opportunity for you to bring friends and family members who have questions about the events of 9/11/01.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the &lt;a href="http://www.loosechange911.com/lcfc.htm" target="_blank"&gt;FealGood Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, for the benefit of First Responders' families. John Feal, a 911 first-responder will be there to talk about why he formed the Fealgood Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The primary mission of the FealGood Foundation, a non-profit organization, is to spread awareness and educate the public about the catastrophic health effects on 9/11 first responders, as well as to provide assistance to relieve these great heroes of the financial burdens placed on them over the last five years. A secondary goal of our Foundation is to create a network of advocacy on 9/11 healthcare issues. We not only advocate for Ground Zero workers, but show others how they can advocate for themselves and help others through grassroots activism.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;CARPOOL DETAILS:&lt;br /&gt;(as of noon, day of event)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Concord and points north:&lt;br /&gt;call Charles for details @ 748-1758&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Manchester:&lt;br /&gt;looking for a carpool coordinator for Manchester&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Nashua:&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot of the 155 Main Dunstable Road medical building.&lt;br /&gt;Meetup time: 4:50, depart at 5:00 PM (call Jack for details: 233-1058)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from Amherst:&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the Amherst Town Library&lt;br /&gt;Meetup time: 5:05 PM, depart at 5:15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Downloadable flyer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see our files area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeremy</member_name><member_id>3581956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196379362000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193163937000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Loose Change Final Cut - Keene</name><id>6603474</id><headcount>350</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196206200000</time><rsvp_limit>300</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/6603474/</event_url></item>
