Join us for an audition to get an assessment of where you fit in with MM.  You can be placed in one of our training groups, a performance team or the dance company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The audition will be divided into 2 sections based on previous dance experience:&lt;br /&gt;1. Those with salsa dance experience - this audition will feel like a challenging salsa class with time to social dance at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Professional dancers in another genre (ex: African, hip-hop, jazz, etc) - the first part of this group's audition will feel like a salsa dance class and the second part  will be a chance to show MM your style of dance.  Bring music and 1-2 min. choreography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To pre-register send your name, gender and past dance experience/training to Anara at info@metamovements.com&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to audition, but cannot attend on this date, please feel free to let us know.  We can always arrange to assess your level during an MM class time.&lt;br /&gt;Audition Fee: $5&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anara</member_name><member_id>2988644</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221494878000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221083848000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MetaMovements Audition</name><id>8731972</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221321600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/8731972/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/3/global_522835.jpeg</photo_url></item>
