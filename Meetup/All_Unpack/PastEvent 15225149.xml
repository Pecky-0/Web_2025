It is such a beautiful place with candlelight in a very old stone building!&lt;br /&gt;If you have never been there before, this is the best night of the year to explore the arts center.  There will be artwork for sale but you are not obligated to buy anything.  Please come and visit one of the treasures of the Hartford area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet in the parking area and walk around together. I am inviting the French Meetup group too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Follow the signs from Route 44 in Avon next to the police station.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>3815102</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289608502000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Deutsch speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-425</urlname><id>438488</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6900024414</group_lon><name>The West Hartford German Kaffeeklatsch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288039845000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arts Center open house</name><id>15225149</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289603700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-425/events/15225149/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/b/b/global_3413819.jpeg</photo_url></item>
