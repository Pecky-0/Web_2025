It's a free quartet concert with NHCer pianist Alexis, titled &amp;quot;Conversation Among Equals: Romantic Chamber Works&amp;quot;.  Other professional musicians will play violin, viola, and cello.  They'll be performing piano quartets by Schubert, Dvorak and Brahms.  Bring your own date (she's taken).  Barry White CDs optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're late, only come in during a break (while audience is clapping).  Be sure your cell ringer is off (vibrate-only isn't good enough). It ends around 2:30pm.  If you can't stay until the end just be sure to leave during a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POST-PARTY: After the performance feel free to say &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; and simper &amp;amp; fawn over Alexis. There may well be a post-party...and there's the St. Patrick's parade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOST: &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/members/2469731/"&gt;Alexis&lt;/a&gt;, cell 203-747-9203. However, she won't be answering her phone starting an hour before the concert, and obviously not during it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hear Alexis playing some Mozart at her site: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist"&gt;www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: For directions, click &lt;a href="http://www.nmsmusicschool.org/directions.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I don't know what effect the parade will have on street closings, parking, etc.  It &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; go on Grove street, which is only 1 block from the concert! (&lt;a href="http://www.stpatricksdayparade.org/Parade_Route.htm"&gt;parade route&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING: Don't expect to find street parking on Audubon St. (which is a 1-way street). Whitney has street parking, if it's allowed on parade day, and there are parking garages in the area (such as &lt;a href="http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/ParkingAuthority/images/map.gif"&gt;on Audubon&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To go to the messageboard thread for this Event, click &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/messages/boards/thread/4293957#15655812"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205257324000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204402363000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sun 3/9 - Romance, with Alexis, part deux</name><id>7441266</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205083800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/7441266/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/8/c/global_351724.jpeg</photo_url></item>
