The goal of The Women's group is to unite all Jewish women in the area through exciting events and activities.

The Ladies Home Club comprises women of diverse affiliations and backgrounds who join together to have a good time, to explore Jewish themes and to work together to create and enhance community projects. 

The group will sponsor a variety of programs, including classes for women at homes in the Peabody area. Special Jewish women's events, and bi-monthly social gatherings which will explore Jewish themes. The organization's volunteers will also visit Jewish women in local hospitals and help to support Jewish families in a variety of situations. 
 The Ladies Home Club provides an opportunity to bring together women with divergent points of view, backgrounds and affiliations in an atmosphere of friendship,
