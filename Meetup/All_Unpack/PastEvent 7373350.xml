If you are taking the T, be sure to go LEFT after you get off the train. That particular exit will say &amp;quot;Russell field&amp;quot; and should dump you on the path to Russell (A 5 min walk, tops!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those driving, park in the public parking lot alongside the playing field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/2062/russelfieldio5.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/3478/russelfieldpathqk8.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>BK</member_name><member_id>4273085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205267060000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>It will probably be cold, but the field is TURF. You can wear spikes but don't need to for this surface. It was a lot of fun to play here last week, and we're going to continue. We hope to see you Saturday.</why><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203546425000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag Football at Russell Field-SAT-2PM</name><id>7373350</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1205002800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/7373350/</event_url></item>
