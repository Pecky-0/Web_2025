Stay straight on this road and very soon you will see an intersection with 3 other streets and a purple house.  Crescent St wants to bear left but stay straight and to the right of the purple house - this is where the road turns into Highland Ave.  Very soon, there will be a fork in the road with a green sign stating Highland Pond and Peabody Lane are to the left - take that left.  You will now see a tennis court on the left.  Continue on and you will see another fork in the road with a brown sign on the left for Highland Pond - take that left as this is Parkway St and follow it around a corner until you see the parking area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will post the trail map in the Files section under the More tab.  There are 3 trails and we can decide when we meet which trail to go on as some are easier than others.  Greenfield Town Hall has a link to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directions to Temple woods on the website say to go to Mountain Road but the parking area at Highland Pond is bigger and better IMO.  I am changing the start time to 9AM because it appears that the warmer weather is here to stay now and this could be hard on the dogs.  Also, I am not sure how crouded this place will be so I'm hoping the earlier time will mean less crowds.  I have done this in the weekday and it was nice and we only saw a few people with their friendly dogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not really any water (outside of a few murky ponds) so bring some for the dogs and yourself as well as bug repellant.  Check for ticks as you'll be in the woods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it should be mentioned that the Town of Greenfield has posted a Coyote Warning sign for this place but the sign has been there for years and some people that go there often have not seen any evidence of coyotes.  The area is surrounded by popular roads that are busy with traffic - see the aerial view on the map or on the trail map. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highland Pond is at the parking area but the pond is surrounded by overgrown vegetation and I am not sure if it is OK for the dogs to go in.  I have not seen anyone in the pond - dogs or people.  I do not believe there are alligators or crocs in the pond but I'm not 100% :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the new time is OK and I will see you at the parking area.  Please email me if you want more directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park at Highland Pond parking area.
