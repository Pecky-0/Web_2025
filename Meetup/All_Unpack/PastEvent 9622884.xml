<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>So it would seem that one of the greatest, if not &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; greatest, camp horror films of all time will be (dis)gracing the silver screen again, this time as part of Insomnia Theater at Criterion Cinemas in downtown New Haven. That's right, here comes &lt;b&gt;Army of Darkness&lt;/b&gt;, folks. If you're a Bruce fan, 'nuff said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not, then you're probably thinking something along the lines of, &amp;quot;I don't know, 'Army of Darkness', really? That sounds awful.&amp;quot; Well if by 'awful' you mean, awful fun, awful hilarious, and awful awesome, then you're right! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, think of this as a learning opportunity. After all, next time you find yourself surrounded by a horde of deadites, you could just think to yourself, &amp;quot;WWBCD?&amp;quot; (What Would Bruce Campbell Do?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is $5. Beer &amp;amp; other adult beverages are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to reach me (Ben), my # is 203-554-5144. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236055086000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233186499000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Klaatu!!
