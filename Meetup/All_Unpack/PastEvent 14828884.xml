Sax and horns encouraged.  We plan to play this Wednesday, and will probably switch the day to Sunday late afternoon/early evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a continuation of the East Cambridge Galleria area open mic that went on hold ~ a month ago.  It a blues style open mike for all types of music, but we are try to do at least 1 least a jazz set and some well known standards.  There are at least 3 musician/singer meetup groups participating, and usually other social/meetups/groups.  Songs on the songlist are:  What a wonderful world, Over the rainbow, sunshine of my life, summertime, and good ideas would be songs like Sheâ€™s come Undun, Blue Skies, Take Five, improvisations on great jazz/blues riffs &amp;amp; themes.  &lt;b&gt;Even if you don't play, come to check it out and have a drink to support the effort!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attention Party goers,  Musicians &amp;amp; Singers!!  Come join the party at the Wed Night Open mike!  Everyone Welcome.  No cover charge - Play or sing music solo or with backing band.  All instruments and styles welcome.
