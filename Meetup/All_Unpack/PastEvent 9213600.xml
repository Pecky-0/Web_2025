This is a new location for us, so be sure you give yourself time to get there.  Please note that we've moved the meetup to the 3rd Sunday, so that people can celebrate Easter Sunday as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that your host provides the soft drinks and paperware for each meetup, but we count on our members to bring the snacks.  Feel free to bring snacks for the Pugs, but bring soft snacks so that Clovis can have some too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you believe that some of our Pugs have been coming to the socials for THREE YEARS??  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOST A MEETUP?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let your organizer know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetups take place on the same days at the same times each month, unless otherwise indicated - our main meetup is the second Sunday of every month, and for those folks who either can't make the Sunday meetup or whose Pugs REALLY like to party, we have a second meetup on the fourth Saturday of every month.  Please note that all of the Sunday meetups are scheduled to take place at your Assistant Organizer Sharon Clark's home in Carver - where Buford, Millie, and Max hang out - and all of the Saturday Second Meetups are scheduled to take place at your Organizer Charlotte Creeley's home in Brockton - where Clovis, Cletus, and Boogie live.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're hoping that the folks who have hosted before will be able will step in and host a social or two in 2009.  For those who haven't hosted before, but would like to try, and if you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 30 to 60 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host!  It's fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOPHIE'S AND CARMEL'S FEBRUARY BIRTHDAY BASH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie and Carmel, two little former puppy mill Pugs adopted with their friend Roger from Green Mountain Pug Rescue by Lindsey and Alex Cyr, had a lovely birthday party at the Doggieritaville Doggie Daycare in Weymouth on February 22.  The girls had plenty of guests in attendance, both people and Pug, and PRESENTS!  Lots of presents!  Even Roger, the Pug boy in the little rescue Pug family of three, got to share in the presents.  A cake was provided for the birthday Puggies, and Happy Birthday was sung by all in attendance, including some of the Pugs.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to all of those folks who made the first birthday for these two little rescue girls such a wonderful event.  Thank you to Lindsey and Alex for throwing the party in the first place.  Clovis LOVED the meatballs that his mom brought home for him in a Puggy bag!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your babies. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. If he starts bullying or being too rough with another dog, give him a time out until he can get himself under control.  We want everyone to have fun!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $72.00 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis's, Cletus's, and Boogie's faces when the Puggie meetups roll around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>shar</member_name><member_id>2833949</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242583799000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>39</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227384892000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston April Pug Meetup</name><id>9213600</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240164000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/9213600/</event_url></item>
