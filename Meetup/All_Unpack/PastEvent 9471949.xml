We will start off in the front bar of New Haven's Playwright at 9:30 pm. Once the dancing starts (usually between 11 and 12), we will head to back to the back bar to hit the dancefloor. Once we are on the dancefloor we probably won't be able to hear our cell phones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the website, there is no cover at Playwright on Friday nights.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.niteimage.com/clubs/Playwright_NewHaven/Index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Playwright website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will start off in the front bar.
