They also close at midnight because they are literally in a residential neighborhood. Some of us who are also members of Providence Collective discovered the place Monday night and have decided to go back this Friday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come hang out for a few minutes, come and go, or join us for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Targeting &lt;br /&gt;E&amp;amp;O 7:30 – 9:30 - ish  (&lt;a href="http://www.eotap.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.eotap.com/...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;Avery 9:30 – 11:30 - ish (&lt;a href="http://www.averyprovidence.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.averyprovi...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very spontaneous gathering. We aren't calling ahead so don't expect anything formal. You can order food delivered from many local restaurants and eat at E&amp;amp;O - they have a file of to-go menus. If you haven't met us, look for a relatively cohesive group of people gathered in one spot towards the back of each place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you email me separately, I'll give you my cell phone to get in touch during the evening. The easiest way to find these two places is to get to Julian's on Broadway and then drive into the neighborhood (away from federal hill towards armory park). Look at the map linked to the venue!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256513697000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256079112000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Night out at E&amp;O and Avery</name><id>11673113</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256340600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/11673113/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
