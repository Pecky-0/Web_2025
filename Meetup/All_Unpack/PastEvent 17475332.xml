&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to a trail map of the park. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nhstateparks.com/Maps/pawhiking.html"&gt;http://www.nhstateparks.com/Maps/pawhiking.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click on the link note that Reservation Rd. (back entrance) is shown on the left side of the map and Mountain Rd (front entrance) is on the bottom of the map. &amp;nbsp;We will be parking where Tower Road intersects with Reservation Rd on the map near the number 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Once you turn onto Reservation Rd coming off of Route 107 in Deerfield proceed 2.5 miles.  The road turns into a dirt Road.  Look for a white Suzuki Grand Vitara with the license plate 308 0904.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304335039000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>This shorter hike will give anyone interested in hiking Mt Major later this month a taste of what some of trail sections on Mt Major can be like (a steeper trail section and a rock scramble).
