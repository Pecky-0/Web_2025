[b]Details[/b]

The movie time is 7:25 pm - not 7:15 as I said earlier! Sorry about that. I suspect AMC changed the movie time on me but maybe I was looking at the wrong day or something. I will still be in the lobby before 7. 

I will be wearing my red meetup hat. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables by the big window. If the movie is downstairs, I'll be waiting behind the rope across from the refreshment stand. I'll be at the theater before 7; we should go into the theater at 7:10 to get seats.

I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.

If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

It's the 21st century, but the gods of Mount Olympus and assorted monsters have walked out of the pages of high school student Percy Jackson's Greek mythology texts and into his life. And they're not happy: Zeus' lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. Even more troubling is the sudden disappearance of Percy's mother. As Percy adapts to his newly discovered status as a demi-god (his father is Poseidon), he finds himself caught between the battling titans of Mt. Olympus. He and his friends embark on a cross-country adventure to catch the true lightning thief, save Percy's mom, and unravel a mystery more powerful than the gods themselves.
