As we have grown, we have gotten away from it, but I always get good comments when we loosen the bonds of the meeting.  So...we'll talk about what you want to talk about.  Your desires will drive the agenda.  Bring your ideas and be prepared to participate.  This is gonna be fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets during the hour from 5:30 PM to 6:50 PM.
