I really dug their album &lt;i&gt;Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer&lt;/i&gt; from a while back.  It is an introspective, confessional account of the singer's near-nervous-breakdown living in Norwayâ€”which you would expect to be set to gloomy tunes, but is, instead, full of ecstactic energy and eloquence, in addition to being groove-rich and danceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40551/Of_Montreal_Hissing_Fauna_Are_You_the_Destroyer&amp;quot; target=_self" target="_blank"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Hissing Fauna&lt;/i&gt; is an endless supply of off-kilter but instantly appealing melodies intact over the band's newly robotic sound. The focus throughout is on mechanized rhythms and synthesizer swirls, though the tempos are no less hyperactive, and the attention span of the arrangements is only a shade longer. Occasionally, the bright synthesizers appear to mock Barnes' shadowy feelings, like the roller-skate organ riff that flits about the pleading drug-use of 'Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse', or the Christmas carol exterior of depression saga 'A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger'.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228529829000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220557492000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Of Montreal</name><id>8689311</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225407600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/8689311/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/0/global_3804400.jpeg</photo_url></item>
