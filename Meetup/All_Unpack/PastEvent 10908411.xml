<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>On-water practices are well underway, and we're getting ready for next race in Hartford! All paddlers, regardless of experience are welcome, including first time paddlers! It's a lot of fun, not to mention a great workout. Bring clothes you don't mind getting wet, non cotton synthetic material recommended. Paddles and life jackets are provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried you'll be the only one there, based on the meetup rsvp? We actually have between 20-40 people at each practice, so just because the meetup says 1-2 people are attending doesn't mean that's actually the case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email one of the meetup organizers or RSVP to the event to get started!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306933093000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddle-boston</urlname><id>1135553</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Living Root Dragon Boat - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248012595000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Practice (Introductory Session)</name><id>10908411</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249131600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddle-boston/events/10908411/</event_url></item>
