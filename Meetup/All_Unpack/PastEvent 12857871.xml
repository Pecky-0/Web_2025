If you can say Ticonderoga.... It's right near Lake George and they have an airport and a restaraunt there. From there, the nice easy flight up Lake George is amazing. It's a fun lunch and something amazing to see. All within 107.4 nms. Let's get outside and enjoy the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Called by some the “Gibraltar of America” or the “Key to the Continent,” Fort Ticonderoga was one of the most strategically important places in eighteenth-century North America. It is no wonder that battles were fought here during both the French &amp;amp; Indian War (1755-1763) and the American Revolution (1775-1783).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battles continue to be fought at the Fort, only now in remembrance and not anger. Twice a year historical reenactors bring Fort Ticonderoga’s military history to life through recreated battles, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interpreters in period uniforms tell the story of the Fort throughout the day. Weather permitting, they will offer a musket demonstration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The King's Garden is open June 1st - Columbus Day for tours from 10am to 4pm. Groups need to reserve in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/4B6" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;  \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fort-ticonderoga.org/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fort-ticon...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274622534000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268403781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Why not a visit to Fort Ticonderoga </name><id>12857871</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274617800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/12857871/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/5/0/global_13600432.jpeg</photo_url></item>
