The Cuban 5 are five Cuban intelligence officers who have been incarcerated in the United States since 1998 on trumped up charges of espionage and conspiracy to commit murder.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;They came to the United States to gather information on the activities of rightwing groups in Miami that had organized attacks on Cuba. A worldwide campaign is now protesting their unjust imprisonment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speakers: Prof. Demetrius Iatridis from the Boston College School of Social Work, Laura Garza from the July 26 Coalition and the Socialist Workers Party, and Nancy Kohn from the International Committee for the Freedom of the Cuban Five&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303940414000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Join Boston College students in learning about the case of the Cuban Five!</why><group><who>Socialists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialists</urlname><id>519668</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Socialist Party USA -- Boston Branch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1303357699000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forum on the Cuban 5</name><id>17381720</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303936200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialists/events/17381720/</event_url></item>
