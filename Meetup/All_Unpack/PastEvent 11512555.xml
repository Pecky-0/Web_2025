<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>OK, we have confirmation.  Our Tea Party is scheduled.  We will be at the Parkman Bandstand on the Boston Common, with speakers from 12:00 - 2:00 PM.  Todd Feinberg of WRKO will be our emcee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all need to start spreading the word.  It is entirely possible we will be, on the 17th, protesting a bill our Senate and House have already passed.  The Senate, under the leadership of Harry Reid, are trying to sneak a version of their bill into a House bill, which will pass.  Reid is, again, anticipating a vote within the week.  We need to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was watching Fox on Wednesday evening and the latest developments are that abortion funding will not be prohibited and immigration status checks will be prohibited in the Baucus (Senate Finance Committee) bill.  Is this what we want our tax dollars to pay for?  A public option that will bankrupt our country as it attempts to provide some level of care for anyone and everyone?  We've seen how our government handles the responsibility of caring for the poor, the elderly and our veterans.  We've seen in Massachusetts what government mandated health insurance ha done to our state, towns, businesses and tax payers.  Is this what we want for the entire nation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need your help.  If you are available on the 17th, I need assistance from 10:00AM - 3:00 PM, managing those in attendance and directing participants.  I need assistance handing out flags to children and collecting postcards to be sent to representatives.  And I need doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions or to volunteer, contact Christen Varley  gopmom@gopmom.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christen Varley</member_name><member_id>9247789</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257442276000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Tea-Party</urlname><id>1404985</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Tea Party</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254349172000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Healthcare Reform Rally</name><id>11512555</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255795200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Tea-Party/events/11512555/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/6/5/global_8177477.jpeg</photo_url></item>
