Join us for a fun walk to raise money for local food pantries and help us make a difference. This is your chance to come together to take part in the wonderful Massachusetts tradition to help feed hungry families in their community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Asian Meetup group has signed up as a team on the Project Bread Website and have a tentative goal of reaching $200 minimum.  If you plan to participate, please contribute $5/person toward the pledge. If you cannot make it and would still like to contribute to our group - please click on the link below. We appreciate your support and hope you can join us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have your own pledge sheet you are welcome to join us as well. And don't worry if you cannot walk the entire 20 miles - they have shuttle buses all along the route to take you back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress comfortably with sneakers and a light jacket. The weather forecast looks good for Sunday. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donation Link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.projectbread.org/site/TR/Walk/General?team_id=49130&amp;amp;pg=team&amp;amp;fr_id=1110" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.projectbre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting Location:&lt;/b&gt;  Boylston St. Green line T-stop, we will be right outside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; 8:30 am, Sunday May 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;Walking distance: 20 miles &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See route map below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.projectbread.org/site/PageServer?pagename=walk_route_large&amp;amp;printer_friendly=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.projectbre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-organizers:  Tran, Steve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tran: 781-484-7913 or tran_arch@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Above Boylston Greenline T-stop</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve </member_name><member_id>5132502</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241886230000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240875603000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2009 Walk For Hunger</name><id>10280756</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241353800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/10280756/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/e/global_4959758.jpeg</photo_url></item>
