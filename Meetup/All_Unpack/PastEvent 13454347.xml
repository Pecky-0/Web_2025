On Saturday, it is looking like a perfect golf day.  I have two tees times, one for 12:48 pm and the other for 12:56 pm.  We have 5 people so far and need three others for another foursome.  Please email me back and let me know you are all interested and I look forward to hearing from all of you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good rest of your week.  I look forward to hearing back from everyone.  My cell number is 617-640-9634 if anyone has any questions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Club House </how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287855014000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>golf-260</urlname><id>1127024</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2200012207</group_lon><name>The Boston and Beyond Golf Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273618142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Golf-Hillview Country Club-North Reading</name><id>13454347</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273939200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/golf-260/events/13454347/</event_url></item>
