The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ” &lt;br /&gt;Irene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ This was a fun time. Alan's leadership style is loose, offering suggestions and some instruction. Nice group of people, too.”&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ It is the best drumming circle in the area! People really come together in a community, and with a community spirit. Instruments are provided if you don't have one. ... ” &lt;br /&gt;A former member&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drumconnection.com"&gt;The DrumConnection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll welcome you at the door! ...and make sure you are very comfortable.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>1328052</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268441572000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drummers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DrumConnection</urlname><id>886763</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>The Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266121798000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Drum Circle Meetup - Come Celebrate with us.</name><id>12600065</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267228800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DrumConnection/events/12600065/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/6/global_3485414.jpeg</photo_url></item>
