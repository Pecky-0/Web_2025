One of the Italy's finest films.  Said to be one the most required films to be watched in Film Studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Italy, 1973) Director: Federico Fellini. Screenplay by Federico Fellini and Tonino Guerra.Director of photography: Giuseppe Rotunno. Music: Nino Rota. Cast: Bruno Zanin, Pupella Maggio, Armando Brancia, Magali Noel. Cinestudio presents a newly restored print of Federico Fellini's masterpiece of coming of age and remembrance, Amarcord. The magical, surreal, bawdy and emotion-suffused images of life in the director's hometown of Rimini on the Adriatic coast is a perfect introduction for Fellini neophytes, and a bello tresoro for his many fans. Amarcord is set in the 1930s, where a keenly observant boy soaks up everything around him, from the sexual repressions of the Catholic Church and the scary emergence of fascism, to the outrageously lascivious Volpina and the town's melancholy, would-be movie star, Gradisca. But it is the mysterious visual images - a ocean liner disappearing into fog, a peacock spreading its wings in the snow - that linger well after the curtain comes down. &amp;quot;CAPTURES FELLINI AT THE PEAK OF HIS CINEMATIC POWERS IN AN EYE-POPPING RESTORATION!&amp;quot; - Andrew O'Hehir, Salon.com 127 min.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I continue to look like my picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243641294000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240279969000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fellini's Amarcord</name><id>10231016</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242084600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/10231016/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
