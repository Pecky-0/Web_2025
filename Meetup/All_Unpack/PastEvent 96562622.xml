There is something beautiful about the beach and ocean with the snow. The sand dunes are a great hike and yes we are allowed on them! $7 fee per car to get in..We hike for about 2 hours and then head to out for food and drinks after (TBA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to wear&lt;/strong&gt; - WARM clothes. Ski jacket or windbreaker. Ski pants are good or something lined. It is VERY windy, especially in January, so dress accordingly. Definitely recommend a hat, scarf, gloves, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For feet - sneakers are fine, but recommend winter boots or hiking boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start promptly at 12:00 noon. There will be three different hikes of varying distances. We will all finish hiking by 2:00 pm and head over the Ipswich Sports Bar, which is located at 24 Hammatt St in the center of town.&lt;/p&gt;
