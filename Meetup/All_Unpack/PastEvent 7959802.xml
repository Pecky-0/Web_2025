A HUGE success! Really a lot of fun! This band is awesome!  Reggae , island style.. &amp;quot;Kelley B is a sexy chick playing a mean horn, keyboards &amp;amp; sing'in! &amp;quot; (taken from their website) ONCE YOU HEAR THIS BAND YOU ARE HOOKED! &lt;br /&gt;The view from the deck is just fantastic... the music, the drinks, the food and the view! You can't ask for more! &lt;br /&gt;www.michaelsharborside.com&lt;br /&gt;www.hotlikefire.net&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME: I plan on being there before 3pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: if you get there early, there isn't a cover charge. &lt;br /&gt;          if not, I believe it is $5.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interested? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE: After being @ Michael's Harborside we will be heading over to THE GROG! &lt;br /&gt;            for PARKER WHEELER'S BLUES PARTY! &lt;br /&gt;_Jo&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will all get together up on the TIKI DECK.
