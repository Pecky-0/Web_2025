Two Natives won a pair of tickets at our last event. Stop by and say hello to Beth who will be hosting the event. Beth is in charge of Bleacher Bar and Game On for the Lyons Group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there, Fenway Frank  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey Guys!  &lt;br /&gt;  We are hosting an event at the Bleacher Bar to benefit 2 awesome organizations, Best Buddies Massachusetts and The Special Olympics Massachusetts!  It is a free three hour event and we will be giving away 10 pairs of Sox Monster Tix!  How?  Well, the more you eat, drink and donate the more chances you have to win.  Every $5 you donate to either charity you receive a raffle ticket, and for every $10 you spend at the bar equals a raffle ticket.  Its that simple, so come have a good time for a good cause!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Bleacher Bar. 82A Lansdowne St. Boston, MA  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270249407000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269366107000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monster Tix Giveaway</name><id>12969103</id><headcount>108</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270076400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/12969103/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/5/2/global_13864178.jpeg</photo_url></item>
