&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join a select group of adventurers&lt;/strong&gt; as we discover the wonders of Portland, Oregon and the Cascade Range in July 2012.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/c/d/4/event_77636532.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll explore active volcanoes and ancient lava flows, 10,000-foot peaks, Alpine meadows, living glaciers, hot springs, virgin forests with massive, moss-draped trees, and many of the spectacular waterfalls these Cascade Mountains were named for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also visit beautiful Portland, lush with flowers and gardens, hand-crafted ales, smoked salmon, world-class wines, outdoor cafes and markets, beautiful architecture, colorful history, and the largest bookstore on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ten years before coming to New Hampshire, I lived in Portland and explored Oregon's wild landscapes at every every opportunity. We'll be visiting places I came to know and love during those years and have always wanted to share with friends from New England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an active trip, planned around easy to moderate hikes each day. The following itinerary is still preliminary and is subject to change in its details - but not in its spirit. My goal is to create a trip with with a maximum of outdoor time and a minimum of driving while visiting some of the most amazing places that this spectacular region has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll arrive &lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;, meeting at our (really cool) hotel in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we settle in, we'll find a great place for dinner and our first glass of Oregon wine or ale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday:&lt;/strong&gt; We'll find a great place for breakfast (with the best Northwest coffee) and explore the city, maybe visiting the &lt;a href="http://japanesegarden.com/"&gt;Japanese Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, Powell's City of Books, and a large &lt;a href="http://www.portlandsaturdaymarket.com/"&gt;outdoor art market&lt;/a&gt;. There's even a 5,000-acre city forest park with over 70 miles of hiking trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/8/0/event_82168032.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Sunday: We'll drive our spacious van to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_st_helens"&gt;Mount Saint Helens National Monument&lt;/a&gt;. This very active volcano erupted in 1980, devastating the landscape for miles around it. There will be much to see and we'll be sure to get in a hike among the miles of trees snapped like twigs and enormous mud flows the explosion caused. If there's time, we might also visit &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape_Cave"&gt;Ape Cave&lt;/a&gt;, one of the longest lava tube caves known to exist, before we return to Portland for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/5/2/event_82169522.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Monday: We'll drive to the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and begin a loop around the Cascade Mountains. The Gorge has sheer basalt cliffs and breathtaking waterfalls. We'll stop at several places along the way and then do one of the most beautiful hikes imaginable along a particularly spectacular side canyon. You'll lose count of the waterfalls and turquoise pools within the first two miles, and the trail is flat so it's also a very easy hike. Afterward, we'll visit the interesting town of Hood River for a brewpub dinner our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday/Wednesday:&lt;/strong&gt; We leave the river valley and head into the Alpine zone.  Mount Hood stands at over 11,000 feet and if conditions permit, we'll hike to one of the many glaciers flanking its summit. Fortunately, there's a fire road that will take us most of the way but this hike will be moderately strenuous. As we stand at almost 7,000 feet, we'll be higher than any mountain in the eastern US but only 2/3 up the east side of Mount Hood. We should see colorful meadows of wildflowers, a roaring glacial river, and sublime views for a hundred miles, centered on a string of snow-capped peaks.  If you'd like a less strenuous day, take the chair lift up to Palmer Glacier and just hike back down. There is also an impressive depression-era lodge built with massive timbers where we can relax in front of a roaring fire. And we'll sleep in a rustic lodge run by a local hiking and climbing group. All meals are included for these two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*If time allows, we may head away from Mt Hood via the high desert, and hike among impressive rock formations and sage brush before continuing our itinerary below...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/d/e/event_82169662.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Thursday: Ancient Forests. Virgin Forests. Old-growth. All names for the still-untouched tracts of land in the lower-elevation woods. The trees are 6 feet in diameter, standing over 200 feet tall, and hundreds of years old. Moss covered and mysterious, where spotted owls fly and plaintive, flutelike thrush songs echo through the deep forest. We'll take a short hike to a deep-woods hot spring. There are soaking tubs hewn out of giant cedar logs to relax in and as much of the forest to explore as we want. Thursday &amp;amp; Friday nights are spent in a riverside cabin or bunkhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;: In the Central Cascades, more virgin forest, rivers and waterfalls, and an amazing ancient lava flow to explore. This time we'll rent mountain bikes and ride one of the most beautiful bike trails in the country. (Option to hike rather than bike is available.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday/Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;: Today we leave the mountains and head for the coast. We'll spend the next two nights in an oceanfront hotel in the town of Newport. We have the option of stopping off at an incredible state park with more waterfalls even than the Columbia Gorge, or maybe we'll stop at one of Oregon's famous wineries on the way. There are many options depending on how we feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: More coast hiking including possible whale sightings, and many huge, mossy trees before heading back to Portland. Again, we have the option of detouring to one of the many wineries that might dot our route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Breakfast, and reluctantly, flights home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/e/e/event_82168142.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;This trip is for a small group of adventurers who want to get outside and enjoy some incredible wilderness  and an amazing city in the Pacific Northwest. Each day has physical activity but there will be options for just how much or little the individual or the group want to do. I've striven to find interesting but affordable lodging options, and accommodations will be in hotels and small bunk rooms. This is a group trip and we will be sharing rooms, meals, a comfortable van, and some incredible experiences together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dates&lt;/strong&gt;: Fri, July 13 - Tuesday, July 24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;: $1450 -11 days. Airfare is not included and will range from about $350-$450.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's included&lt;/strong&gt;: 11 nights' lodging, National Forest permits and entry fees, 9 meals (3 days' worth), van rental, fuel, and insurance. And other expenses including guidebooks, maps, parking, etc. You only need to provide airfare and the remainder of your meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSVP to this post right away if you're interested. And p&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lease do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns. It will be a small group so we can adjust details to accommodate!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
