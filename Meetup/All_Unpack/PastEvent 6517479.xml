For details, go here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.meetup.com/280/calendar/6852993/"&gt;http://movies.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit1: the star will smith is @least entertaining during all of his films... even ali. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the director francis lawrence came from music videos... but his film constantine w/keanu reeves looked visually appealing. ya know, david fincher (the game, se7en, fight club, panic room) also came from music video background. not saying francis is fincher... just a reminder to keep your mind opened! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Am Legend is also based on a richard matheson book. in the book, it's vampires, in the films it's been some kind of zombie variant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running time: Runtime: 1 hr. 40 min. | PG-13 Animal and zombie violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Will Smith, Alice Braga, Salli Richardson-Whitfield&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director: Francis Lawrence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genre: Sci-Fi Disaster Film, Monster Film, Science Fiction, Sci-Fi Horror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Neville (Will Smith) is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable and manmade. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City, and maybe the world. But he is not alone. He is surrounded by ''the Infected''?victims of the plague who have mutated into carnivorous beings who can only exist in the dark and who will devour or infect anyone or anything in their path. For three years, Neville has spent his days scavenging for food and sending out radio messages to find any other survivors. All the while, the Infected lurk in the shadows, watching Neville?s every move, waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind?s last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But his blood is also what The Infected hunt, and Neville knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailer: &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/iamlegend/hd/"&gt;http://www.apple.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Please do not RSVP YES if you do not intend to come. Yes is not a MAYBE. If you can't figure out what your going to do in the future, please do not burden us with that. Please buy your tix AHEAD of time! Will Smith is a megastar and he usually sells out entire showtimes during opening weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is playing downstairs in auditorium#2. I'll be right behind the corded rope after ticket stubs have been ripped in front of the popcorn counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there @6:30PM and whomever shows up early will go in and grab a row for 8 people total. I will wait until 6:45PM SHARP! The film's showtime is 7PM. Please don't be late because it will be PACKED and the cinema will be like a zoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;quot;ll be wearing my trademark green hat+Meetup logo+my screename JediFonger in front as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film ends, I'll be waiting right in front of the big screen near the exits w/my green hat+Meetup logo+my screename JediFonger. The group often goes out afterwards and socialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This even is run by JediFonger.
