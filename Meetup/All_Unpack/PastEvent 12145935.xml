And Sunday looks decent so for those who want a shorter hike than the other one posted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A socially paced 3 mile or so walk at Northwest Park in Windsor.  Dogs and kids are welcome, though leashes are required for the dogs!  I will have my large and active puppy with me, so if you don't like dogs, you may want to skip this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the parking lot at 2:30 and expect to be on the trail by 2:45 at the latest.   We should be done in the 4:00 to 4:30 range and for those who are interested could stop for a pizza afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information and directions to the park at &lt;a href="http://www.northwestpark.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.northwestpark.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
