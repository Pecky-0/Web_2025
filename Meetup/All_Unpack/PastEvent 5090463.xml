This does NOT replace the regular meetup, but is in addition to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did this last year as a surprise party, but it's not realistic to hope to be able to pull that off again. If you are going to be late, just note that when you submit your RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would like to hold this event in the tatami room (floor space), so it is very important that you RSVP at the earliest opportunity so we can get a good estimate of attendance. Plan on removing your shoes and dining traditional Japanese style.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zigamorph</member_name><member_id>2030415</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1158074629000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ri</urlname><id>197204</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156231456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Special event: Sushi Birthday Party</name><id>5090463</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156460400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ri/events/5090463/</event_url></item>
