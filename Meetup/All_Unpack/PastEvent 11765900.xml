Long story short Congress eventually proposed the Twenty-first Amendment which was passed for the explicit and nearly sole purpose of repealing an earlier amendment to the Constitution. The short and sweet story: The 21st amendment ended national prohibition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate a little bit of American History let's raise a glass and have some great pub food in one of the best pubs in town where rumor has it that JFK drafted his speeches by the fireplace in the back. A block from the State House, it is easy to get to, has friendly waitstaff and a great menu. I hope you can join me!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send out my cell #, but we'll be seated in the back room.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1259190511000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257128258000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The 21st Amendment - a bar full of history</name><id>11765900</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259017200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11765900/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/5/global_11586565.jpeg</photo_url></item>
