O'Neil's CAN SLIM® approach. Investing is about playing the probabilities. Thanks to O'Neil, we know what these probabilities are and how to use them to select winning stocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The May talk will focus on the S (Supply and Demand) and I (Institutional Sponsorship - the elephants who are responsible for driving price up or down) in CAN SLIM®. You will learn:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How low float, coupled with sufficient average daily volume, raises the probability of choosing a high performance stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How and why institutional buying volume helps you time your buys and avoid dead money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;What daily, weekly and monthly routines help you spot and understand the actions of the elephants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the importance of earnings and earnings anticipation in driving stock price, there will be a section of the May talk devoted to finding more fundamentally strong stocks, and, if Mr. Market continues to co-operate, another stock pick of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second in a series of interactive talks with Mike Kinkead at the Wednesday Boston IBD Meetup. Everyone is encouraged to contribute his or her experience and expertise to the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;IBD Group Rate for Upcoming Level 1 Seminar!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a effort to help members get started on their own journey learning the IBD (TM) Method, we have secured a special offer from IBD for 50% off on the June 28 seminar in Boston! &lt;b&gt;To learn more, go to this link:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/81154/Boston%20IBD%20Meetup%20Special%20Offer%20-%20Level%201%2C%2028Jun08.pdf"&gt;http://files.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Talk led by Doug Roberts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug has delivered his Market Talk ever since we moved to MIT. The banter in our group of bulls versus bears has become vigorous as the market alternately rallies and tumbles.
