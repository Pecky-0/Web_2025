I was out of of town and did not get their note telling me and apologizing for not notifying us earlier, so I apologize for the late change in venue. I am canceling the Fenway Bark meetup and moving it to Peter's Park, so get ready for a SUNDAY meetup at Peter's Park! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Meetup dues are $3 per Frenchie... I am planning to be there to collect so please bring a few bucks to help cover the costs for the next 6 months of meetup fees. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Your Frenchie's canine brothers, sisters and friends are more than welcome to join us at the park! Please abide by the weight/size limits posted at the entrance to the small and larger dog entrances. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Get your meetup on and come join the fun, there is plenty of metered parking right on Washington St next to the park!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to keep changing up the Fenway Bark meetups, we will make sure to have some more great meetups there over the winter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much, Zeek!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zeek</member_name><member_id>49571912</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353934899000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323881538000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>**Change Of Date &amp; Venue** November French Bulldog Meetup - part deux!</name><id>44443792</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353855600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/44443792/</event_url></item>
