This event has just been announced to several other meetup groups and&amp;nbsp;is at overcapacity due to RSVPs from other groups. If your RSVP has been removed it is because you are a duplicate and already on the list with another gtoup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives organized this event last week with guests from Boston Happy Hour and Social Fun with nearly 40 people attending. We had a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will return to the Greatest Bar on Sunday, November 27 at 3:15pm to watch the Patriots take on the Philadelphia Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar has kindly reserved the&amp;nbsp;2nd floor lounge area for the Red Sox Natives and guests. Enter and go to the second floor. Look for the Red Sox Natives signs. Come early at 3:15pm to get yourself a prime seat and and enjoy some pre-game socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game time is 4:15pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar is super conveniently located next to the TD Garden and on the Green and Orange Lines and Commuter Rail at North Station.&amp;nbsp; The Red&amp;nbsp;and Blue Lines are within a 10 minute walk and street parking is also available if you arrive early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO AND TIP YOUR SERVER.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar will be offering a $10.00 bucket of select beer and a cheese pizza to members and guests of our group. They are also offering $3.00 select beers for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar has a minimum requirement to reserve the entire floor. Please RSVP now or ASAP as this will sell out since the Red Sox Natives&amp;nbsp;are inviting several groups to join us including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Fun (AO Duncan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun with Alcohol (AO Duncan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
