There is a building and a metal &lt;br /&gt;Guard rail there if you try to drive out that small &lt;br /&gt;Drive way. I would recommend going back out &lt;br /&gt;Via the Medical Center Parking Lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some parking on Orchard Street, then you can &lt;br /&gt;Walk to Center Street &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The businesses are from right to left facing that side &lt;br /&gt;169/ Mia Boutique, Eden Attorney, Ecuama, Jakes Tavern, &lt;br /&gt;Medical Center and some Reality Co.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two doors on Center Street leading &lt;br /&gt;Into the Tavern, but I went in the door to the &lt;br /&gt;Left through the bar area. &lt;br /&gt;Go towards the back of the Tavern where there is a &lt;br /&gt;Large lounge area with a Big TV Screen. &lt;br /&gt;That is where the Band will be playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reserving a table in my name &lt;br /&gt;Like I did the last time that I was there with my &lt;br /&gt;Meet Up Groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading up Wallingford history, Jakes Tavern was one of the locations &lt;br /&gt;Used in A.D. Calvo film of The Other Side of the Tracks. &lt;br /&gt;I never saw the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Connecticut" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Connecticut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some members at Jakes to hear some rock and roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably take I 91 N to Exit 13 to &lt;br /&gt;Right on Rte 5 to Right on 150 / Center Street. &lt;br /&gt;I used to work in that area years ago and that is the long&lt;br /&gt;Way that I am more comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some new members so I am sending out this reminder &lt;br /&gt;Memo out a few days before the Gig so that they will have a&lt;br /&gt;Chance to RSVP for this Event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Organizer of Coffee Talk&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be waiting outside of the bar 15 minutes before 9 pm.
