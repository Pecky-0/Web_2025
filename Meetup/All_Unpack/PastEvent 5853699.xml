I will be wearing a badge as usual.  Please make sure to be on time.  This movie will be showing in one of the larger theaters downstairs and it gets very confusing as the waiting line is very close to the ticket buying line.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show won't get out till after 10, and although, people taking the train have to keep an eye on the clock, there should still be time to go out and grab a drink afterwards, if there is interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The official web site is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harrypotterorderofthephoenix.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.harrypotte...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: In &amp;quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,&amp;quot; Harry returns for his fifth year of study at Hogwarts and discovers that much of the wizarding community has been denied the truth about the teenager's recent encounter with the evil Lord Voldemort. Fearing that Hogwarts' venerable Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, is lying about Voldemort's return in order to undermine his power and take his job, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, appoints a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher to keep watch over Dumbledore and the Hogwarts students. But Professor Dolores Umbridge's Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves &amp;quot;Dumbledore's Army,&amp;quot; Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184679035000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181006000000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harry Potter</name><id>5853699</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184454900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5853699/</event_url></item>
