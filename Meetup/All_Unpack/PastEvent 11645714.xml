Even today’s most basic digital cameras have remarkable macro (close-up) capabilities.  This workshop is all about getting in close and capturing the details of the world around us.   The discussion will be about shooting small objects and subjects in nature. We will learn how to to set up a “macro studio” and the basic lighting of small objects.  So if you want to make shots of ladybugs and flowers or you want to put products online this is a class for you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is especially of interest to jewelers and crafters who want to show off their workmanship.&lt;br /&gt;We will have a class discussion followed by hands on activities to sharpen your close-up photography skills.  We will cover focusing and depth of field control, exposure control and lighting for small objects. You will learn how to set up your own table top studio and to work with the lighting tools you have from standard light bulbs to off camera flash. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a good class for beginners and more advanced photographers who do not understand their camera macro features.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unsure about your camera controls or digital cameras we would suggest enrolling in the PHOTOGRAPHY 101 and PHOTOGRAPHY 102 courses to bring you up to speed.&lt;br /&gt;Fee for class is $35.00 per person.
