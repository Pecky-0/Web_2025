Join park staff on Wednesday, December 29th from 10:00am to 11:30am to explore the area’s landscape shaped by glaciers and forest fires.  As we hike the 3-mile Easthead Reservoir Trail, we’ll explore the complex history that has shaped this landscape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meet at Park Headquarters at 194 Cranberry Road in South Carver.  Program is free and open to the public.  For adults and older children who can hike 3 miles at a moderate pace.  Please dress for the weather.  Program will be cancelled in the event of rain, snow, or icy trails.  Reasonable accommodations are available upon request. For more information, call Amy at (508) 272-9376.
