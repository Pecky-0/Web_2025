Brown University is kicking off their season with "Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde." They always do such a great job, and tickets are cheap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tickets/Meeting place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are $17 for adults. Please purchase your own ticket in advance from the Brown Box Office, &lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Theatre_Speech_Dance/performances/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.brown.edu/...&lt;/a&gt;. Their shows do sell out, so I recommend getting your tickets early! The show starts at 8 pm. We will meet at 7:15 pm in the lobby of the Leeds Theatre and then get seats together. The theatre is on Waterman St. in Lyman Hall. As you come down Waterman, it is on the right. Look for street parking nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the show, we can get dinner/drinks/appetizers around the corner on Thayer Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no information about the play on Brown's website, but here's the Wikipedia version: The play deals with Oscar Wilde's three trials on the matter of his relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas, which led to charges of "committing acts of gross indecency with other male persons". (The first trial was a civil suit brought against Douglas's father by Wilde himself; the second and third were on the criminal charges against Wilde, with the second reaching no verdict and the third resulting in a conviction and sentence to hard labour.) The play uses real quotes and transcripts of the three trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
