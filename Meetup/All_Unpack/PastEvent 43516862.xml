We had a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will return to the Greatest Bar on Sunday,&amp;nbsp;January 1 at 12:30pm to watch the Patriots take on the&amp;nbsp;Buffalo Bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar has kindly reserved the&amp;nbsp;2nd floor lounge area for the Red Sox Natives and guests. Enter and go to the second floor. Look for the Red Sox Natives signs. Come early at 12:30pm to get yourself a prime seat and and enjoy some pre-game socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game time is 1:00pm on New Years Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar is super conveniently located next to the TD Garden and on the Green and Orange Lines and Commuter Rail at North Station.&amp;nbsp; The Red&amp;nbsp;and Blue Lines are within a 10 minute walk and street parking is also available if you arrive early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO AND TIP YOUR SERVER.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar will be offering a $10.00 (Not a typo) bucket of select beer and a cheese pizza to members and guests of our group. They are also offering $3.00 select beers for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Bar has a minimum requirement to reserve the entire floor. Please RSVP now or ASAP as this will sell out since the Red Sox Natives&amp;nbsp;are inviting several groups to join us including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Fun (Isabele)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Is Our Playground&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
