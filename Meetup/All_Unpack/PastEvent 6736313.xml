<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flag football at Cambridge Common will continue, year round and regardless of weather conditions. We all hope that you can make it this weekend at 2PM. We are a stones throw from the Harvard Square T-stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome to join. We are looking to have a fun outing with flag-football players of all skill levels. Even if you never played flag-football before, it is easy to catch on, and you will have a great time. We have a great bunch of players. For the regulars, it will be exciting to get back out there and continue playing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cambridge Flag-Footballers&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195499040000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195001685000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag Football - 2PM - Saturday</name><id>6736313</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195326000000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6736313/</event_url></item>
