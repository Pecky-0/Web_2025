(sorry for late notice). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keith Lockhart and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus invite you to join them at the Prudential Center at noon on Saturday, Dec. 4  to attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the most carolers in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current record is 7,514 carolers, held by Bob Jones University in South Carolina, set in 2004.  In order to beat the record, more than 7,514 carolers must sing continuously for 15 minutes. This special Guinness World Record event kicks off a weekend-long Prudential Center celebration, December 4 and 5, of the Holiday Pops season at Symphony Hall, December 8-26. Details about the season are available at www.bostonpops.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the world record attempt with Keith Lockhart and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, the Berklee Musical Theater Club will perform to entertain those gathering for the noontime event. WROR Radioâ€™s Loren Owens and Hank Morse from the Loren and Wally Show will host the festivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The record attempt will happen promptly at 12:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every caroler participating in this event, the Boston Pops will contribute $1 towards providing Holiday Pops tickets for children from underserved communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let's meet at the entrance nearest to the cheesecake factory (Huntington Avenue) right inside the foyer (at street level) at 11:30 to head over to the Boylston side for the festivities.  I'll be wearing jeans, a black coat, red scarf and reindeer antlers.  I'll also have a handwritten Meetup/Nerdfun sign.  I'd encourage you to get christmassy...it's not every day that an ordinary person gets to help break a world record.  Have fun with it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I'm traveling from north of Boston by car and T, I won't have access to check meetup after 10:30.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing jeans, a black coat, red scarf and reindeer antlers.
