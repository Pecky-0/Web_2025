This time, not far from the Green St. Cafe, just around the corner in fact, is the fabulous, innovative and delicious Bistro Les Gras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris and Mark have been there many times, in fact, you could call them &amp;quot;regulars&amp;quot;, and this is one of their favorite places to eat in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the words of the owners:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At Bistro Les Gras we offer the finest farm to table dining in the Pioneer Valley.  Located minutes away from fertile farmland we work with an amazing group of farmers and ranchers to assure that you are eating the finest and freshest produce as well as the highest quality free-range meats.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that fits right in with our committment to supporting local restaurants creating and serving innovative food crafted from local sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign up early because we only have 25 spots and they go quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can't wait to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica, Christine and Kirsten&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will be the ones laughing the loudest</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271373143000</updated><rating><average>3.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>food lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Western-Mass-Eat-Up</urlname><id>1464899</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western Mass Eat-Up!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266815581000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bistro Les Gras is the March, 2010 EatUp!
