It was the usual string stuff: Bach, Handel, Haydn. But they also tried out a couple of Susanna's Beatles and The Doors arrangements. Those were a hit. Emboldened, the Cello Chix started showing up at Open Mic Night at the Burren, replaced their traditional cellos with electric ones, ditched the Baroque, and soon got gigs playing rock music at bars around the Boston area. The latest addition to the band is kickass percussionist George Nickson, who's as comfortable with a drum set as he is with a glockenspiel. The Cello Chix now have a repertoire of over 50 classic rock, jazz, pop and Latin tunes, a loyal and sizeable following, and a CD, under the covers.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a joint meetup with Boston Live Music, so there will be a good crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out their MySpace page:  &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/thecellochix" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/thecellochix" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cover charge.. &lt;br /&gt;Hope to meetup with you there..&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy who looks like my picture :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick</member_name><member_id>8876864</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253546454000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252958024000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cello Chix @ the Alchemist in Jamaica Plain</name><id>11370520</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253239200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/11370520/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/4/global_10714532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
