I've e-mailed my mobile phone number to RSVP's of yes and maybe so if you join after tonight, drop me a note and I'll give you the number.  Fingers are crossed the weather holds, I want to climb!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's climb on Friday just because we can.  :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, just drop me a note. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you then, &lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal hanging out a picnic table in red pants and grey or white sweatshirt.
