The ride is 192 miles of twisting, rolling roads with some lakes and rivers of beautiful Litchfield and Fairfield counties thrown in.  After leaving civilization behind, the road climbs for 4 miles followed by rollers that drop us at Barkhamsted Reservoir in New Hartford; stop at Saville Dam for a photo op, then by Mcdonough Reservoir, more uphill through Minetto State Park and off to Cornwall- home of the landmark Cornwall covered bridge (1841). From there we ride down Route 7 following the Housatonic river and the Appalachian Trail to Candlewood Lake, passing POIs that include the Town of Kent, Kent Falls, Bulls Bridge, Candlewood lookout tower and a few great vistas. We follow Candlewood Lake nearly to its end before getting on the  twisty roads of CT37 and CR66/67 over to NY. Ride hard or stop for pictures- tough choice here. Up NY22 with a stop for lunch, coffee and dessert (every ride should have a coffee stop without the initials &amp;quot;DD&amp;quot;); a brief detour onto CR6 to follow Tenmile River; then back to the main road and return to CT via NY SR343 and CT4. The rest is easy as we hook up with Route 7 just north of where we left it earlier and ride up through Great Barrington finishing at exit 2 on the MA Pike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain date for Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257259179000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256340007000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CT  The Country Diner Tour</name><id>11697257</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257085800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/11697257/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/b/5/global_11097765.jpeg</photo_url></item>
