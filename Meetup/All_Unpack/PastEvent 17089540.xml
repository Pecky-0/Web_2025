&lt;p&gt;We have done this event time and time again. But, everyone seems to  enjoy it each time. So, please bring the dogs, the kids and friends.  Join Steve O. and his friends for an easy hike through 170 acres, up  wooded trails.  This is Andreas' Sculpture Park with art work from  sculptor from around the world, all along the trails. At the top of the  trail is a spot with seats and a view of Mt. Manadnock 75 miles away.   Where we can sit and talk a short brake This is where we usually have a  picnic in the warmer months. If you can not make it at 1:00 pm?  Than  meet us at anytime along the trail. The trail crisscrosses the main  driveway to the top and the art studio. We park below at the start of  the paved driveway.&amp;nbsp; Steve O. will have his Ceil phone on to help find  us. Dress for changing weather and the woods, and remember the Deer  Ticks. Bring your own drink.   This is privet property. So, what we  bring into the park. We must bring out.    &lt;br /&gt; Contact: Steve O. ob@tds.net   603-491-1962  &lt;br /&gt;www.andresinstitute.org&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call Steve O 603-491-1962</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301931366000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1301340786000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art Gallery Hike</name><id>17089540</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301850000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/17089540/</event_url></item>
