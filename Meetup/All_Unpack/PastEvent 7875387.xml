I really try to add all the turns and stuff but once in a while i have left out something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get onto Rte 9 south, (its a left exit off of 91 south past Wethersfield) then head to (Cromwell/Middletown) go to exit 19 &lt;br /&gt;Turn (right) off the exit, =west toward Kmart and Stop and Shop &lt;br /&gt;At the first light you see (intersection of rte 372 and rte 3) take the left (south toward stop n shop) onto rte 3= shunpike rd &lt;br /&gt;There is a KFC, MackDonalds, and a Drunkin Doonuts while heading to the next traffic light. Use Drunkin Donuts (driveway) there is an empty lot which is ok to park in, if there is no parking, park down in the far back of the Drunken Donuts lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a water trail sign showing the most dangerous animals and what not to feed the animals...including the banjo boys... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have  spare kayaks with me for anyone that wants to use them. BUT YOU MUST KNOW WHICH ONE...since most of em are ocean types and not very stable for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oNE KAYAK i found EMPTY after the last person became dinner for some wild animal.. &lt;br /&gt;No sinGing &amp;quot; Har... Paddling in a dead mans kayak, looking over my back, in case the gohst wants it back..&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip usually takes 2 hours or so but if we do some exploring ..then its over when its over provided you have not been eaten by wild creatures....&lt;br /&gt; iF YOU SURVIVED..thank GOD&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be driving my blue Toyota Avalon with the Kayak Trailer and orange cones</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AL-r</member_name><member_id>2711041</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210276611000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209995271000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>River Checkout trip..Sunset on the Mettabassett River Cromwell/Middletown CT</name><id>7875387</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210023000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/7875387/</event_url></item>
