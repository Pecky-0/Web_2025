Bring rain gear just in case and layers to keep warm, if needed. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A generally looping hike of moderate difficulty where we'll aim to hike 4 hours. The hike would have a fair amount of up/down on the trail. There is plenty of trail so we'll see how far we can go and explore. I figure roughly 4 - 5 miles of hiking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot across from Quinnipiac University at 2:30 PM. The hike would start from the trailhead off of the parking lot.  We would finish at about 6:30 PM and head out to eat if people feel inclined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions via MapQuest for parking lot off Mt.
