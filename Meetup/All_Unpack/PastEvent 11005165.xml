There are plenty of great pubs in good ol' Southie, including the old and famous L Street Tavern from the films Good Will Hunting and The Departed. In addition to great pubs, beer (drinks) and food, there's also miles of beautiful beaches not far from may of the pubs we'll be hanging out in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first pub crawl was a real blast!!! Everyone maintained their composure :) but we still managed to have lots of fun. By the time the crawl was over, new friends seemed more like old friends. You'll see! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and join me and the gang again for another day well spent getting to know one another better, checking out ol' Southie (a very cool part of town) over a few beers/drinks and some great food. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details to follow.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254366916000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249087509000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Joint Event: A South Boston Pub Crawl</name><id>11005165</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253980800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11005165/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/c/global_9960524.jpeg</photo_url></item>
