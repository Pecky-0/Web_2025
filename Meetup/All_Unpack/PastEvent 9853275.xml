Julia and Amelia Land enlist Jacksonâ€™s help to find out the truth about their younger sister. They embroil him in the complexities of their own jealousies, obsessions and lust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another woman named Shirley needs Jackson to help find her lost niece. Jackson meets solicitor Theo Wyre whose daughter, Laura, was murdered in his office and is desperate for Jackson to help him lay Laura's ghost to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he starts his investigations Jackson has the sinister feeling that someone is following him. In digging into the past Jackson seems to have unwittingly threatened his own future. This wonderfully crafted, intricately plotted novel is heartbreaking, uplifting, full of suspense and often very funny.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My pic is on the site &amp; I will have a copy of the book on the table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242171504000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235940633000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Readers : Case Histories by Kate Atkinson</name><id>9853275</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240160400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/9853275/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/1/global_7506945.jpeg</photo_url></item>
