The first to arrive will grab a table at Applebees (next to the theater) around 6:15 PM.  During dinner we will review what movies are playing and have a start time between 7:30 and 8:00 PM.  Whatever the majority can agree on is what we'll see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP Marie will respond with her cell phone number so if you're running late and can't make dinner, you can find out what movie we've decided to see and when it starts.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>When you RSVP, I'll respond with my cell phone number.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marie A</member_name><member_id>4623326</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218752794000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217221435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a Movie Night</name><id>8425061</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218579300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/8425061/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/b/global_3153499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
