I might be there by 8pm, even though I'm not eating. &lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with Princeton Station is that they won't do separate checks, so that's a BIG turnoff to me.  The positive to PS is that they never charge a cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;quot;Rock City Band&amp;quot; really plays great music, and dress is casual, if you like.  check'm out at www.rockcityband.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get there by 8pm, I'll be happy to introduce you to everyone, but once the band starts at 9pm, you're on your own, because I'll be on the dance floor &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;  I will of course have meetup signs, so you'll know where we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see you then,&lt;br /&gt;suz&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signs on the tables</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278391472000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
