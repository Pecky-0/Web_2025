&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Ms. Marci &amp;amp; the LoveSick Hounds"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ms Marci" (Marci Chevian-Hooper), is the driving diva behind the Lovesick Hounds. She&amp;rsquo;s a commanding presence on stage as she grasps the audience with her musical sleight of hand from the first note she plays on her lipstick-red bass. Her talent gives her a range of styles &amp;ndash; from R&amp;amp;B to rock and roll; jazz to swing &amp;ndash; all with equal skill. Chevian-Hooper has been a winner in the preliminary Connecticut Blues Challenge contests, as well as sharing the stage with some of contemporary music greats like Muddy Waters, Luther Guitar &amp;lsquo;Junior&amp;rsquo; Johnson, Pinetop Perkins, Willie &amp;lsquo;Big Eyes&amp;rsquo; Smith, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and B.B. King."&lt;/p&gt;
