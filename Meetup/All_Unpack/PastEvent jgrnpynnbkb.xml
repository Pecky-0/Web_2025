Come join us and we'll have fun playing a question game and eating tacos and burritos at Chipotle Mexican Grill in North Andover! 

* Pertinent questions and multi-choice answers that you could impress friends and family with! 

* You are NEVER singled out and are part of a team of four! 

* Good chance for some laughs, meeting new people, a drink or two, and tasty food &amp; appetizers! 

* Wonderful Authentic Mexican Food!

The schedule is: at 7:00 we order our Mexican food and mingle. At about 7:30 - 7:45, we start playing a really fun new trivia game where we partner you with other team members.

It's a blast. Believe me.

We &lt;&gt; have reduced prices for food gift cards (ie., $12 for a $20 card and I will keep you posted on that.)</description><how_to_find_us>You will see the large trivia 'horse track' board</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gregory DerBogosian</member_name><member_id>12639635</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286496509000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285696138000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Night Group Trivia Series &amp; Mexican Food!!</name><id>jgrnpynnbkb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286492400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/14933434/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/f/global_17102863.jpeg</photo_url></item>
