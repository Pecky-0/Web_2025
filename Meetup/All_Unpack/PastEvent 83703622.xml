It is called V Organic Cafe and is run by long-time vegan, Veronica Ramos. Saturday hours are 8-12, so rather than the traditional hike, followed by lunch, we can do brunch, followed by a hike at Purgatory Chasm, which is 20 minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the V Organic Cafe at vorganiccafe.com. It's an interesting place, featuring an art gallery of local fine art, organic skin care products, hand-made by Victoria, as well as household items, such as aprons and mugs. They even offer art classes and special events!&lt;/p&gt;
