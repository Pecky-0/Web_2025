Charles, the owner/manager has been gracious enough to extend their regular happy hour until 8pm and offer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$0.50 off all drinks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your contact for this event is:&lt;br /&gt;Jeanie:  860-942-4708&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;PS: As some of you may be aware, Meetup charges for the hosting of a Meetup group, which runs about $70 for six months. We'll be bringing collection jar to this happy hour, and anything you can give towards defraying the cost of paying to keep the NHC going will be greatly appreciated!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Last week those who attended HH at Downtown at the Taft gave generously, we'll only harass those who were not at HH last week. As always, thanks so much for your support!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.
