If you're a new member, come out and meet the other members of our group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 8 p.m. at &lt;a href="http://www.rira.com/index.php?id=25" target="_blank"&gt;Ri Ra&lt;/a&gt;, as close to an Irish pub as you can get in RI. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so I can reserve a table, but if you decide to show up last minute, I'm sure we can find an extra chair. There's also live music starting at 10 pm, if you want to hang around for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Parking&lt;/span&gt;: There's a paid lot in front of Ri Ra. I think the garage to the right of the plaza is somewhat cheaper, and Ri Ra may validate. You can also park in the garage at Providence Place Mall and walk over.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask at hostess stand for RI Theatre Group</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266801216000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264971668000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meet &amp; Greet -- Ri Ra</name><id>12475930</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266627600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/12475930/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/5/global_12093749.jpeg</photo_url></item>
