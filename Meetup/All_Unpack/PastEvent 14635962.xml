The tour will take us from the Statue of Sam Adams in front of Faneuil Hall to the Blackstone Block, edging by the Haymarket vendors, through the Greenway and down Salem Street into the North End. We will learn about the history, geography and sociology of this area. The tour will end at about 2:30 in North Square. We will then proceed to lunch at Villa Francesca on Richmond Street.
