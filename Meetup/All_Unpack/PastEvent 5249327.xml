I'm hoping that by choosing a date and time this far in advance that we can get a large number of people to attend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot (so to speak) concerns an actress (Laura Dern) &amp;quot;whose personality becomes increasingly fragmented as she delves ever-deeper into her work for a high profile filmmaker (Jeremy Irons)&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, the obligatory positive review: &lt;a href="http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2557" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.slantmagaz...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as always, I'll be near the front row after the film,&lt;br /&gt;holding a sign. And then off to a local cafe or such to discuss afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165891668000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162862249000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>David Lynch's New Movie at The Brattle: Inland Empire</name><id>5249327</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165699800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5249327/</event_url></item>
