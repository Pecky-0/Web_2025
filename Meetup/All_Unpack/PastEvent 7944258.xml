Why not? &lt;br /&gt;If the wx doesn't work, we'll use Thursday as a back up.&lt;br /&gt;If we leave by about 5, we can enjoy a sunset flight back! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night's flight was awesome and seems we'll be doing more. Need a ride? Let's ee who's flying or back-seat-flying? Usually plenty of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KBAF" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We should all meet maybe at the runup area or better yet, taxi in front of the terminal and leave together...
