&lt;p&gt;O'Tooles is an excellent establishment with great food and delicious beverages. They hold a weekly trivia event every Wednesday and a group of us will be there this week putting the hurt on our craft rivals who have to gall to think they can beat us! Come join the excitement as we take first place with your help! Or you can just come to hang out and drink some good Irish beer. Either way, registration starts at 8:00, game starts promptly at 8:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew will Host, you can reach him by text: 508-524-9988&lt;/p&gt;

You also have the opportunity to win an additional $50 each night you come in 1st place so there's always a chance to win! ***********&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349963141000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349467740000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play Trivia at O'Tooles</name><id>85693482</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>8100000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349913600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/85693482/</event_url></item>
