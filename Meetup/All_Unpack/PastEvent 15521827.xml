Block Island has a great little restaurant right on the field at their new terminal.  Some members of our group have gone out to breakfast the last two weeks in a row and the flying has been nothing but perfect. If we left FIT by 8 we would return before noon. This is a great trip only 84.NM to do prior to our Nantucket stroll the following weekend. If you need a ride please say so on your RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;So don't forget to ask your loved one or a friend to join you. Your not going to want to miss this one and don't forget the camera.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like we will try to continue our Sunday AM Fly-outs, so please keep an eye out on the calendar. If anyone has suggestions on where they may want to go, please contact anyone of the organizers. We are always looking for new ideas and fun places to go. &lt;br /&gt;Gary  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.navmonster.com/map/KFIT-KBID-10" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.navmonster...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary Archer</member_name><member_id>6716312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291044630000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290392891000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Block Island, Sunday Morning Breakfast</name><id>15521827</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290949200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/15521827/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/7/global_13802791.jpeg</photo_url></item>
