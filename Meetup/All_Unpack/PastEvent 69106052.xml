The movie unpacks the facts about Nepal's Himalayan water resources and builds the case against big dams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film examines plans to build big dams in Nepal to export hydro-electricity to India and finds that the long-term hidden cost is potentially disastrous for both countries. The 45-min screening will be followed by a discussion on greater regional cooperation for water management throughout South Asia, with a focus on the recently revived River Linking Project in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary was produced by Andrew Majewski, who will be present for the screening and the subsequent discussion. Andrew is an independent documentary film-maker and made this movie in partnership with Nepali film-maker Gopal Koirala. &lt;br /&gt;
