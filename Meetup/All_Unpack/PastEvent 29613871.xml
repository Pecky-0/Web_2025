&lt;p&gt;Lovers of art, mysteries, prehistory, and the extraordinary films of Werner Herzog: prepare to be blown away by an unforgettable movie experience. Herzog's ever-curious spirit brings his audience along on his quest to film 30,000 year old paintings, discovered deep in the Chauvet Cave in southeastern
