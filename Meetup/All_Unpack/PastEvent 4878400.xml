<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is one of the best kept secrets in Boston.  Definitely a great place to meet up and lounge out before we head out to Vivid Lounge to bust a move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plan:  Meet around 8:30pm at Living Room (Atlantic Ave by Richmond St near Commercial Wharf).  We will be there till around 10pm or so, and then head out to Vivid Lounge (148 State St).  Please try to meet us at the Living Room, as Vivid can get crowded.  If you plan to head over to Vivid directly, give me a call before you arrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picture is on this site (6ft tall Asian guy shouldn't be too hard to find).  When you see the group, just introduce yourself and say you are a friend of Charlie.  If your picture is up on the site, do RVSP and I'll look for you as well. My phone is 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
