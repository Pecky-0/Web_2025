Estimate about 3 -  3 1/2 hours of hiking covering 5 - 6 miles and 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to relax and enjoy the picnic, which will be in the woods.  I would recommend packing your picnic lunch in a cold pack or with dry ice to keep it cold, since we'll be stopping for the picnic about halfway through our hike.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring bug spray and beverages....camera and binoculars if you have them, are great!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions that are on the web site are fine; only thing being that you have to look carefully for a &lt;u&gt;very small white sign&lt;/u&gt; on the turn off Route 97 - and again for the turn into the wildlife center, which is about another mile or so after you make that turn.  The address is &lt;i&gt;87 Perkins Row&lt;/i&gt; (not Perkins Lane).    The street numbers are odd - they go up and then back down again!  Just send me an e-mail if you have any questions.         &lt;br /&gt;         &lt;br /&gt;Please note that the sanctuary does charge a $4 per person entrance fee.  For those who wish to carpool, there is a convenient Park and Ride lot which is located at Exit 57 off Route 95, which is the Newburyport / West Newbury / Route 113 ramp.        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will look forward to seeing you then!           &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy          &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com         &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Once you turn left into the parking lot, go straight and turn right towards the back and look for a silver Subaru Forester.
