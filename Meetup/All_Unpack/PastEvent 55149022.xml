I believe the weather for the rest of the weekend is supposed to be decent as well. I've been climbing at a pretty decent outdoor spot, probably about 40ish' high, with about 10ish different anchors for top-roping. During the week, the person(s) I'm usually with and I are the only ones there. It's pretty awesome. My usual group's usual criteria for bearable (in regards to comfort) climbing is 45ish degrees when it's not windy, and 50ish when it's slightly windy. Basically, 57+ is an awesome temperature to climb outdoors at, and hopefully by at least Thursday, the bit of snow we accumulated will be melted. I'm looking to meet with anyone who'd be down to climb and has a rope and webbing. Extra locking biners and anchoring rope would be helpful. I have two locking biners and a bunch of non-locking ones, a quickdraw, my own harness, chalk bag, and shoes, and an ATC for belaying. I could find some anchoring rope for the belayer if there isn't any. We could switch off using my shoes if you have none and we're the sameish size. Send me a message or comment (I'm new to this site, don't know how it works) if some outdoor climbing this week at a non-busy/non-crowded park in unseasonably awesome weather interests you!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331270085000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331001338000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Climb Outdoors this Week (the 7th, 8th, and/or 9th and on) in Lawrence, MA</name><id>55149022</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1331233200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/55149022/</event_url></item>
