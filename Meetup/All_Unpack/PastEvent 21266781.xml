&lt;p&gt;True Red Sox Natives love to be outside during the longest days of our so short Boston summer. This is one of the best parties and wine tastings of the year in Boston. I rarely miss it and it sells out every year. Four years ago it sold out in&amp;nbsp;2 days! Purchase your $45.00 ticket now as you have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is Summer Solstice: the date in late June marking the first official day of summer and the years longest day of sunlight. And then there is Summer Solstice: the much anticipated annual Boston Uncorked roof deck wine soiree. Each celebrates the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Boston Uncorked for a sun and fun filled evening of fine wine, food and music at the Summer Solstice 7th Annual Roof Deck Wine Tasting at&amp;nbsp;The Sports Club LA&amp;nbsp;Roof Deck on Tuesday, June 28 from 6:45-9:00 pm.&amp;nbsp;Sample over 25 fine wines from producers all across the globe, paired with delectable bites&amp;nbsp;while enjoying&amp;nbsp;live jazz performed by Florencia Gonzales atop one of the city's hottest roof deck venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check In is 6:45pm. Event moves indoors&amp;nbsp;if inclement weather.&amp;nbsp;One must attend to experience it.

Yes RSVPs who have not purchased tickets before the event will be changed to no.&amp;nbsp;Arrive early.&amp;nbsp;www.bostonuncorked.com&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVPs with Tickets will be E Mailed Please Note VENUE CHANGE</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Red Sox Natives</member_name><member_id>12040580</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309359140000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307416524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Uncorked Summer Solstice 7th Annual Roof Deck Wine Tasting Sports Club LA</name><id>21266781</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309301100000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/21266781/</event_url></item>
