I am working working with a group of students for a class to build a business plan around a new product idea. Our product is a user-friendly water meter that attaches easily to household sinks, and let's the user know in real time, how much water he/she consumed. Your input would be greatly appreciated. Snacks and refreshments will be provided! Thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317583428000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Water &amp; Energy Tech.
