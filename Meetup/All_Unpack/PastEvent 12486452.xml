I was going to schedule it for the 12th but not sure if people have V-day plans for the weekend.  Peronally, I will most likely be sitting eating Chinese watching Two and a Half Men re-runs:-)  Hopefully this date and time works and maybe we can pow-wow about when and where to schedule the next shindig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping you can all attend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will do the same thing I always do- send out an email day of and let you know what I will be wearing:-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lisa</member_name><member_id>2136226</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268960575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fabulous Females</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore</urlname><id>1511961</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>South Shores' Fabulous Females Unite!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265054452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charlie Horse again!!!!!
