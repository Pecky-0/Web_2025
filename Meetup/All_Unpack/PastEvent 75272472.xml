Kane's Krusade is non profit organization that will be helping needy and misunderstood dogs (such as our beloved Bully's) in the Springfield Area. This day will be filled with food, vendors, raffles, games, and special visitors such as Lilly the Hero Pit Bull and Cherry Garcia (a rescue from the horrible Michael Vick ordeal.) and SO MUCH MORE!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admission is: $15 in advance and $20 at the door. Kids 12 and under are free with the purchase of an adult ticket. Please do not bring your dogs, they could only get permission to have these two very special dogs :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit Kane's Krusade on Facebook for more information or call 413-363-2101 if you have donations for the raffle or would like to be a vendor for this show! Everyone is welcome!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-mail me at melissa.kopec66@gmail.com for a copy of the flyer! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see all of you there!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345410885000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343483326000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>1st Annual Kane's Krusade Benefit/Cookout</name><id>75272472</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>61200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345348800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/75272472/</event_url></item>
