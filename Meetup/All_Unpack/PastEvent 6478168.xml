It is a restored mill, and the grounds include: a large waterfall, a small river with rapids, a small covered bridge, a medium sized dark pond, and the mill itself. All nestled in deep woods. The food is terrific, affordable (from sandwiches at about $8 up to full meals of about $20). Decor is casual, though the setting is quaint, very quaint. The place is so well known by the locals it has its own gift shop. Plan is to paint and have dinner around 4 or 5. Guests are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO MEET*: At the posted time, with 1/2 hour leeway for late-comers. The grounds are small and we can meet at the restaurant. If the weather is inclement you may choose to meet us for dinner only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: It's 45 minutes from Winchester. Take route 2 West to route 140 exit. You will see a sign shortly before the exit advertising the Mill. Off the ramp, take a left and you are there within 1/2 mile. It's around Fitchburg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER:&lt;br /&gt;            RSVPs: It's best to let us know you are coming so we can look for you or alert you to any changes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            THINGS TO BRING WHICH ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN: &lt;br /&gt;                        Mosquito repellant,  Paper towels,  Sweater, water, food&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            *LAX: We meet at the time above. You have 30 minutes additional slack, after which we may leave to the painting site without you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;            INCLEMENT WEATHER: It is up to you to determine if the weather makes painting untenable. Although, I will try to leave a message on my voice mail if I myself do not intend to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191956435000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191415327000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FALL PAINT &amp; PARTY: The Mill Restaurant, Westminster</name><id>6478168</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191693600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/6478168/</event_url></item>
