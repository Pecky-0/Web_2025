We have the world-renowned Daniel Vitalis coming to join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this potluck, he'll be discussing elixirs - what are they and how we can use them. Bring your questions and let's brainstorm together about how we can move into the cooler months - and better health! - using elixirs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info about Daniel, check out his website at &lt;a href="http://www.elixircraft.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.elixircraf...&lt;/a&gt;. He's also got some kick-ass vids on YouTube!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a raw vegan dish to share and come in comfy clothes. Additional guests are welcome! Fresh local spring water, iced herbal tea, dishes, cutlery, etc. will be provided. If you need directions, call or email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you're lucky, I'll make some raw vegan chocolate candy! Mmmmmm!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you have questions or need more info, call Lisa Marie at 207-423-5184 or email her at info@ritefoodandcompany.com.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256677854000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawmaine</urlname><id>1161576</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Raw Maine: The Way Food Should Be!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249850598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Potluck with Daniel Vitalis!</name><id>11071931</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256504400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawmaine/events/11071931/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/b/f/global_10110703.jpeg</photo_url></item>
