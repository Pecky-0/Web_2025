Learners of all levels, and native speakers welcome! &lt;br /&gt;This is an opportunity to meet with other learners and practice whatever you'd like to work on. Bring any books or homework you would like to review, and ask a native speaker to help you with pronounciation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully we will try  translate and read a song or poem or something in Chinese with ping ying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reece,  Adele and David.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- &lt;br /&gt;------------ &lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: (a member says that Mapquest directions are confusing) &lt;br /&gt;BCNC is at 38 Ash St., off of Oak St. between Washington St. and Harrison Ave. &lt;br /&gt;Oak St. is between Kneeland St. and Marginal Way (alongside the Turnpike)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest T stop is Orange Line New England Medical Center. &lt;br /&gt;Walk toward the South End (away from Chinatown) on Washington St and take the first left onto Oak St. The entrance to the building is in Ash St., the first small street on the left.
