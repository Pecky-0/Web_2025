There are a lot of you who are new to the group (or have joined but never made an event), and this is a great way for you to find out about our nightlife events and to meet other new members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar Lola has great atmosphere and they serve a wonderful selection of tapas, along with wine and sangria, of course!  This will be a very laid back, no agenda meetup - just good drinks (and food!) with good people.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most out of the nightlife group, I *STRONGLY* recommend new members to attend!  Also, feel free to bring a friend or two, and we will see you SUNDAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: Meeting time is 5pm at Bar Lola, and the event will last until 8pm.  If you come after 7pm, be sure to give me a call.  We will meet in the bar area at Bar Lola, which is on the right hand side of the restaurant when you first walk in.  If you have any problems finding the group, give me a call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVENT FEE:  Feel free to buy your hard working organizers a drink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site.
