Parking is on the street, so if you're not familiar with the area or think you might run into trouble, email me. I'll give you my cell phone number to call for suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP, and we'll see you there. Until then, happy coding.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Shearer</member_name><member_id>1529786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178233389000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>PHP Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>php-338</urlname><id>282097</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Providence PHP Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175645038000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence PHP Meetup May Meetup</name><id>5634812</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178060400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/php-338/events/5634812/</event_url></item>
