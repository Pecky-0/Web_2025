If you want to embarrass either of us endlessly, here's your chance!  Or just come to hear what our Medium has to say about the spirits we seek, and I get to show the evidence (or lack thereof) of a few of the sites we've been to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the venue, this has to be a charged event - $10 at the door - but it's worth every penny! Our last several lectures have gone very well, and a great time was had by all! Come support the Group!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at the podium!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244758438000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240583232000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spirits and Hauntings Lecture</name><id>10258707</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243810800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/10258707/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/1/global_2599441.jpeg</photo_url></item>
