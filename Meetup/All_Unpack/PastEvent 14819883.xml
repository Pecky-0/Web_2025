This campaign will be episodic with an over arcing story heavy on story, continuity and role playing. You do not need to have played in the first adventure to play in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to Great Crag raised more questions than it answered. What do the Daughters of Sora Kell want with Wileak, the elven scholar? Why was he kidnapped in the first place? Why was your group hired when there are perfectly good mercenaries all throughout Droaam? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sora Katra has summoned all of you, including Wileak, to the palace to discuss &amp;quot;a matter of great importance&amp;quot;. Since no sane creature refuses a request from the Daughters of Sora Kell, you prepare for a meeting that will hopefully shed some much needed light on all this shady business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Characters are now level 6. You are allowed one level 7 magic item, one level 6 magic item, and one level 5 magic item from the allowed books. You also have 1000 gold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the ONLY source material allowed to be used are the PHB, PHB 2, PHB 3, the Eberron Players Guide and Adventurer's Vault 1, be sure to check the errata for all books &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/updatesarchive" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You must take all races, classes, feats, and magic item choices from those books ONLY. This campaign will be cheddar-light. If you are looking for a min/max meat grinder, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Characters must be approved before Saturday, October 23rd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Regular attendance ensures you a spot at the final episode, which will take place at Templecon 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Players will treat everyone with respect and remember that the object of the game is for everyone to have fun, not just one person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Capping the group at 6 players, will run a second group if needed.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>11219434</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287942232000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284895070000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D 4th Edition 5th level Eberron campaign leading to TempleCon, Part 2</name><id>14819883</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287937800000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/14819883/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/4/7/global_17321703.jpeg</photo_url></item>
