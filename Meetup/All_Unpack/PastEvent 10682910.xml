Like Thai food? Want to find out if you like Thai food? Now's your chance. I've heard many good things about this restaurant and it's in a really neat location on a small alley off the Guilford Green. There is generally plenty of on street parking and there is a free parking lot behind the restaurant as well. After dinner we can head down to the Guilford Moorings for a sunset drink on their dockside Patio. Here are a few reviews: &lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g33798-d414585-Reviews-SOM_SIAM_Thai_Restaurant-Guilford_Connecticut.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tripadviso...&lt;/a&gt; , and of course a link to the restaurant so you can scope out the menu: &lt;a href="http://www.ctmenusonline.com/som_siam_thai_restaurant_ct.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ctmenusonl...&lt;/a&gt; . The Guilford Green is a nice place for a stroll if you arrive early. The restaurant is small so we are limited to 10 people, please RSVP early. I hope some of our new members make it and if this fills up quickly you can always catch up with us at the Moorings around 8:30-ish. See everyone soon.  Feel free to call me any time with questions at 802-233-9060.
