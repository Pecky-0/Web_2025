And it will be fascinating to see if the waitstaff has some new stories to tell us after 5 years of additional activity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly dinner meetings are primarily non-mandatory networking events. Although we talk business updates for half an hour and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, telling your own stories, etc. They're so we can all have a little unpressured time as a group. Because our regular place has closed down we are going back to our roots and will be choosing a different reportedly haunted location to meet at each month. Keep your eye on the meetup post for details. We look forward to you joining us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask at the bar!
