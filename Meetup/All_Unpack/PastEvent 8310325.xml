Come learn more and share ideas and a potluck meal with the group.  In addition to being an experienced gardener, Kiya is also a mushroom aficionado.  October might be a good time to see her mushroom growing efforts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open to all experience levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;House meetings typically go like this: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meet at 6:00 and start a tour of our member's home while we have daylight (try to arrive by or before 6:00 if you can so you don't miss anything our host has to tell us or miss questions from other members...) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the tour we hear about site &amp;quot;assets&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;challenges&amp;quot; and ask questions &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 6:45 or so we have a potluck supper, general conversation and then a bit of an agenda such as.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roundtable - introductions and thoughts about the property we viewed &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A summary of our best ideas for the member to use as they see fit &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;A few house keeping items, like upcoming events, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break up around 8:30. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see our Meetup Event RSVP Guidelines:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://permaculture.meetup.com/58/messages/boards/thread/5233158#20208623"&gt;http://permaculture.m...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event is full and you would like to get on the waiting list for an open spot, RSVP &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; with a comment that you'd like to get in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring your own potluck kit (plate/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin)!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224284481000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215649516000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Permaculture Meetup</name><id>8310325</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224021600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/8310325/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/1/global_3624513.jpeg</photo_url></item>
