[b]The Date and Theater are Confirmed, the time for the movie is 7:10. Patty and I will be in the back corner of the consession lobby where there are some seats! We will be there as early as we can get there. You can buy your tickets in advance, you never know how popular this will be. We will go for food and drinks after the movie.
