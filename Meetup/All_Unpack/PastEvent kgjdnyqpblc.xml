&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNOS again!  Yes, we have more of those free appetizer coupons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly dinner meetings are primarily non-mandatory networking events. Although we talk business updates for half an hour and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, telling your own stories, etc. They're so we can all have a little unpressured time as a group. Because our regular place has closed down we are going back to our roots and will be choosing a different reportedly haunted location to meet at each month. Keep your eye on the meetup post for details. We look forward to you joining us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie Roy</member_name><member_id>4599203</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354197452000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353097512000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>kgjdnyqpblc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354145400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/91706602/</event_url></item>
