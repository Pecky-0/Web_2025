This will be an educational trip, to give us an idea of how people lived by the Wheel of the Year, and also give a limited number of people an opportunity to make their own besom- (Please indicate on your RSVP if you are interested in doing this, as spaces for this are limited, and there will be a sign up sheet- each broom taking 15- 20 mins per person) We will also (weather permitting) bring a picnic lunch and if the New England Weather does not cooperate, we will have lunch at a nearby restaurant. The cost for admission is $15.00 per person (adult) as long as we have at least 20 people for the group rate, so please only RSVP if you truly plan on coming, because new rates are $25.00 per person if we are under that number.....
