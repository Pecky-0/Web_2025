Please read all details below and DO NOT hit reply or write directly.

I reserved 24 seats together on a first RSVP, first served basis via the FREE "CTNites.com VIP Entertainment Group" MeetUp online calendar reservation system:  &lt;a href="http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/734/calendar/" class="linkified"&gt;http://socialnetwork.meetup.com/734/calendar/&lt;/a&gt;

***

Rather than pay the $10-20 admission fee each time, almost everybody purchases a promo T-shirt (only $15) to gain admission to this and (almost) ALL WEDNESDAY performances for FREE by showing your promo T-shirt at the Box Office - FOREVER (whether attending as part of our irregularly scheduled group, or not).  Our group attends "Wacky Wednesday" at least twice per month - more often during colder months.  Such a deal!

After RSVP'ing "yes", simply show up and gather in the "Funny Bone" BAR @ 6:15 (AFTER picking up your FREE ticket from the Box Office by buying and/or showing your promo T-shirt - telling the Box Office you have a reservation through "Rob's Wacky Wednesday" group).  This will give us a chance to gather, have a drink, chat, and enter as a "group", thus allowing us to sit together as their policy is "first come, first seated".  Look for a group of 40/50-somethings wearing promo T-shirts and introduce yourself!  When the Club doors open at 6:30, THOSE PRESENT will enter together so we can be assigned good tables together and optionally have appetizers, dinner, drinks (no minimum; separate checks have been pre-approved) and get to know each other while waiting for the show to begin at 7:30 (lasting to @ 9:00).

&gt;&gt;&gt; If entering after 6:30, please ask the ticket taker to assign you a seat with, or nearest to, "Rob's Wacky Wednesday" group, if still available.

All (over 21) are welcome to join us!  Invite your friends and encourage them to join the "Single Event" www.TheSingleEvent.com and "MeetUp" www.MeetUp.com to be invited to these, and MANY MORE fun activities of all sorts!

Please MapQuest directions to:
194 Buckland Hills Drive, Manchester, CT 06042.

The "Funny Bone" is located within the Buckland Hills Mall, on the first floor, between JC Penney and Barnes &amp; Noble, via the external "Blue Turtle" entryway.

Funny Regards,

- Rob

*** FOLLOWING THE SHOW: Weather permitting, rather than go to a bar, we typically gather around a propane-fueled ceramic "Fire Pit" and listen to some music, dance, chat, tell jokes, gaze at the stars, or just relax with friendly company at a nearby outdoor location.  Directions will be provided at the show.  &lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; PLEASE BRING SOME SNACKS AND/OR BEVERAGES OF CHOICE TO SHARE and a beach chair or blanket for this casual, fun gathering.

Please visit or call the Box Office (860) 432-8600 for info regarding the FREE "Wacky Wednesday" T-Shirt promo and/or check their web site:
