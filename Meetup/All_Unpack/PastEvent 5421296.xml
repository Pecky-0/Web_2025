This  film from the MFA's African Cinema series  depicts  a filmakers odyssey as he meets brothers and sisters he was unaware of until his father's funeral. I am imagine this film will prove to be much more subtle and inciteful than the obviously over-the-top title. Here is the MFA's description: &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/calendar/event.asp?eventkey=26227&amp;amp;date=2/25/200" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mfa.org/ca...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is a short review from Nick Fraser Storyville Series Editor :  &lt;br /&gt;Filmmaker Dumisani Phakathi's father was, for most of his life, a talent scout for a soccer team. Throughout South Africa he was known as a minor celebrity. But at his funeral his son discovered another important piece of information - his father had enjoyed the company of 11 wives, with a total 52 children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dumisani's film is a cleverly juggled mixture of comedy and seriousness. He travels around visiting his siblings and they are as charming and as funny as he is. But there is a sombre side to this story of paternal goings-on, and this emerges in the very moving scenes when Dumisani's mother dresses up in the clothes she wore when she married his father. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the film, Dumisani begins to wonder in what ways he might or might not resemble his own father. How much of your absent and wayward father's characteristics can you really inherit? Stick through this entertaining film for its last few minutes - these are quite unexpected and very poignant&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As always, look for Tom near the front row after the movie holding a meetup sign and then off to a local cafe to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172590455000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169661754000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Best Movie Title of the Year???</name><id>5421296</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1172417400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5421296/</event_url></item>
