 I will supply the Coffee(caff and decaf),Tea, Juice,Bagles,Scones and Muffins.If anyone else would like to bring something please let me know what you intend to bring so we don't have to much of one thing.I would like for people to leave their dogs in the car for a brief time so we could come in the house have coffee and socialize prior to the walk. &lt;br /&gt;

 The hike is only about three miles long and goes through a wet area so make sure you bring footwear thats good for wet conditions.Halfway through the hike the trail opens up to an eleven acre field that the dogs can run and play in.My dogs love it.The hike would of course be contingent on the weather. If the weather is a factor.I would schedule it for a later date.Any feedback on this meetup would be welcomed.Thanks,Hank and Steve&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>stephen cordery</member_name><member_id>32328572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367075995000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364841572000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Annual?
