This week, we're trying something new.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's hard to set aside time to write when no one else holds us accountable. Let's help each other: bring your laptops or pen and paper (if that's your preferred method) and we'll have a working meetup, where we can all feed on collective creative energy and devote an hour and a half (at least!) to our writing independently. It's all fun and games talking about writing, but when it comes down to it, we really just have to sit down and DO it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as always, Blue Shirt Cafe is awesome to put up with us, and we should patronize them as much as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306282368000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291150161000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Writer's Meetup: Co-Work with Us</name><id>jqqxpyphbgc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306278000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/17106503/</event_url></item>
