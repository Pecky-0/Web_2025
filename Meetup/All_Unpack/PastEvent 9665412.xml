Originally designed by the H.H. Richardson's successor form, Shepley, Rutan &amp;amp; Coolidge, the South Station story is another inspiring example of saving the old from demolition to help interpret the new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now completely renovated for the 21st century, South Station still provides a glimpse into the past century of American history as it arrived and departed through this marvelous terminal. Come rediscover the age of the locomotive on this tour of South Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $15 ($5 for &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot card holders&lt;/a&gt;). The tour meets across the street from South Station near the Federal Reserve (tall silver building). About half the tour will be indoors so space is limited on this one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Boston By Foot badges, bags, hats, etc.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Justin Winsor</member_name><member_id>7593944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235850766000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233696310000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Station</name><id>9665412</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235329200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/9665412/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/1/global_7035441.jpeg</photo_url></item>
