<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have put together a fantastic Scenic Ireland trip! Four nights and five days in Dublin ...including airfare from NYC to Dublin, 4 nights lodging at a four star hotel. This package also includes a full Irish breakfast each day. All this for $629.00 dbl occ. (all taxes and departure fees included). What a bargain!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can arrange for sightseeing at an additional fee. All interested parties should respond ASAP to Terri ...203-808-5829. Or send me an email ...terri0417@yahoo.com. A $150.00 deposit is due with your reservation. Full payment will then be due in about a month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sightseeing, once a group has been established, we will meet and decide what sightseeing tours we would like to add. I will also keep this group to a maximum of 20 people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...this is indeed a bargain! But you must act soon to get this price!!! It is sure to sell out quickly. I look forward to hearing from interested parties...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will post additional information</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258897556000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>33</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244151508000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scenic Dublin, Ireland Trip...4 nts/5 days</name><id>10578229</id><headcount>31</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258059600000</time><rsvp_limit>34</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/10578229/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/4/b/global_8975963.jpeg</photo_url></item>
