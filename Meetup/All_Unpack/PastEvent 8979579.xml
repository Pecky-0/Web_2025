Registration starts at 1 PM and the walk starts at 2 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's more information at &lt;a href="http://www.cookandcare.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cookandcare.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cookandcar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;including a route map and a PDF form you can print out and use to solicit pledges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is organized by the Interfaith Cooperative Ministries (ICM), the organization that sponsors the Thanksgiving Dinners that many HAC members support each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the money raised during the walk will go to funding charitable works, the services will be delivered by ostensibly Christian organizations.  My understanding is that we cannot earmark the money for the least religious of the four beneficiaries as it all goes into a general pool.  Therefore, when considering whether to join us on the walk, you'll be forced to decide whether the benefit to the end users is worth supporting a religious intermediary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be walking as an HAC team and will have a t-shirt to indicate that fact.  (You'll need to pay for the shirt if you want one, about $10.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, a typical MS Walk offers two, five, and seven mile route options, so this three mile route should be achievable by even the most hardened couch potato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to sponsor one of the walkers, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be wearing white HAC t-shirts</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224609417000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224255606000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cook and Care Walk-A-Thon</name><id>8979579</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224435600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/8979579/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/global_5196186.jpeg</photo_url></item>
