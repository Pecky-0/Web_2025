For this 9:30 A.M. start you get to sleep in a little longer and have a easy / moderate hiking adventure climbing two peaks:&lt;br /&gt;Welch-Dickey Loop (2605 &amp;amp; 2734) &lt;br /&gt;Eighty percent of the trail features great views, a rarity in the wooded Northeast. Its one of those modest effort-great reward hikes.&lt;br /&gt;Route Level: &lt;br /&gt;Easy/Moderate&lt;br /&gt;Trail: &lt;br /&gt;We will make the loop counter-clockwise to allow for an easier return trip. From the trail head parking on Orris Road, we will follow the trail to the right, toward Welch Mountain. We will start heading uphill after about half a mile, then traverse flat, open ledges, amidst scrubby jack pine and dwarf birch, to reach the summit of Welch and views of Mad River and Campton Meadows. Note: a few rock scrambles will be encountered on this section. We will then drop back into the woods before continuing up and over more exposed ledge to the summit of Dickeys summit. After a great ridge walk, with one stunningly sheer drop-off, we will descend to a logging road for the final hike out.&lt;br /&gt;Time/Distance: &lt;br /&gt;4.5-mile loop, We will take are time to enjoy the views, eat, take pictures and just have fun (Probably 4.5 to 5 hours).&lt;br /&gt;Weather Note: &lt;br /&gt;Rain can cancel this hike. Rock slabs can be slippery when wet, so if you sign up, please keep in touch. We want to safely hike the many open slab crossings found on the Mt. Welch &amp;amp; Mt. Dickey Loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer &lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the Disclaimer and things you must know&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>A black four door toyota echo with Maine License Plates.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224934923000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218476574000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Welch-Dickey Loop </name><id>8521786</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224423000000</time><rsvp_limit>32</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/8521786/</event_url></item>
