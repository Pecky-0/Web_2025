Dogs are welcome if they are leashed on the narrow trail portions of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;

I expect the hike to be 2+ hours and five mile range if walking conditions are good.  If there is enough snow, we can make it a snowshoe hike and I will adjust the hike route accordingly.  I will send out a follow-up note several days prior to the hike.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill Vickstrom</member_name><member_id>11406046</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359992826000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1358822017000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February First Sunday Hike</name><id>100761612</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359914400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/100761612/</event_url></item>
