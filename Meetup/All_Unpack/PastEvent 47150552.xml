Do not fret, old FAN Alliance has a solution. Its called a Chocolate Buffet. We will have a meet and greet, lots of chocolate and games, some party games, some stategy games. There should be a little something for everyone. If this does not describe you and you are planning to celebrate on the real Valentines Day, come on over anyway! This is a potluck, so bring over your favorite main dish, appetizer or dessert with some chocolate in it. I will email directions to those who RSVP YES.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329267311000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325996485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Third Annual Valentines Chocolate Potluck: Meet, Greet &amp; Games</name><id>47150552</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329001200000</time><rsvp_limit>28</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/47150552/</event_url></item>
