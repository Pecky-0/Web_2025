We decided as a group to plan a photo event that would represent a high fashion, luxury product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will locate an up and coming fashion designer with an evening collection and help them build their look book by creating dynamic concept images that best portray their fashions. The setting will be in a luxury home or on a boat/yacht. The timeframe to take place in spring with an anticipated date in April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivo will head as the photograper for this event and will work with me to define 3-4 suitable locations for the event. Once the locations have been identified, we will present to the team to finalize the location. Ivo will also be in charge of lighting and mood elements of this photo campaign. &lt;strong&gt;Ivo will bring images of the types of locations that would be ideal and discuss lighting/mood concepts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caitlin will be instrumental in determining the fixtures and backdrops for the shoot. She will also work to secure the props needed. Caitlin will work with Ivo to concentrate on color schemes and details pertinent to the setting. &lt;strong&gt;Caitlin will present images of&amp;nbsp;her ideas for props and backgrounds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krista will be the fashion stylist for this event. Her first task is to develop a list of potential designers. We will narrow the list to 5 and will determine the one with whom we will work for this project. Important aspects of this determination include current and upcoming collections in addition to garment&amp;nbsp;quality and ability to&amp;nbsp;present a complete&amp;nbsp;evening/cocktail/formal collection necessary for the photosession. &lt;strong&gt;Krista will present collection images and information about 1-2 potential designers she likes so far&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natasha will be responsible for the models once selected. And will assist Krista&amp;nbsp;with dressing and styling for the event. She will also assist Krista with designer research. Natasha will co-present with Krista on designer update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiki will design 3 nail&amp;nbsp;art concepts and the team will select one that will&amp;nbsp;compliment the collection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Kiki will present at least 2 initial nail art design concept ideas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorrie&amp;nbsp;will organize and coordinate this event and work with the team&amp;nbsp;to design and execute a successful event.&amp;nbsp;She will also book the model selection event;&amp;nbsp; design the makeup and hair for the photo session; and work as the accessories stylist. &lt;strong&gt;Lorrie will bring inital image and sketch concepts of makeup/hair and accessories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;We can certainly use a few additional team members as we work on this project. If interested please &lt;strong&gt;RSVP&lt;/strong&gt; and join us for this exciting planning session.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this meeting we will further present our concept ideas with images, drawings in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you February 11, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
