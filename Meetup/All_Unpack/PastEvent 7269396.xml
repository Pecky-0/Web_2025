I'd plan on them playing at 10pm to be safe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The barflies are typically a duo featuring Mike Hermans on Guitar, George Chinaglia on Bass. &lt;br /&gt;They do have a vocalist on occasion when they play too. &lt;br /&gt;They play primarily top 40 rock and blues tunes from artists like Stevie Wonder, Asia, the Beatles and the Police for example.  &lt;br /&gt;Stop in for a drink and relax  for awhile at the Solas on a tuesday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested the Solas serves food till 10pm I believe, not a bad place to get a bite to eat before the show. There is also good Mexican food, and other dinning choices close by.&lt;br /&gt;If there is enough interest we could make plans to get something to eat either at the Solas or elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me if your interested in gettting something to eat before the show.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to Meetup with some of you there. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E-mail me if you have any questions...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Solas is a small venue.
