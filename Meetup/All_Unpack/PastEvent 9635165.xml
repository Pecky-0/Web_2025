It's the perfect place to meet before a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll first meet at TGI Fridays for light bites, or choose to enjoy a full dinner.  Whatever your preference!  The Movie to follow is at Regal Cape Cod Mall Stadium 12,  793 Route 132, Hyannis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My suggested movie to go see is:&lt;b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;New in Town&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; staring Renée Zellweger.&lt;/b&gt;  It starts at&lt;b&gt; 7:50 p.m. Runtime:1 hr. 36 minutes.  Movie price:  $8.50&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hill (Renée Zellweger) is an ambitious, up and coming executive living in Miami. She loves her shoes, she loves her cars and she loves climbing the corporate ladder. When she is offered a temporary assignment - in the middle of nowhere - to restructure a manufacturing plant, she jumps at the opportunity, knowing that a big promotion is close at hand. What begins as a straight forward job assignment becomes a life changing experience as Lucy discovers greater meaning in her life and most unexpectedly, the man of her dreams (Harry Connick, Jr.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;  If any of you ladies would prefer to see a different movie for yourself, I'll bring a movie list with showtimes to Fridays, or you can look it up on the internet at:  &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com/02601_movietheatershowtimes?date=2/5/2009" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fandango.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;  If you want to just make the lite bites at TGI Fridays and not attend a movie that's fine too!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Infamous Pink Hat!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharon</member_name><member_id>8235187</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234567229000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
