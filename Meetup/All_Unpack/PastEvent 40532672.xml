&lt;p&gt;This is an easy paced hike with the summit being optional. We will impose a 1pm turn around time to insure that we will return before dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dress in layers and pack for cold weather possible ice on the rocks. Headlamp and batteries. Food and hydration for 8-10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the entire East Ridge of Mt. Monadnock, the Pumpelly (pum-PELL-ly) Trail presents the gentlest direct trail up the mountain. Of course, there's a price: It's by far the longest trail, covering about 4 miles (6.4 km) from the trailhead to the summit. Because the Pumpelly Trail stays on the East Ridge, it maintains a generally unintimidating slope (11% overall). While this is occasionally broken by steep sections, compared with the typical ascents on the mountain, it's not very difficult, and the gentler climb means you can ascend fairly quickly on this route&amp;mdash;maybe only 50% longer than the trails that are half as long. Virtually the entire upper half of the trail is above tree line, though infrequent evergreens add some interest. The lower half is generally hardwood mixed with evergreens. The upper trail is almost always over bare rock. With nothing to interfere, the views are generally uninterrupted and beautiful. In hot weather, though, you are unprotected from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trail can be deceiving.&amp;nbsp; It's difficulty rating is 2, but it's also ranked as a the second hardest trail (2) on the mountain by park personnel, second only to the Spellman Trail.&amp;nbsp; Why? Well, the trail itself isn't particularly difficult.&amp;nbsp; There is one stretch that is fairly steep, but it's not especially long. The average slope isn't steep, only 11%, the gentlest on the mountain.&amp;nbsp; But the trail is also the longest on the mountain, eight miles round trip, and taking six to seven hours to complete for many people.&amp;nbsp; The risk on this trail is that it can be underestimated.&amp;nbsp; It's easy to take this trail and not bring enough food or water and find yourself weak from hunger or suffering dehydration. Add into it that a very long piece of the trail is exposed to the sun and weather, and things begin to add up. And the sheer length of the trail can sap the strength of someone who's not ready for this long of a trail on a mountain. Of course, a regular hiker might not find this trail especially challenging, but the occasional hiker may be unpleasantly surprised! Don't let this apparently gentle trail fool you.&lt;/p&gt;
