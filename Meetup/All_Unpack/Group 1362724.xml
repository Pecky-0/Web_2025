Come to a Photography Meetup to talk about the latest gear, swap tips and techniques, share your images and stories -- and have fun doing it! Professionals and Amateurs all welcome. It's a friendly environment to help educate anyone interested in learning more about photography. Professionals are asked to volunteer their knowledge and time to help further the enjoyment and passion for photography to all those interested. Each meeting will revolve around one camera/shooting/visual concept and explore that piece only that day. So bring your cameras and make some friends!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.77</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1232481047000</created><lat>41.5499992371</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>206</id><urlkey>digcam</urlkey><name>Digital Photography</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>223</id><urlkey>photo</urlkey><name>Photography</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10415</id><urlkey>videographer</urlkey><name>Videographer</name></topics_item></topics><name>Connecticut Photography Group</name><id>1362724</id><members>487</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>8713251</member_id><name>Jerome Braga</name></organizer><urlname>shootout</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/1/6/600_7115606.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/1/6/highres_7115606.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>7115606</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/1/6/thumb_7115606.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Middletown</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/shootout/</link><lon>-72.6600036621</lon></item>
