Please join my hike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll need car spotting since this is through-hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Car Spotting Plan:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  We'll meet at 8AM at the Parking Lot of  Nineteen Mile Bk Trail TH on Rt 16 for car spotting.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone come here first.  Then, we leave some cars here and drive the rest of cars to the parking lot of Glen Boulder Trail TH on Rt 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hiking Plan:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;HIKE-IN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* We'll start hiking no later than 8:20AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 2.0 Miles  Reach to E Peak via Wildcat Ridge Tr&lt;br /&gt;* 0.3 Miles  Reach to Wildcat D via Wildcat Ridge Tr &lt;br /&gt;* 1.8 Miles  Reach to Wildcat Mtn via C Peak, B Peak on Wildcat Ridge Tr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;HIKE-OUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 0.7 Miles  Wildcat Ridge Tr (This is very steep section descent!)  &lt;br /&gt;* 3.6 Miles  Nineteen Mile Bk Trail to come back to the car spotting loc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total hiking mileage is &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;approximately 8.5 miles&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;It will take about 6 hours if we keep 1.5 mph hiking pace.  If there are a lot of snow on the trails and if we have to break trails, it may take more time to complete the hike, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll bring Microspikes for hiking, but, just in case, I'll bring crampons and snowshoes in the car as well.&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to expect hikers who join do trial research before joining my hike and prepare adequate gear for winter hike.  I may not allow unprepared hikers to join my hike at the hiking start point.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to meeting/hiking with you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Organizer,&lt;br /&gt;Tomoko Nakajima&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My Car is Honda CR-V (Blue) w/ VT green plate</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tomoko</member_name><member_id>8122788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293169534000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291697415000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wildcat Range Hike - Wildcat (4422 ft) &amp; Wildcat D (4062 ft).</name><id>15664496</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292763600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/15664496/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/c/6/global_20099318.jpeg</photo_url></item>
