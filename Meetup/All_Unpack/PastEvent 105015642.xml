&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;Showtime is 6:15.  I will be at the theater by 5:15 and we will head in for seats at 5:45.  &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I arrive at the theater an hour before the show to start gathering people, and we head in for seats about 30 minutes before the show, so we can sit together. This also allows us to take turns getting snacks, etc., before the previews start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993366"&gt;I encourage everyone to consider buying your tickets in advance.  We see most movies on opening weekend and they do often sell out.   Fandango.com is the site that this movie theater uses.  Be warned though, there are sometimes hiccups to the system, especially the mobile app.  Not being able to complete a transaction does not mean they are sold out.  Please do not post a comment to the site that the movie is sold out.   Zip me an email and I will check it out.  If it is indeed sold out, I will let people know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group ahead of time, come find us after. We gather in the hallway outside of the theater we just saw the movie in, to discuss the film a bit, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who would like to go out after for drinks and munchies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;$$$$Managing the after event is much easier if everyone brings cash, so please plan ahead if you want to go out with the group after.$$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
