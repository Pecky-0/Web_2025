The Cheney family built this railroad in 1869 with their own funds to connect their South Manchester silk mills to the main line in the North End. We'll walk about 3 miles all together, most of it on property owned by the Manchester Land Conservation Trust. The terrain is bumpy, but not too hilly. Children will receive a free railroad patch. There are no restrooms. No dogs, please, as this is part of the CT Forest &amp;amp; Park Association's Family Rambles program, but all, including, singles are very welcome. Meet behind 2 Main St., Manchester, CT 06042. Please park at the nearby shopping area or at the Eighth Utilities office building (not in the parking lot of Farr's sport shop). In addition to the walk, there will be commentary on the history of the railroad and vintage photos. Free. Extreme weather cancels, but we'll go if it's just light rain.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will have a clipboard and vintage railroad photos.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278992231000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271151930000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>June 26 Cheney railroad walk </name><id>13167885</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277571600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/13167885/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/f/global_10030703.jpeg</photo_url></item>
