parking fee unless you have a season pass for MA state parks. MA
residents age 62+ can get a free pass. Easy to moderate hike on the
Overlook Trail.....approximately 1 1/2 hours but can find some
other trails if we want to hike longer or all day if we want to;-).
There are several trails including the M&amp;amp;M Trail. Also if you'd
like to bring a picnic lunch in a cooler, there are tables near the
pond and parking area. This is a gorgeous place. Much to do..a nice
baseball ball field, horse shoe pits, dog friendly, kid friendly.
We could do a summer gathering, barbecue and potluck maybe if
enough responses and no rain...grrr. There are two pavilions but
need enough responses before inquiring about one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308492902000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307667039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wendell State Forest hike, picnic or barbecue after.</name><id>21666101</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308405600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group/events/21666101/</event_url></item>
