Mindfulness practice is ideal for cultivating greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as of the ways the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and spiritual health. The mind is known to be a factor in stress and stress-related disorders, and meditation has been shown to positively effect a range of autonomic physiological processes, such as lowering blood pressure and reducing overall arousal and emotional reactivity. The program brings meditation and yoga together so that the virtues of both can be experienced simultaneously. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The MBSR program started in the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in 1979 and is now offered in over 200 medical centers, hospitals, and clinics around the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group will meet on 5 consecutive Mondays, starting April 4th at 8- 9:45pm at the Art &amp;amp; Soul Yoga: &lt;a href="http://www.artsoulyoga.com/Art_%26_Soul/Home.html" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.artsoulyoga.com/Art_%26_Soul/Home.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
