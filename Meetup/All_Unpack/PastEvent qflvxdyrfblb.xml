Get on this once a month program! This class is designed to wring the body of any harmful toxins that accumulate in the body, over time, through the environment and food we eat. Come prepared to sweat as we spend 45 minutes moving from posture to posture, including many twists in our practice. We will spend another 15 minutes doing seated and lying twists to finish wringing out the remaining toxins in the spine and organs. Class will end with a 15 minute Savasana (relaxation) re-settling and assimilating the cleansing work that was done as well as purging any negative thoughts we may have about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>7474519</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362791018000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Yogis</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Yoga-Safe-Haven</urlname><id>1527369</id><group_lat>43.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6699981689</group_lon><name>Yoga Safe Haven</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355104827000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yoga for Detox</name><id>qflvxdyrfblb</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>5400000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362785400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Yoga-Safe-Haven/events/106449872/</event_url></item>
