<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Our weekly meeting is a regular opportunity for members to discuss their writing projects, to socialize, and to share recent work for feedback. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Please bring copies of whatever recent drafts you'd like the group to discuss, and feel free also to bring any new publications or periodicals you think we'd profit from knowing about. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 New members are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Try to look at picture of organizer or ask at the front desk of cafe- they usually know who we are!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340759511000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340234568000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Poetry Tuesday Salon - Central Square</name><id>dwcvbdyqjbjc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1340748000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/70039772/</event_url></item>
