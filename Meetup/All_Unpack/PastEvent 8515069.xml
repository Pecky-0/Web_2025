<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Several members have expressed interest in doing altered books. This subject takes some time, so I will be scheduling the next two or three meetups around this topic. For our first meeting, we will discuss some general ideas and possibilities for altered books. Please bring one book you would like to work on. If you have done altered books in the past, please bring them along to share. I have several books on the topic we can use as reference as well. We will work on our books for approximately two hours in the meetup. We can then work on our projects between this meeting and the next, and then add some additional touches at the next meeting and share what we have learned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post a suggested supply list in a message thread. Please feel free to contribute thoughts, ideas, or web links to the thread.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go in the front door, up the stairs to the second floor.
