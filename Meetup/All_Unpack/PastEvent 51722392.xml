This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in and around Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Chapel Grille in Cranston, RI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can hear your gears turning... I know what you're thinking. But, before you get up in arms about how far away it is, let me assure you that the 10/15 minute drive from Providence is worth it! This former church turned restaurant is an architectural beauty, with taste and charisma to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just opening in December, they caught the eye of the Providence Monthly who wrote a very flattering review:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff ; text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://providenceonline.com/stories/Dining-Review-Chapel-Grille-Cranston-Providence-Monthly,782?category_id=31&amp;amp;town_id=1&amp;amp;sub_type=stories,packages,photos"&gt;Providence Monthly - Chapel Grill Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've been nice enough to agree to reserve their loft area for us. This upstairs loft is the best seat in the house with views of the grand cathedral roof line above and stocked bar below. It seems like a place any Rhode Islander "in the know" should know about, so let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephanie</member_name><member_id>8926850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329511836000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328815163000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Meetup - Chapel Grille</name><id>51722392</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329174000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/51722392/</event_url></item>
