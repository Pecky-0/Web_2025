We can eat at the cafe after the kayaking for lunch. Kayak or canoe rentals by the hour. Single kayak - $15, double kayak - $20, large &amp;amp; long canoe - $25. Life jckets and paddles are provided. Beginners are welcome and this part of the river is calm and wonderful for sightseeing. I will need a head count for rentals ASAP so I can call in and reserve. If you are to rent they only take cash! You can also bring your own. It is suppose to be a beautiful day so hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathy </member_name><member_id>8880932</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318252916000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317742011000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kayak the Charles River</name><id>36093992</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318082400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/36093992/</event_url></item>
