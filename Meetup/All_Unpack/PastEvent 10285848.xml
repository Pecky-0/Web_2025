We'll meet on the 30th so as not to conflict with Memorial Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's fun to hang out in this interesting part of town, sip an iced latte, and talk books with other bookish people.  New members are always welcome! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the agenda is our regular book-themed schmoozing and smorgasbord of bookcrossing-registered books. (&lt;a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bookcrossi...&lt;/a&gt;) This location has free wi-fi, so if you forget to register your books or you're not sure how, you can register them on the spot. (Bringing books is optional.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have a pile of books on the table &amp; a small sign with the Ballycumber logo</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liz</member_name><member_id>220016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244589485000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240937880000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Bookcrossing May Meetup -- Saturday Chapter</name><id>10285848</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243706400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/10285848/</event_url></item>
