<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Can there be any argument that understanding the mind can only be achieved by the methods of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; science and art? Well, I’m being facetious because as we all know philosophers can argue about anything. But it seems to me that it takes both science and art to grasp the workings of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, neuroscience and related disciplines continue to make remarkable progress in the understanding of the brain and, regardless of any metaphysical ideas that you may have concerning minds or a transcendent Mind the science of the brain has to be accorded center stage when claims are made about the nature of mind. But consider the artistry of what we call the mind. Innovative ideas and the notion of consciousness, not to mention the mind-boggling work that is the essence of art displays a kind of knowing that, in my view, science in and of itself is unable to put its finger on. An artist or a creative thinker works in a realm that—while it may be ultimately explainable by science, may also not be truly understandable by science because the artist or the creative genius may work with principles and creative insights that are beyond its expressive potential. In a sense, a great artist is a great scientist of the mind (I don’t think that I exaggerate, but I’m sure many others will feel that I do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not too much acquainted with the work of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergson"&gt;Henri Bergson&lt;/a&gt; but, from what I know, I think that my thinking about the mind may find accordance with his thought (so I plan to read some of his work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, my point is that the creativity of an Albert Einstein or a Leonardo da Vinci points towards a knowledge of the mind that transcends the lab. So, in this discussion we will discuss the science and the artistry of mind and examples of differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMAT:&lt;/strong&gt; When both big round tables are used, a designated half of each will move to the other table at approximately 8:45 pm in order to encourage mixing between the tables (each table accommodates up to 13 people).   After all, our events are as social as they are intellectual, and this format encourages the flourishing of both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOOD AND BEVERAGES:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This restaurant is extremely accommodating and allows us to stay until closing (11:00pm) if we choose.  It is not fair if they are not fairly compensated&lt;/em&gt;.  And we use a large percentage of the total seats in the house! The basic cost is $20 (this covers your entree, 3 or 4 shared appetizers per table, tax and gratuity but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; drinks). &lt;strong&gt;DRINKS ARE ORDERED AND PAID FOR SEPARATELY BY EACH ATTENDEE&lt;/strong&gt;. If on a &lt;em&gt;rare&lt;/em&gt; occasion you only order a drink or an appetizer, or if you do not order anything, then you will owe a minimum charge of $12 to compensate the restaurant for their service.  If there should be a shortfall, which is unlikely, then the group agrees to chip in to cover the difference. &lt;em&gt;By attending this event you hereby agree to this policy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes some of us head out for a late night prolongation of the evening at a nearby pub.  However, during these occasions please do not carpool to the pub: drive your car down the street and re-park it at the pub because there is TOWING after the little mall area closes for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you RSVP for one of our events it is expected that you have every intention of attending. Please refrain from impulse reservations and impulse cancellations!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
