About the movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Set in South Carolina in 1964, the tale of Lily Owens, a 14-year-old girl who is haunted by the memory of her late mother. To escape her lonely life and troubled relationship with her father, Lily flees with Rosaleen, her caregiver and only friend, to a South Carolina town that holds the secret to her mother's past. Taken in by the intelligent and independent Boatwright sisters, Lily finds solace in their mesmerizing world of beekeeping, honey and the Black Madonna.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 6:40, so let's meet by 6:15 right outside the theater (or just inside the doors if Jack Frost is nipping). Then we can go get our discounted tickets ($8.50 for FMM members and their guests -- exact  change makes me like you more) and get snacks and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests are always welcome, but please just make sure to include them in your RSVP so I know how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you this Thursday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell phone number, if you're late or need directions or have a last-minute RSVP:&lt;br /&gt;508-308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227142797000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226348942000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Secret Life of Bees</name><id>9133773</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226618100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/9133773/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
