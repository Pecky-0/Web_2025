<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Last minute, I can't make Saturday's Mt Pierce hike. The description is the bascically the same though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.4 miles RT. Book time is 4:25, but book time means diddly-squat in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's winter in the Whites, you need to be prepared: 10 Essentials + full winter gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider me to be a Social Coordinator, not a guide. You need to be fully prepared for this hike on your own, including all maps, directions, gear, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like there will be significant fresh snow on Sunday. This is a popular trail, but don't count on it being broken out. My last winter hike it took us 3 hours to go less than 2 miles since we were breaking trail through 1 to 2 feet of snow most of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will agree to a turn-around time before leaving the trailhead, and will turn back if the conditions warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is optional. Returning to the trailhead is mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
