introduction to the mindfulness of breathing meditation this coming Saturday at Nagaloka. The mindfulness of breathing meditation uses the breath as the object of concentration. By focusing on the breath we can become aware of what’s going on in our minds. This brings us to the present moment helping to bring a calm, peaceful state of being and helps us to let go of restlessness and anxiety. A wonderful way to relax along with having a positive effect on one’s entire physical and mental state. Suggested donation is $20-$45 for the morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367082937000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366751821000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mindfulness of Breathing Meditation </name><id>115828942</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367071200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/115828942/</event_url></item>
