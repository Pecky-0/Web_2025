Whether you're a wanna be like myself, or have a clan heritage linking right back to the moors, we're off to experience the culture, music and athletics of the New Hampshire Highland Games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located at Loon Mtn the weekend of September 21-23, this is an opportunity to catch some amazing music, check out some sheepdog trials, and watch men in kilts lift heavy rocks and throw things.  Don't worry, these particular fellas DO wear something underneath:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a taste of the happenings (and to see the planned events and costs) explore their website at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhscot.org/index.php?id=13&amp;amp;tpl=default" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhscot.org...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day pass costs vary depending on the day.
