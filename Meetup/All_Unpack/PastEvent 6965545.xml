There is a building and a metal &lt;br /&gt;Guard rail there if you try to drive out that small&lt;br /&gt;Drive way.   I would recommend going back out&lt;br /&gt;Via the Medical Center Parking Lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some parking on Orchard Street, then you can&lt;br /&gt;Walk to Center Street &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The businesses are from right to left facing that side&lt;br /&gt;169/ Mia Boutique, Edeen Attorney, Ecuama, Jakes?s Tavern,&lt;br /&gt;Medical Center and some Reality Co.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two doors into the Tavern from Center Street, &lt;br /&gt;but I went in the door to the Left into the bar area.&lt;br /&gt;Go towards the back of the Tavern where there is a&lt;br /&gt;Large lounge area with a Big TV Screen.&lt;br /&gt;That is where the Band will be playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did reserve a table in my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members of Coffee Talk &lt;br /&gt;Meet Up Group are welcome to come&lt;br /&gt;Listen to some music from the 1970s to 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did ask and coffee is served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be alcohol served, so those that cannot be near alcohol&lt;br /&gt; are requested not to attend this Meet Up but join us at our&lt;br /&gt;Other Coffee meet ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading up Wallingford history,  Jakes Tavern was one of the locations&lt;br /&gt;Used in A.D. Calvo film of The Other Side of the Tracks.   &lt;br /&gt;I never saw the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Connecticut" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Connecticut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some members at Jakes to hear some rock and roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This depends on the weather.&lt;br /&gt;This Meet Up will be cancelled if there is a heavy&lt;br /&gt;Snow Storm or Ice Storm.  Members Safety comes first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably take I 91 N to Exit 13 to &lt;br /&gt;Right on Rte 5 to Right on 150 / Center Street.&lt;br /&gt;I used to work in that area years ago and that is the&lt;br /&gt;Way that I am more comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have members in or near Wallingford who have been&lt;br /&gt;Asking us to have events in or near Wallingford.&lt;br /&gt;This event is one of many recent events that we are having&lt;br /&gt;in or near Wallingford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A member of the band is a member of Unknown Zone,&lt;br /&gt;so this is a joint Meet Up with the Unknown Zone members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://conspiracy.meetup.com/83/"&gt;http://conspiracy.mee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conspiracy.meetup.com/83/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Organizer of Coffee Talk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer of Greater New Haven Unknown Zone&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We have a table reserved in my name in the lounge in the back where the band will be playing.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200971944000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Relax to some Rock and Roll</why><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198581452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fugitives in Wallingford</name><id>6965545</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200792600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/coffee-397/events/6965545/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/5/global_2762549.jpeg</photo_url></item>
