&lt;p&gt;Please join us for a night of games and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be bringing a selection of games for people to choose from, but if you have a specific game you would like to try please message me and if I have it we will try and get it on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latecomers are welcome, but please let me know what time you plan on arriving so I can try and have a game ready for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at the game night I would like to start a discussion on what days would be good for the next few Meetups. The library has provided me with some dates that the room will be open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Meetup will go until 8:30pm. After the meetup I ask that people please help put the tables away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you there, and as always if you have any questions please feel free to send a message!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hilton Garden Inn Room - 2nd Floor Ask for Wayne</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Wayne</member_name><member_id>1411667</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1302689997000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>sagesofrpg</urlname><id>747276</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth, NH / Seacoast Boardgames Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1300236585000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Community Game Night at the Portsmouth Public Library</name><id>16936751</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1302213600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sagesofrpg/events/16936751/</event_url></item>
