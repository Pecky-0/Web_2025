&lt;p&gt;Our regular room is booked for this time. So I changed it to &lt;strong&gt;Bangalore Room on the 4th Floor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Boston study groups now, so how about one in Cambridge too? My office building in Kendall Square is generously offering the use of their conference room for our language group for free. So let's give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People of all levels of fluency are welcome. Please feel free to bring any study materials to share with the group. After the meetup, if enough people are interested, we can walk over to a local restaurant for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HOW TO GET THERE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get here is to use the T. The office building is right next to the Red Line Kendall Square stop, across street from the Microsoft building. You can exit from the east end after you get off the train. &lt;span&gt;For directions from Red Line Kendall/MIT station to the CIC building, please see&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2363702/direction_to_CIC.jpg"&gt;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2363702/direction_to_CIC.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you are in the lobby, please show your ID to the receptionist for a visitor's pass. Then take the elevator to the 4th Floor. There will also be a sign on the door with directions and a phone number. You can use the lobby phone to call me to open the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you drive, you can park at the Garage (hourly parking) attached to the building. Street parking nearby is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
