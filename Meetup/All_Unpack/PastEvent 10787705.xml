<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This private preserve was created by the will of former Governor and Senator George McLean.  He wanted to preserve a place where trees and wildlife can grow unmolested by hunters and wood choppers.  Now we have some 3,400 acres of woodlands, meadows and streams to enjoy.  There are many miles of trails.  We will sample one of the popular loops that lead to the top of a mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 2 miles with average hills.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  Rain cancels.  Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  170 Salmon Brook St, Granby, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=170+salmon+brook+st,granby,ct&amp;amp;sll=41.943596,-72.79335&amp;amp;sspn=0.010534,0.017896&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.945862,-72.793007&amp;amp;spn=0.010533,0.017896&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248197956000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246539993000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>McLean Game Refuge Walk, Granby, CT</name><id>10787705</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248024600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/10787705/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
