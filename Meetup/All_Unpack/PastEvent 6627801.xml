Let's show them som e thanks and also make this a better event for everyone (maybe the national media will pick up on this) that Ron Paul supporters are serious about the revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198023053000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193513828000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Tea Party Re-enactment</name><id>6627801</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197849600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6627801/</event_url></item>
