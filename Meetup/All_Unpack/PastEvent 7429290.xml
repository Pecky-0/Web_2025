At 7pm we will get rolling with the main event for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the main event:   Using NLP without calling it NLP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NLP is amazingly effective, but is sometimes limited by its very name.  When people hear NLP, or the full name, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, or even worse, some of our jargon (well-formed outcomes, trans-derivational search, nominalizations, etc) they can go running for the exits.  It is very useful to be able to use NLP with calling it NLP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Thursday, I will take you through a short personal development workshop I created called Superhero Training (see the description at the end of this message).  It will take between 60 and 90 minutes, and then we will dissect the workshop to show how NLP is at the core. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you?ve been wanting to introduce friends, neighbors, family or colleagues to NLP, this would be a good session to bring them to.  I?ve given the Superhero workshop to many audiences, and they unanimously found it both fun and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we have time at the end, we will do a few more language patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;     Workshop: Discovering the Superhero in You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Superheroes!  They save lives, promote justice, right wrongs, and protect the weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     However, beyond their obvious powers like great strength, flight and invulnerability there is something         &lt;br /&gt;     more that defines a superhero - their determination to make the world a better place through the use of &lt;br /&gt;     their special gifts. This means that any of us, through the exploration of our own special gifts, can &lt;br /&gt;     discover the ?superhero within.? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Through a series of exercises, you will choose the superpowers you?ve dreamed of having, and bring &lt;br /&gt;     them into your everyday life. You will gain clarity on your life goals, find the internal motivation needed to &lt;br /&gt;     achieve those goals, and have a deeper appreciation for the gifts you bring to the world.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;Andover-Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
