Cost of dinner will be handled as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinks will be consigned to a separate check from the meal.

A sign for Second Story Theater is on Route 114, although it's somewhat hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be just inside the theater's main entrance at 7:30 and will be holding a small MEET-UP sign.
