<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;pre&gt;We are pleased to welcome Ben Einstein, who heads Brainstream, a local &lt;br /&gt;firm which designs, engineers and creates innovative products. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Ben has worked on many aspects of product development from concept &lt;br /&gt;initiation and refinement to prototyping and small-scale production to &lt;br /&gt;full-scale manufacturing. At Brainstream, Ben focuses on projects that &lt;br /&gt;fuse technology &amp;amp; user interaction and is responsible for daily &lt;br /&gt;operations. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;His work has been discussed in numerous publications including CNBC, &lt;br /&gt;The Robb Report, Maxim, CNET, Stuff.tv, This Old House, The Telegraph, &lt;br /&gt;Gizmodo, Cult Of Mac, Car &amp;amp; Driver Magazine, Playboy Magazine and on &lt;br /&gt;NPR. His extensive work in assembly and CNC machining optimizes design &lt;br /&gt;for production-oriented product development. He holds a Bachelors &lt;br /&gt;degree from Hampshire College focusing on Product Design and &lt;br /&gt;Development. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Ben's newest dream is the development of an old factory building in &lt;br /&gt;Holyoke into a center for innovation, including a idea which is called &lt;br /&gt;Maker College, where millions of dollars in tools would be available &lt;br /&gt;to members at a very LOW cost! Maker College also includes a startup &lt;br /&gt;program, which would be availble to help ALL of us develop ideas into &lt;br /&gt;programs and bring them to market - at low cost and high speed! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;This is one meeting that you will not want to miss! Bring your friends &lt;br /&gt;and contacts - new for 2011 - no cost for non-members (the public) to &lt;br /&gt;attend! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Web Site: www.brainstreamdesign.com &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note: Public meetings are now absolutely free (we used to ask for a $5 contribution).  &lt;br /&gt;So bring everyone you can think of!&lt;/pre&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Kat.</member_name><member_id>8999115</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen Blanchard</member_name><member_id>9728219</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1302184003000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Innovators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>innovation-49</urlname><id>987180</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5400009155</group_lon><name>Innovators' Resource Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1300233570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Public Meeting with Ben Einstein</name><id>16936020</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1302129000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/innovation-49/events/16936020/</event_url></item>
