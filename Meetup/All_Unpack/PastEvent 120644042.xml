Feel free to come, bring a snack and if you have any fun board games, bring them as well. I also have ping pong! email me if any questions! Not sure what the turn out will be, but we'll have fun no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let your GPS take you to my mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see the mailbox on moon road, turn on to the street right there, and it's the first house on the right... big cedar home...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, we may have an outdoor fire pit going too!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marion buteau</member_name><member_id>12445225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369361416000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1369226737000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play games at Marion's in Ashford</name><id>120644042</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369350000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/120644042/</event_url></item>
