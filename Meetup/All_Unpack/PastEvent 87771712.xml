&lt;p&gt;The Tap Brewpub is your number one destination in Haverhill for great, made from scratch food and great, made from scratch beer. A longstanding staple of downtown Haverhill, the Tap serves as a melting pot of great personality, service, and company with a craft brewery's taste in beer and a five star chef's taste in food. Not only do we provide a fantastic meal and drink, but we also spotlight local bands in our Limelight Lounge, and offer pool and beerball in our Playpen bar. Three floors of fun for all, The Tap is a welcome, fun experience, so if you haven't been before, it's worth it to come down and give us a look. If you have been, we appreciate your patronage, and look forward to seeing you again soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
