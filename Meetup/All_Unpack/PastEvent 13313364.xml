<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Just joined a team of runners being formed in our area to enjoy the fun of a 195 mile run starting in Branford and ending in Gillette Stadium in Foxborough Mass.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little reluctant about joining the team as an outsider but after meeting the group tonight it appeared several were meeting for the first time.  Currently there are 10 people committed, 7 men, 3 women and we are short two runners.  Anyone interested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is a two day relay race starting Friday morning in CT and finishing in MA by 7pm Saturday night.  Then there is an after party so the trip would most likely involve an overnight stay.  The 12 runners pile into 2 vans running day and night until the finish line.   Each person runs 3 legs of the race ranging from approximately 4-7 miles.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info can be found here...  &lt;a href="http://www.ragnarrelay.com/boston/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ragnarrela...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like great fun...  Estimated cost is $115 each plus incidentals.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to find two more runners before May 1st so let me know ASAP if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email:  Dan@CummingsTeam.com or you can call my cell 203-676-5947 begin_of_the_skype_highlighting              203-676-5947      end_of_the_skype_highlighting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Cummings</member_name><member_id>4930656</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274632064000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenRunners</urlname><id>426798</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272418711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven - Boston Ragnar Relay</name><id>13313364</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274439600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenRunners/events/13313364/</event_url></item>
