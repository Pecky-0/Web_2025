And now that we're in the good season for films there seems to never be enough time for them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About The Young Victoria:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of her 18th birthday and ascension to the English throne, young Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt, The Devil Wears Prada) is caught in a royal power struggle. Her first years of rule are turbulent, and the court is filled with intrigue, but it is her blossoming love affair with Prince Albert (Rupert Friend, Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice), the suitor who wins her heart, that will determine the strength of her reign. Can she dedicate her life to her country and her heart to the one man she truly loves? Paul Bettany, Miranda Richardson, Jim Broadbent , Thomas Kretschmann and Mark Strong co-star in this passionate and romantic look at one of history's greatest loves stories. Written by Julian Fellowes (Academy Award winning screenwriter of Gosford Park) and directed by Jean-Marc Vall√©e (C.R.A.Z.Y.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262749910000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Young Victoria</name><id>12236436</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263071700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12236436/</event_url></item>
