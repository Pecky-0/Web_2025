Nerds represent!&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to get there early and try and reserve a couple of rows in the name of meetup.  I will put out red meetup signs at the end of each row.  Feel free to come up and sit with us and introduce yourself. I have brown hair, about 5'5' and will be sporting a black messenger bag.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending an &amp;quot;adopt a nerd&amp;quot; approach.  If you see someone hovering nearby the meetup zone, introduce yourself, &amp;quot;Hi, I am (insert name here); are you with meetup?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward there are options to go on lab tours, and sometimes folks will grab a bite to eat at Bertucci's. If you are interested in food let me know and we can look for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you not familiar with SITN's lecture format, lectures are free, accessible, and open to the public. All lectures are given entirely by graduate students at Harvard and focus on hot topics in science research and news.&lt;br /&gt;All lectures are on Wednesdays from 7-9 PM at the Armenise Amphitheater at Harvard Medical School&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;https://sitn.hms.harv...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to the lecture hall are here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/directions/" target="_blank"&gt;https://sitn.hms.harv...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachel</member_name><member_id>8085411</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288310613000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>78</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283526981000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forget-Me-Not: How Memories Are Formed and Lost</name><id>14645459</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288220400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14645459/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/b/global_2222155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
