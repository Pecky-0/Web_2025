This meeting on March 2 at 7 pm is for Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert and will be downstairs at Life Alive.  While meeting in January, we decided it would be fun to look for book that combined humor and TED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/dan_gilbert.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ted.com/sp...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Stumbling on Happiness is an absolutely fantastic book that will shatter your most deeply held convictions about how your own mind works. Ceaselessly entertaining, Gilbert is the perfect guide to some of the most interesting psychological research ever performed. Think you know what makes you happy? You won't know for sure until you have read this book.&amp;quot; â€”Steven D.
