This is a great place to meet new and current members in a low key setting, before heading out to one of the near-by clubs in the area.  This is a great event to meet new people and to get your groove on!  New and current members welcome, and feel free to bring a friend or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has the weather gotten you down? Don't let winter get in the way of having a great time this Friday night!  We will most likely go to the Liquor Store, located near Sweetwater.  The Liquor Store is well known for its mechanical bull riding, and you know you want to go for a ride!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8:30pm in the main bar area at Sweetwater, finding the group should not be difficult.  We will head over to the Liquor Store around 10pm to beat the lines.  Please meet us at Sweetwater, and get there early as to have time to meet folks and beat the lines later.  Cover:  None for Sweetwater, but there will be a cover for Liquor Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site.
