(Info on the Park and Ride location is at &lt;a href="http://www.nh.gov/dot/nhrideshare/p18.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nh.gov/dot...&lt;/a&gt;)  For those of you who already have full cars and have made their arrangements, you don't need to meet up with us.   PLEASE RSVP!!! I don't want to leave anyone behind because I didn't know you were coming.  Please check the website below if you are driving to print out directions, but I will try to bring a couple of copies with me.  I will have a couple of spaces in my car and I believe Paula will as well.  If you have questions, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For directions and more information, their website is &lt;br /&gt;www.yarn.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email Denise if you have questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>1774915</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168869651000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Knitters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>knitting-486</urlname><id>179362</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Concord Knitting Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163367336000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WEBS Field Trip</name><id>5262438</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168696800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/knitting-486/events/5262438/</event_url></item>
