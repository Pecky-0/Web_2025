RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT! &lt;br /&gt;

Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go hiking, snow shoeing, or cross country skiing on the trails at Audubon Society Massabesic Trails. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. So come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends. Rentals are available at the office, if you do not own your own snowshoes. Call the center to inquire about the rental rates. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will meet at 2:00 pm in the parking lot off of the Audubon Center. &lt;br /&gt;

Notes on Difficulty Rating &lt;br /&gt;

The trails are generally flat. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails. &lt;br /&gt;

If anyone cares to, we can then go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a hot chocolate, at a nearby restaurant. I hope to see you there. &lt;br /&gt;
