I'll try and pick a light movie for the first night.  Then we can talk about the next night's theme.  This is assuming that this is a hit and there will be a next night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know your thoughts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to take away the maybe option to leave it open for only those who KNOW they can come!  Please don't RSVP yes if you are a maybe!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I live here</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248395759000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245980707000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bollywood Potluck</name><id>10738433</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248044400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/10738433/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/8/global_9344168.jpeg</photo_url></item>
