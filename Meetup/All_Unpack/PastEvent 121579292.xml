&lt;p&gt;Let's meet at the bottom of section 37. We'll line up and run/cheer each other to the top for a few sections, and then break up into different paces after a while. First timers should plan to spend about 20-30 minutes doing 5-15 sections; full tour takes an hour or so (yes there are crazy people that can do it all in 20 minutes but you won't see me trying to break my face that way :-) It's always a good time!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alexandra Sieving</member_name><member_id>50951822</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369917256000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Waltham-Trail-Runners</urlname><id>1479223</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Waltham Trail Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1369743213000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Run the seats at Harvard Stadium</name><id>121579292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369870200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Waltham-Trail-Runners/events/121579292/</event_url></item>
