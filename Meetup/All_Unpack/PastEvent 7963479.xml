It is the early 1960s and both Matti and Pajala are about to enter adolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the American Library Association Notable Book's top picks of 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that &lt;b&gt;we are meeting on Sunday, June 22nd&lt;/b&gt; which is the 4th Sunday. We wanted to avoid any potential conflicts with Father's Day, which falls on June 15th, the third Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to this book on amazon.com: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Popular-Music-Vittula-Mikael-Niemi/dp/1583226591/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1211152172&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fred Hapgood</member_name><member_id>2525411</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214338249000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>International Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-427</urlname><id>216983</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Reading books by international writers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211145075000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reading books by international writers June Meeting</name><id>7963479</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214164800000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-427/events/7963479/</event_url></item>
