Dr. Ang will be presenting a seminar and discussion about Healing and the Brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healing and the Brain I&lt;br /&gt;Topics will include the relevance of the brain to healers, healing, and society, the cerebral cortex, the brainstem, the cerebellum, and the autonomic nervous system.  By the end of the seminars, participants will come away with a deeper appreciation of the brain and its relevance to their practice and daily life.  Also, they will have a key to further explore the intricacies of the brain on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Energy Healing group meets Tuesday evenings to meditate and share energy healings. Meetings are Tuesday evenings and start at 7:30 pm with a guided Meditation on Twin Hearts followed by a discussion lead by Gene Ang, PhD. During the discussion participants reflect on their individual meditation experience as well as their experiences in meditation and energy healing in their lives. After the meditation, Dr. Ang and participants meet to give each other energy healings. This is a fun and relaxing way to spend a Tuesday evening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit the website for more details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meditation website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fvpt.com/Meditation.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fvpt.com/M...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farmington Valley Physical Therapy website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fvpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fvpt.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Periodic workshops are also held including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superbrain Yoga&lt;br /&gt;Healing and the Brain&lt;br /&gt;Pranic Healing&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541130000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173666276000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Healing and the Brain Special Meeting</name><id>5560607</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176852600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/5560607/</event_url></item>
