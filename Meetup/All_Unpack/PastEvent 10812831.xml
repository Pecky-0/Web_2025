Perhaps carpooling can be arranged through the mailing list...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Atheism Examiner Jackie Lavache has a post on Radcliffe's newly public apostasy, at &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8776-Boston-Atheism-Examiner~y2009m7d6-Actor-Daniel-Radcliffe-is-an-out-atheist" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.examiner.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248306654000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246896004000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Midnight Screening of Irrational Harry Potter Movie</name><id>10812831</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247630400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/10812831/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
