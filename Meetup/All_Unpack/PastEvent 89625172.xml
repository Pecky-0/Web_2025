 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini.  In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails.  As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile.  But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater.  Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion.  His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Seabiscuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.  Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Anne</member_name><member_id>13265674</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>RobC13</member_name><member_id>13707536</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355510317000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351861695000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Discuss "Unbroken"  by Laura Hillenbrand</name><id>89625172</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355356800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/89625172/</event_url></item>
