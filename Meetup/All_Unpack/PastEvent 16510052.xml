Drawing on elements of agile design, sociocracy, and Integral theory, Holacracy allows organizations to transcend the limits of ego and develop into effective, creative, and nimble organisms more powerful than the sum of their parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk, offered by TelosityOS, will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give you insight into the fundamental principles of Holacracy;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer tools and processes that can align any organization with its purpose and uplevel the way it goes about doing the work; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how this evolutionary &amp;ldquo;operating system&amp;rdquo; can effectively maximize any organization&amp;rsquo;s creativity and effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
