As a result, the bar area was crowded and a bit loud, so we migrated to O'Briens for drinks outside and later played some pool and sang some karaoke.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, let's do it again!&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet on the Deck at 7:00, and from there we can listen to the music, watch the sunset, and/or move on from there!&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it's a good way to get some ya-ya's out before it's back to work on Monday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to call me at 631-433-5223 with questions or comments/suggestions! Keep this number handy 'cause if you're late we may have moved on, and we wouldn't want to leave you behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our pledge: Mark and Mia will NEVER cancel an event (I have and will again drink alone!) - so if you decide to join us at the last minute - we will be there - count on it!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the bar - or call Mark at 631-433-5223</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>10739343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281534980000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280295441000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Sunsets</name><id>dxvcpynlblb</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281308400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/14238188/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/8/global_1041544.jpeg</photo_url></item>
