I can update the information as we get closer to the night of the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reminded that there are more artists than just Stretch Playing tonight, unfortunately I don't know too much about them or what they will be playing tonight. (Thx Susan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artist starting times posted on Sally Obrien's website were....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:00p  Alastair Moock with Mike Dinallo&lt;br /&gt;9:00p  Planetarium, Stretch, Katie-Rose &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/michaeldinallo" target="_blank"&gt;Mike Dinallo MYspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/stretchinboston" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to STRETCH!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stretch is typically a 5 piece Jazz band playing a unique Jazz, Fusion and even Reggae mix. &lt;br /&gt;Dave Hess is playing woodwinds, Paul Erlick and Mike Herman's on Guitars. &lt;br /&gt;George Chinaglia plays Bass and their Drummer Randy Wooten.&lt;br /&gt;Stretch does not play very often so catch them when you can, you won't regret it.&lt;br /&gt;Many people who have seen them insist they are better to hear and see Live than recorded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to Meetup with some of you there. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of time to sign up and schedule to see this group.&lt;br /&gt;E-mail me if you have any questions...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Sally Obrien's is a relatively small place.
