Jessica is one who understands this today.  She will share some of her knowledge with us as well as bring along some teas for us to sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This potluck will be followed by a four part class on herbology for those who are interested.  Even if you cannot attend the meetup/potluck, you can take part in these classes.  Times and prices will be determined soon and posted here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring enough food to feed at least four people and be ready for great food, great conversation and a terrific time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263855956000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261267521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learning about the Healing Qualities of Plants</name><id>kzlnyncbvb</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263682800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/12117649/</event_url></item>
