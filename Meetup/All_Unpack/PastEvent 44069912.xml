Free outdoor show at the Kendall Square Community Skating Rink, near Kendall Red Line T stop. The show is about a half-hour performance by accomplished local competitors and coaches. They usually serve free hot cider or cocoa and there is a cash snack bar. The show is free, dress warmly to stand outside. Afterward, you can rent ice skates to try your self, or bring your own to skate. (maybe $5-8) Some of the performers stay so you might get some advice! My sister is the director and also performs, she is amazing by the way! :) This is not a conversation Meetup, just a fun social event to welcome Winter! Hope to see you there! &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/132329973543325/" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.facebook....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324234626000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323576259000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Off-topic: Kendall Rink Opening Show (free, outdoors)</name><id>44069912</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324148400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/44069912/</event_url></item>
