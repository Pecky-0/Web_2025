<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I've got the week off from Friday, Feb. 24 (evening) into March. I was thinking of going to a warmer climate- right now I've got my eye on the Gulf Coast but I'm open to suggestions. I enjoy cultural venues, historic sites, shopping and 70-80 degrees, near the water would be a nice option. If you have the same time off and would like to try a four to five day stint, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330133275000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325632305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February Break </name><id>46522462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330128000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/46522462/</event_url></item>
