Have you read books such as The Four Agreements &amp;amp; The Fifth Agreement by don Miguel Ruiz or The New Earth by Eckhart Tolle? Join with like minded/hearted individuals with the desire to live from the heart &amp;amp; awareness on a path of transformation. The evening includes a theme relevant to our everyday lives that we will explore together with awareness &amp;amp; a time for meditation. Experience yourself beyond your normal perception through shifting your point of view &amp;amp; connect with your heart's desire. Support the healing of yourself, community &amp;amp; the world in the space of love, wisdom and service as drawn from ancient mystery schools.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Grace Ventura</member_name><member_id>10412901</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331684308000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Transformers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Wisdom-Grace-Northshore</urlname><id>1523640</id><group_lat>42.5699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Closing Down Group.
