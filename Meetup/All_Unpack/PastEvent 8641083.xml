Now it seems like an allegory about race relations, doomsday environmentalism, totalitarianism, even the Bush regime’s denial of good science. Its screenwriters were Rod Serling, host of The Twilight Zone and a noted writer of science fiction stories and of television screenplays, paired with the formerly black-listed Michael Wilson. Together they wrote some of the best dialogue ever in s science fiction film. Jerry Goldsmith, usually a stalwart studio composer, took a lot of chances with a futuristic often atonal score.  Heston is the chest beater and the chimps are the quiet  and thoughtful ones, most notably played by Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new 35mm print is from Criterion Pictures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(US, 1968)  112 min.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby no later than 9:15.
