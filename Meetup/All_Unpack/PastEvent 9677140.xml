If you would like to also go the movie, please refer to the Push for president day meet-up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check back the day before for the exact time of our renovation, as we won't know the time until the movie play schedule is out.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you see you all there!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just inside the door, look for the rainbow hair comb.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235345105000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233804096000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>President's Day Lunch</name><id>9677140</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234811700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/9677140/</event_url></item>
