We have a new exchange student, and while Luisa's not quite as game-crazy as Seung Chan (who could be?), she has played Bohnanza, Thurn &amp;amp; Taxis, Keltis, and many other German games. She is German, so perhaps this shouldn't be a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, you're welcome to join us for some or all of the time. I hope to play Steam this session, along with whatever other new games I can push to the table, but as always I'll play whatever needs to be played so that folks have fun. Please suggest titles that you'd like to play, and I'll do my best to read rules in advance and be ready to teach. Ask for directions if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the host of the house</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253982502000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251828461000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>11259209</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252166400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/11259209/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
