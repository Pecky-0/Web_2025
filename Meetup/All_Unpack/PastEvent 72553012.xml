Join our very special guest speaker, Margaret Barron from London, UK. Margaret has a BA in Adult Education &amp;amp; Training and works as a Personal Development Trainer in London, UK creating and facilitating seminars in all aspects of self development. She is passionate about people recognizing their inner potential and bringing this into their lives. She has been studying meditation for over 20 years with the Brahma Kumaris and has delivered talks and workshops around the UK as well as when traveling to other parts of the world. She is inspired by the practical application of spiritual understanding with a particular interest in how creativity and imagery works as an interface between spirituality and everyday life. &lt;br /&gt;

 Margarette states: &lt;br /&gt;

"One of the foundations of a happy and successful life is the &lt;br /&gt;

attitude I adopt to the people, situation and circumstances that come my way. My choice as to whether I see the glass as half empty or half full sets in motion a series of thoughts, beliefs and actions that determine the quality of my life. You are welcome to join us for this very interesting conversation on attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
