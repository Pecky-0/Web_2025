<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>After last week's great turnout, let's do another one on Thursday. Sorry for the short notice but I  have been busily putting together a software release over the last days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here's the usual note about the &lt;b&gt;meeting place&lt;/b&gt;: In the past there had been some confusion about the meeting point. Please note that we'll meet in the parking lot on Depot Road. If you check the location on Google Maps, there is no actual Depot Rd 220 but it should pretty accurately show you the location of the parking lot. Also, please write down my cell phone # 848-448-6663 to let me and the other riders know in case you get lost or stuck in traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the trail,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christoph&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220132078000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mountain Bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mountainbikes-102</urlname><id>485750</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>New England MTB Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219866107000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Massabesic again</name><id>8633716</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219959000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mountainbikes-102/events/8633716/</event_url></item>
