The season ended early. Sorry!!! So, we are changing the details of the event. We will meet around 6pm and enjoy the Hallolantern Hay Ride. We can head out to dinner after that at Barrett's Ale House in Bridgewater. Their website is &lt;a href="http://www.barrettsalehouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.barrettsal...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still pumpkin picking available but that means two hayrides during the day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people are still interested in the pumpkin picking we can post a discussion thread and sort out the details. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The farm closes at 4pm and reopens for Hallolantern hayrides at dark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hayrides cost $14 for adults. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please update your RSVP if your plans have changed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** This will be a joint event with SE 20's and 30's couples ****&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dawn/Parker</member_name><member_id>6484240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287942100000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285421137000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hallolantern Hayride</name><id>14890737</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287871200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/14890737/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/c/global_11514924.jpeg</photo_url></item>
