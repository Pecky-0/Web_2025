The Green Gorilla's will teach you how to build one, we will then transport it to a house and mount it on the roof and connected to the oil water heater and test it out.   Come and learn how to build your own solar hot water heater for under $100 to build. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solar hot water heater will produce about 20 gallons of water at 120 degrees in half an hour and 140 degrees in one hour.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm estimating the whole process will take about three hours to build.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cost for this event. The Green Guerillia Institute will be providing all the materials for this event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be joined by other meetup groups, so prepare to meet others who share a passion for saving money and being more sustainable!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will go for might go for dinner. If anyone has any questions don't hesitate to contact me at: 603-509-2907 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254586403000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Green Earthlings</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-286</urlname><id>459660</id><group_lat>43.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast  Energy and Permaculture Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245521369000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Solar Hot  Water Workshop:  Build your own solar hot water heater.</name><id>10695902</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246219200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-286/events/10695902/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/4/global_8847428.jpeg</photo_url></item>
