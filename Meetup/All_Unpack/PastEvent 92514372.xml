<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Meet in the parking lot of the Stone Zoo at 11:30. &lt;a href="http://fells.org/fells.html" class="linkified"&gt;http://fells.org/fells.html&lt;/a&gt; The Fells is a 2,060 acre natural treasure, something all too rare in this urban/suburban landscape. A diverse landscape of rocky hills, meadows, wetlands, oak and hickory forests, quiet ponds, vernal pools, panoramic vistas and intriguing geological features distinguish this woodland. This range of habitat sustains a variety of wildlife including mammals such as coyote, fisher, red fox, and white tail deer. Reptiles and amphibians are also resident. Birds such as scarlet tanager, eastern bluebird, hawks and many neo-tropical migrants nest, find cover and food here. A wide variety of common and rare trees, shrubs, wildflowers and insects too numerous to mention make their home in the Fells and add to the biological diversity. &lt;span style="text-decoration : line-through"&gt;Afterwards we will have lunch at: J J Grimsby &amp;amp; Co (781) 665-1123 1 Lynn Fells Pkwy Melrose, MA 02176&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>time changed to 11:30</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353699097000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353681412000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Middlesex Fells east - today</name><id>92514372</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353688200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/92514372/</event_url></item>
