Think of it as the San Lorenzo Market in Florence, a crafts fair and Girl’s Night Out all rolled into one at the&amp;quot; ID Market (independent designers)&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly has secured a venue in the South end on Tremont Street, beginning in September, not far from the cyclorama building.  You rent space to sell your wares on the weekend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you design or sell apparel, jewelery or  accessories, or if you are a photographer or  fine artists  then you should come to this networking event to learn more about the ID market and to network with others interested in a place to sell.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Ranere</member_name><member_id>975035</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277489437000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275938039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Networking meetup with Kimberly Benson</name><id>13727057</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277416800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/13727057/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/f/global_9836927.jpeg</photo_url></item>
