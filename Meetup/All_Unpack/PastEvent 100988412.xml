&lt;p&gt;The Patriots are out, the NHL Lockout is over and the Bruins season is underway so please join the Natives along with Wakefield Week Nights to watch the Bruins vs the New York Islanders Game on Friday night at Harrington's. What better way to spend a cold night out in the suburbs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors and one of the best St Patricks Day Parties in the suburbs. We have been there before. The food is great and the full menu will be available for purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive early by 6:30 PM and get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing. Stop by for drinks, stay for dinner and stick around to watch the Bruins game.  Or arrive  later and stay until when ever. There is live music entertainment after 9:00pm so the place will be busy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Time is 7:05 PM for the Bruins vs the New York Islanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives have been organizing Game Viewing Events over the last 2 years with up to 85 people attending at various Boston, Woburn and Wakefield locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's in front of Bank of America and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center. And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station via the Reading and Haverhill Trains stopping at Wakefield Station with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion Street, right on to Main Street and 1 block to Water Street. If you are joining us from the City this is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER AND TIP YOUR SERVERS! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP if you think you can attend. Invite, guests, friends, and co-workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there.&lt;/p&gt;
