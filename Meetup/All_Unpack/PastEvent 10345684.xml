Learn the history of the neighborhoods that once occupied this space and about the present day urban planning that is knitting Boston back together. &lt;br /&gt;Explore the Greenway parks, development parcels, and learn about changes occurring along the Greenway's edge. As the centerpiece of the Big Dig's urban restoration this tour will discuss how the Greenway is changing the way residents and visitors experience and interact with the City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tour travels the full one mile of the Greenway - exploring the Bulfinch Triangle section, the North End parks, the Wharf parks, the Dewey Square parcels and ending at the Chinatown parks.  The route is flat but it's a two hour tour (so please bring along comfy shoes and some water). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is being co-sponsored with the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Conservancy, visit them at www.rosekennedygreenway.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tour costs $15 ($5 for card-carrying &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot members&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for people with Boston By Foot badges, bags, hats, tshirts, etc.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gretchen G</member_name><member_id>7594534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247264154000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241555928000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greenway and Beyond Walking Tour</name><id>10345684</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246802400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/10345684/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/1/2/global_8512370.jpeg</photo_url></item>
