I have scheduled this special supplementary bookcrossing event for this Saturday for those folks who drive cars and live in the suburbs and might not be able to make it into the city by 7:00 on a weeknight for our regularly-scheduled events.  This location is also accessible to non-driving people via the 350 bus from Alewife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be reaching out to active bookcrossers in the area via bookcrossing PMs, and I'll post it in the forum too.  This is short notice, but I wanted to schedule this soon, so that those who are interested can meet each other before the Shakespeare event in the works for July 28 - info to follow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least one other person and I will be there for sure, so come chat with us about books and bookcrossing.  Friendly people, free wi-fi, excellent pastry and coffee.... a fine way to spend your Saturday afternoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liz</member_name><member_id>220016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184786343000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184175280000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Saturday Bookcrossing Meetup!</name><id>6007995</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184436000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/6007995/</event_url></item>
