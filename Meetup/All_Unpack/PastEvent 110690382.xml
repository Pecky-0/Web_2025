 &lt;br /&gt;

 Time to get back out on those fabulous trails at Beaver Brook in Hollis NH. This area is just full of beautiful views, ponds,... &lt;a href="http://www.beaverbrook.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/education-corridor.pdf" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.beaverbrook.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/education-corridor.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Let's meet at 2:00 PM at the "Dam Road" &amp;amp; "Wildlife Pond" trails parking lot entrance, located on Route 130 (about 1 ½ or 2 miles after crossing Route 122) &lt;br /&gt;

 and Hike for about 2-3 hours, with breaks/stops along the trails. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please know that my intent is to enjoy a casual afternoon in the woods, get a workout, enjoy everyone's company, but most important HAVE FUN! &lt;br /&gt;

 RECOMMENDATIONS: Wear waterproof or rugged shoes/boots the trails can be wet/muddy this time of year; Dress in layers bring plenty of water/fluids to keep hydrated and lunch/snack to fuel the body. &lt;br /&gt;

 DIRECTIONS: Route 3 to exit 6 Route 130 West towards Brookline, stay on Route 130 (approximately 8 ½ miles) and cross Route 122 (Main St), travel about 1 1/2 or 2 miles to trail parking lot on Right. &lt;br /&gt;
