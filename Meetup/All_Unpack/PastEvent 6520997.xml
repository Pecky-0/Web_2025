<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We had a very successful help2learn chinese meetup, 7 people showed up. Two first-timers, Rob who's starting to learn chinese but can speak&lt;br /&gt;German fluently, Cindy who's a native speaker from Shanghai, dropped in. Welcome to you both ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone enjoyed each other, even one of us couldn't speak any Chinese at all.  The rule was anything spoken in Chinese need to be repeated in English, so no one was left out ! Of course, once we get the conversation going, everything else will fall in place eventually ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you next meetup !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Edwin &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Edwin E Ouyang</member_name><member_id>4127989</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542348000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mandarin Chinese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>help2learnchinese</urlname><id>490150</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Help2LearnChinese Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191974646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Help2LearnChinese November Meetup</name><id>6520997</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193180400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/help2learnchinese/events/6520997/</event_url></item>
