While the short days makes it tough this time of year, we can always enjoy exploring different sections of the trail.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sunday I would like to explore the center and eastern sections of the main skyline trail. We can start at Houghton's Pond and travel east for about an hour and a half. We would then return on less traveled side trails and cross paths.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm thinking about a 3 hour hike, starting at 10am, with the option to add an hour if the group desires.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear layers and be prepared for cold wind. Please bring enough water and snacks for you and you pet. If you have to leave early I can always point you in the right direction but it would be wise bring a map.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a walk on paved paths. I like the ups and downs, and try to venture on more challenging terrain. Please wear sturdy footwear, as the leaves over rocks makes things slippery.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions please feel free to send me a message.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260285191000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259697359000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue Hills Skyline Traverse</name><id>11992319</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260111600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/11992319/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_12055972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
