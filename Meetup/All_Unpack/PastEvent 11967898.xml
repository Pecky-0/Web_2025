Is it ok for me to say it's enchanting? I don't know what other word describes it better. I hope you can join us for the tree lighting ceremony at 6:15 PM to be followed by a drink at one of Guilford's local watering holes. This will be a memorable evening. I'm guessing that parking will be a bit of an issue, so try to arrive early. Let's rendevous at 6:00 PM, at the southwest entrance to the Green, right across from the chocolate shop. Call me if you have trouble finding us or are running late and we have moved from the rendevous point.&lt;br /&gt;802&lt;br /&gt;233&lt;br /&gt;9060&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260141283000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259427781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Guilford Tree Lighting</name><id>11967898</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259967600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/11967898/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
