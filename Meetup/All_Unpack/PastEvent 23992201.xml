Many local churches and religious groups take part, and it would send a strong message if our secular community came out in strength to support our values. We will be meeting at 8:30am in front of the 99 Restaurant on Summer Street. We will have our banner &amp;amp; t-shirts (which is optional - if you would rather not wear one, we ask you wear a bright blue shirt/t-shirt) Hope to see you there! Please sign up soon - the earlier the better!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris Lackey</member_name><member_id>7618967</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309871756000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309374060000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Humanist Excursion - Represent GWH in the Fitchburg 4th of July Parade!</name><id>23992201</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309782600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/23992201/</event_url></item>
