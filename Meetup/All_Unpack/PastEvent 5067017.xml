We'll use the time to get to know each other, talk about current issues in the 9/11 Truth movement, and plan local actions in public education about this critical issue, including a public speakout starting at noon at  the Federal Building in Springfield on the anniversary, 9/11/06, continuing until about 6 pm, to catch people as they leave work.  We'll also plan the evening event for September 11th, which will happen at First Churches in Northampton, beginning at 7pm. The event will include one or more film clips about 9/11, plus speakers and Q &amp;amp; A. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meetings are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Tuesdays -- 6:30 to 9:30pm&lt;br /&gt;August 22 - Bangs Community Center, Amherst&lt;br /&gt;August 29 - Media Education Foundation, Noho&lt;br /&gt;Sept... 05 - Media Education Foundation, Noho&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Info about these 9/11 Truth meetings plus other important info can be found at www.flybynews.com.
