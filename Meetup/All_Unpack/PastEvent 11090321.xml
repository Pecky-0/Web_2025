We decided to do a little promotion for all cheese heads if they fancy watching the game together. Where going to be having $2 draft special as well as free food on the night. Don't forget its a private function room for all packers fans with 3 hd plasma tv's as well as a private bar and toilet. What more could fans ask for? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come along and support your team with fellow fans!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Oran</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Packers Boston &amp; Ray Butler</member_name><member_id>9971064</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253467672000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Greenbaypackersboston</urlname><id>1489502</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Green Bay Packers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250035966000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Green Bay Packers August Meetup</name><id>11090321</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252882800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Greenbaypackersboston/events/11090321/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/6/b/global_10281947.jpeg</photo_url></item>
