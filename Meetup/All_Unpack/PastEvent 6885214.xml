<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Bonjour tout le monde,&lt;br /&gt;We are having a holiday celebration for language speakers!There are about 25 people signed up so far (not all through Meetup site)  I am extending this invitation to groups that speak French, German and Spanish.  This will be a pre-New Year's party to practice and celebrate our languages, simultaneously!&lt;br /&gt;If you are part of another language organization (Alliance Francaise, par example) please let me know. I am happy to invite those outside of the Meetup site. I would like this to be a multi-language, multi-cultural celebration with food, live music, and everyone trying their best not to speak English!&lt;br /&gt;It will be in a private home in West Hartford not far from Panera Bread on Sunday Dec 30 4-7PM.&lt;br /&gt;Directions will be sent after you RSVP or call above phone number. (I didn't want to put address on the web).  Offerings for the table are welcome, but please keep them vegetarian (no meat or fish).  &lt;br /&gt;Merci,&lt;br /&gt;Dianne&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>3815102</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199221533000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><why>We will be having fun eating and communicating in languages other than English</why><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-West-Hartford-Groupe-de-French</urlname><id>459167</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6900024414</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Groupe de French</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197246357000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Languages party!FÃªte des langues!</name><id>6885214</id><headcount>43</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199048400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-West-Hartford-Groupe-de-French/events/6885214/</event_url></item>
