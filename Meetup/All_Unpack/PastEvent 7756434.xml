I will be in the paring lot at 1PM to meet any new climbers.  Call my cell if you don't see me (617 501-6217.)   Please bring water and any other basics.  Bring any climbing stuff that you might have like harness, shoes...  E mail if you need a ride. We will try to figure out a carpool system before Sunday.  For example, I can pick people up at 11:00 AM from Porter Square red line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving to Quincy Quarries. Take exit 8 on HW 93.  I suggest looking at a google map.  It's confusing from the South.  Just follow the signs.    &lt;br /&gt;Bring a smile...&lt;br /&gt;Geoff&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call my cell 617 501-6217. Ask for Geoff.
