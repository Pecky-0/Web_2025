There's a good selection of German beer on draft and food prepared by volunteers (usually a few kinds of sausage, sauerkraut, potato salad, and some specials), and both the beer and food is at really great prices. Let's meet up on August 12th! It's open until late so if you can't come right at 7, don't worry.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1313486629000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1310993515000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>German Club in Pawtucket</name><id>26123511</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313190000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/26123511/</event_url></item>
