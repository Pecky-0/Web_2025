Town Hall won't do per game, only per hour.  We didnt like that last time.    From there, we get on Rt 10, right on Rt 95 to head to the Marshall Tucker Concert after for those going on.  Rt 10 is assesable  from Rt 6E from Johnston, and 95 from North and South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set it up w/ Stephanie... 4.70 per game per person, free shoe rental, she set aside 6 lanes for us.  normally it is 4.65/game plus 4.50 shoe rental.  so we are saving nearly 5 bucks on that... if we need more lanes, I think we can get them.  bring friends, relatives, neighbors.. just no politicians!!    these are big balls.  Legion nearby is small balls but a fate worst than death&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick Clark</member_name><member_id>17851281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356871575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352866331000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Duckpin bowl again...</name><id>91317892</id><headcount>13</headcount><duration>12600000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356804000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/91317892/</event_url></item>
