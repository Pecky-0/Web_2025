Simply provide the stock symbol and a brief explanation of your basis for why it might be a good candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, bringing questions regarding a favorite stock from your own watchlists (or perhaps even a trade from the past) for a group critique is very much encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to a lively and engaging discussion, and hope all can attend (if you have friends that might like to attend, please bring them along).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a lively meeting!
