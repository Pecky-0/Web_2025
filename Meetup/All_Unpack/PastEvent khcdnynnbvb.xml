<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We have been looking at different practices within the Native community.  This month, Stone Holder of the Abenaki tribe will teach us the correct way to make and use a medicine bag as practiced in his tradition.  All supplies will be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Holder is a patient teacher and I know you will learn much from him about not only making the medicine bag, but also about the traditions associated with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bring enough food to feed at least four people and be ready to have a great time, good food and wonderful conversations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be worried about the number of RSVP's as a number of people also attend who are not a member of this meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we are on Facebook now.  Just search for A Place of Light and join us in our weekly exercises and sharing of experiences!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287326885000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285681225000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Making a Medicine Bag</name><id>khcdnynnbvb</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287266400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/14923507/</event_url></item>
