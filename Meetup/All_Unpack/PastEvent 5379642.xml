I'll bring my new Linux Certified laptop, which is running Kubuntu.  This is my first experience with a Debian based system, so hopefully part of our discussion can be in this area.  I'm guessing that many of you have experience in this area that could be useful to all of the attendees.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody with an interest in Linux is welcome to attend this Meetup - your ability level does not matter.  We've had attendees in the past who range from novice to guru, and everything in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider parking behind The Java Room near Center Sports.  Parking is admittedly rather bad at this location, but is very good next to Center Sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andy Stewart</member_name><member_id>3117855</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1169251585000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Linux Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>linux-393</urlname><id>304994</id><group_lat>42.6199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>The Chelmsford Linux Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168383305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Linux @ The Java Room</name><id>5379642</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1169078400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/linux-393/events/5379642/</event_url></item>
