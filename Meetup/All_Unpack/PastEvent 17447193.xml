&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sweet Trail runs from Longmarsh Road in Durham to the shore of Great Bay in Newmarket. The area is&amp;nbsp;very scenic and is&amp;nbsp;home to lots of beavers and beaver dams! Ponds full of wildlife are everywhere and I understand that the area feels surprisingly remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ad364c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't forget insect repellant, water, and hiking shoes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trailhead&lt;/strong&gt;: From Durham follow Rt 108 a couple of miles to a left on Longmarsh Rd. Follow Longmarsh to its end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time/Distance&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an easy and mostly flat but very scenic trail. If we&amp;nbsp;hike the entire circuit, it would be 8.6 miles out and back. We can decide at the beginning (or maybe at a turn around point) if we want to do the entire hike.&amp;nbsp;It should take up to 4 hours if we do the&amp;nbsp;full length. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://durham.nh.us/generalpdfs/Sweet_Trail.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sweet Trail Map &amp;amp; Brochure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Nature Conservancy, the Town of Durham, and the Great Bay Resource Protection Partnership helped plan and develop the trail which highlights diverse wildlife habitats through the 2500 acre Crommet Creek watershed. The trail crosses land owned by NH Fish and Game, Society for the Protection of NH Forests, Town of Durham and The Nature Conservancy. The goal of the trail was to create a longer and more remote hiking and wildlife viewing experience. It was constructed with the help of local volunteers, New York City youth, and AMC trail crews. There are several picturesque overlooks and bridges along the trail offering views of beaver ponds and a great blue heron rookery. It is not unusual to see American black ducks, osprey, beaver, turtles and many songbirds along the trail. From freshwater marshes to tidal creeks, you will see the interconnections between fresh and saltwater habitats and the abundance of life that depends on these ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be joined by Social Fun members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We'll meet in the parking lot at the Trailhead on Longmarsh Road.&amp;nbsp; See the Trail Map &amp;amp; Brochure link above for exact location.&amp;nbsp; I have a silver Subaru Forest.&amp;nbsp; If any problems finding us, call me at 978-390-2893.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hike will be cancelled for bad weather--could still do dinner at Riverworks in Newmarket, if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debbie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
