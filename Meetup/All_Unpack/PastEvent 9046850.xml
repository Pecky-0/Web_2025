As this film is in its first weekend, I recommend you buy your tickets ahead of time by visiting &lt;a href="https://tickets2.landmarktheatres.com/Ticketing/Default.aspx?TheatreID=231&amp;amp;MovieID=9167&amp;amp;ShowDate=11/15/2008&amp;amp;ScheduleID=52353" target="_blank"&gt;the Kendall's site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the most astonishing and inspiring survival tales of all time. On October 13, 1972, a young rugby team from Montevideo, Uruguay, boarded a plane for a match in Chile—and then vanished into thin air. Two days before Christmas, 16 of the 45 passengers miraculously resurfaced. They had managed to survive for 72 days after their plane crashed on a remote Andean glacier. Thirty-five years later, the survivors return to the crash site—known as the Valley of Tears—to recount their harrowing story of defiant endurance and indestructible friendship. Previously documented in the 1973 worldwide bestseller Alive (and the 1993 Ethan Hawke movie of the same name), this shocking true story finally gets the cinematic treatment it deserves. Visually breathtaking and crafted with riveting detail by documentary filmmaker (and childhood friend of the survivors) Gonzalo Arijón with a masterful combination of on-location interviews, archival footage and re-enactments, Stranded is by turns hauntingly powerful and spiritually moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A New York Times Critics’ pick, Stephen Holden says: “[The survivors’] memories, akin to those of returning astronauts who studied Earth from outer space, are worth hearing. Mortal terror is outweighed by an overwhelming sense of wonder and personal discovery, as a ferocious will to live, not only for themselves but for one another, propels them to perform superhuman feats while exhausted and near starvation.”  Read the complete NY Times review &lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/movies/22stra.html?ref=movies" target="_blank"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is our custom, Nina will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row after the film and then it’s off to a local restaurant to discuss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be holding a Meetup sign near the front row after the film!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nina</member_name><member_id>4237709</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225205494000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>STRANDED: I’ve Come From a Plane That Crashed on the Mountains</name><id>9046850</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226774700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9046850/</event_url></item>
