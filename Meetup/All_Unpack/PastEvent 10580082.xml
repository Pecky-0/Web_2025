<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hey guys,&lt;br /&gt;Going to change up meetups moving forward and likely only have one official meetup a week, switching up locations and which day of the week.&lt;br /&gt;For this week, we will be having a Meetup in New Haven on Saturday night.&lt;br /&gt;Meeting at Nikkita at 10:30 and bar hopping throughout the night around New Haven.&lt;br /&gt;This isn't a &amp;quot;rookie&amp;quot; night, as we have had a lot of those lately. &lt;br /&gt;If you come out, you will have wingmen with you, not instructors. Note the difference. You will be expected to push yourself into sets and if one of your wingmen sees you needing help, they will assist. &lt;br /&gt;The only way for everyone to grow is to be able to step up and take the initiative on their own to take their own game to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;Wall flowers are not an option for this night.&lt;br /&gt;Like Sergey says, &amp;quot;You can keep doing what you have been and die alone, or you can step up and change it and get the women you deserve.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call me</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319645515000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244164437000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Night Out in New Haven</name><id>10580082</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244341800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10580082/</event_url></item>
