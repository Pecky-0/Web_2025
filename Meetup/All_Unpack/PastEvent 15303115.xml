As I've written previously, ut encapsulates the 4th Ed. D&amp;amp;D experience into a self-contained board game that recreates (quite well if I do say so myself) the gothic horror experience of the original Castle Ravenloft adventure.  There are a number of scenarios that can be played in the game, whether it's a daylight assault to steal Strahd's treasures or an epic battle against Strahd himself to once and for all end his evil reign over the land of Barovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also offer Three Dragon Ante, or D&amp;amp;D Poker if you will, as an option.  I'll have both the base game and the emperor's gambit expansion with me, with player attendance and desire determining what gets run.  We have two copies of Castle Ravenloft, so we can run two tables of that, or some mix of Ravenloft and Three Dragon Ante.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you guys there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanios&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290135253000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288653069000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Castle Ravenloft: The Board Game &amp; Three Dragon Ante</name><id>15303115</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290036600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/15303115/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
