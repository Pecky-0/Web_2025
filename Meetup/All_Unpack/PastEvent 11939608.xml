I figure at least some of us will want something to eat on Friday other than Turkey Sandwiches and leftover cranberry sauce, so here's an option. Join us for Happy hour at Christopher Martins, &lt;a href="http://www.christophermartins.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.christophe...&lt;/a&gt; (just a few doors down from Modern Pizza) The first 8 of us to arrive have a table and the rest are on their own, although we'll hold onto nearby tables zealously until you arrive. We can sort of play it by ear once we arrive and maybe stay on for dinner or do whatever the mood drives us to. See you there, and as always feel free to call me anytime with questions at 802-233-9060.&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Nanette has a Birthday this week and I think we should take care of her bill in thanks for all the work she has done for us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259532341000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258998427000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christopher Martins Happy Hour</name><id>11939608</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259359200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/11939608/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
