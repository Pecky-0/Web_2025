Please bring a current cover letter and/or a description of a job that you are interested in.  We will write and edit our own Cover Letters with her assistance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 pm – General Meeting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us for our Professional Development Speaker and regularly scheduled meeting. We allot roughly 45 minutes for each speaker (usually 30 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes Q&amp;amp;A) then we begin the meeting at 8pm and discuss all the exciting happenings of the club! Come for one event, or both! All are welcome, so please feel free to bring a friend! We will likely head out for a drink or two after the meeting, so plan to make a night of it! :D&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk into 116 Beacon, down the hall &amp; take the stairs on the left going down.
