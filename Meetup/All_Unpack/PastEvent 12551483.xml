For our second-to-last film for this series we will be viewing &lt;b&gt;In Transtion 1.0: From Oil Dependence to Local Resilience&lt;/b&gt;. Produced by the Transition Network, it takes a fairly in-depth look at the birth, evolution and potential of Transition Initiatives.  This is a short film (at just less than an hour) so we will break after the film for refreshments and then into small groups for some focused discussion on resilience-building possibilities in our area.  We can expect to wrap up around 8:30 or 8:45 as usual! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about the movie:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘In Transition’ is the first detailed film about the Transition movement filmed by those that know it best, those who are making it happen on the ground. The Transition movement is about communities around the world responding to peak oil and climate change with creativity, imagination and humour, and setting about rebuilding their local economies and communities. It is positive, solutions focused, viral and fun.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a potluck event but feel free to bring a beverage or fruit or other treat to share and come anytime after 6:30pm for some social time if desired.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie will start sometime between 7:00 and 7:10pm.  &lt;b&gt;Short discussion to follow.&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Thank you to our friends at Zero Station for hosting the 2009|2010 Permaculture Movie Nights*&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268065488000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265649582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night: In Transition 1.0: From Oil Dependence to Local Resilience</name><id>12551483</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267574400000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/12551483/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/1/9/global_13006121.jpeg</photo_url></item>
