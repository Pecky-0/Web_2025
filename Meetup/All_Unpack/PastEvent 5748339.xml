I am in Los Angeles, and the airline rescheduled my flight for a later time on Sunday. Sorry! Because all of the RSVPs were Maybes, and now I'm a No for Sunday, we'll just do this on Saturday instead! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where? &lt;br /&gt;Starbucks on 443 Boylston at Berkeley. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who should come? &lt;br /&gt;Rational sojourners! Anyone with an interest in Ayn Rand who would like to meet fellow admirers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should people come?&lt;br /&gt;To meet &amp;amp; drink beverages &amp;amp; socialize &amp;amp; ponder A is A and man qua man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should members bring anything?&lt;br /&gt;Yourselves! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's a good ice-breaker question members can ask each other?&lt;br /&gt;What philosophies interested you before you learned of objectivism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will members find you when they get there?&lt;br /&gt;I'll have dollar-sign bling bling. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541392000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178489242000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand June Meetup</name><id>5748339</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181422800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/5748339/</event_url></item>
