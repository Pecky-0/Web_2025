We will walk three separate loops that if you do all three will end up being a total of six and a half miles. &lt;br /&gt;

Colt State Park (CSP) in Bristol is often referred to as the 'gem' of the RI State Parks System. The entire western border of the park is an open panorama onto Narragansett Bay. Open year round, the park offers four miles of bicycle trails passing along the Bay and through 464 acres of groomed fruit trees, carefully nurtured flowering bushes, and manicured lawns. Rich in history, it proudly displays ten large playing fields, a historical museum, six picnic groves containing 400+ picnic tables and its' popular open air Chapel-By-The-Sea. We will be meeting at five thirty at the statue of Senator Chafee across from the fishing pier parking lot in CSP. Send me an email titled," I read the write-up",so I know that you did in fact read this.Thanks. There is plenty of additional parking throughout the park. Colt State Park is located off Hope Street (Route 114) in Bristol, RI. Headed south on RI 114, turn right at the traffic light onto Asylum road and follow Asylum Rood as it bears left toward a rotary. Turn right at the rotary past a kiosk to enter the park and follow the park road (Colt Drive) to the parking lot just past the bridge. The (for some, elusive) statue of Senator Chaffee will be on the left and the parking lot is on the right. Afterwards, we'll go for a bite to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
