I know December is a busy time for people, so I hope everyone can make it!  I also changed the time to 10am (versus 11am), thinking that perhaps having the afternoon free will be more convenient (you'll still have time to get in some shopping, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location is going to be Creature Comforts in Salem.  This is the place that we have to pay $10 per family in advance.  We have to make sure we'll have enough people to make it worth the owner's while to open for us.  If we don't get enough people, we'll have to cancel.  (And in which case, your money will be refunded.)  You can pay me with PayPal (if you pay with PayPal, the cost is $10.61 because of their fee, and if we cancel, you will receive $10.00 back) or mail me a check, but payment &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; be received NLT Thursday, 12/11. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;-laura&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230996376000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225556131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel December Meetup</name><id>9071767</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229180400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/9071767/</event_url></item>
