This year, the Wishlist will benefit the Lowell Humane Society. Originally we had approached the Animal Rescue League of Boston to receive what is raised and we were encouraged by the ARL to reach out to another shelter in greater need, that being the Lowell Humane Society. We try to help shelters and pets in need in our community, but to have a shelter suggest we help another shelter speaks volume. Let's pull our resources and make this a wonderful 2008 holiday season for the folks in Lowell. All their hard-work and sacrifices to help these animals; and with the economy in the state it is in, more animals are being surrendered than placed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have not participated in the past or are new to our meet-ups, this is how it goes; on the Lowell Humane Society website, you will find a Wishlist,[I will get a direct link to the list]. The short of it is that they can use EVERYTHING! We are talking grocery store and office superstore gift cards, gift cards to pet stores, towels, blankets, bleach, hand sanitizer, the list goes on and on and on......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenge.....each meet-up group member can donate as much or as little as they wish. As a whole, the group to donate the most will win a private party at DoggieDay. To give you an idea of how groups come together, the first year, we raised approximately $4,000 in donations and merchandise; the Chihuahuas brought in the most for a single group at about $700. With the economy being in the state it is currently in, anything you can donate counts. If you cannot afford to buy or donate money, look around your home. Toys your pup or cat didn't take to, donate them; towels that you may have never used, donate them; Lightly used stainless steel furniture..... Keep in mind that dogs and cats are not the only animals in need; birds, rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets and other small animals need help, too. This is where the grocery store gift cards allow for the shelter to buy fresh fruits and veggies, rather than tap their limited funds, which can be used better, elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All donations will be made in your meetup group's name. We prefer donations are dropped off during your scheduled meeting so it is easier to track, however, we will accept donations from Friday, November 28th through Sunday, December 21st. Please no cash. If you plan on making a monetary donation, please bring a check or money order in the amount you wish to donate, making it payable to the Lowell Humane Society. In the memo field, write which meet-up group you are part of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you all know, meet-ups have always been free eventhough we pay fees to meetup.com to run them. We hope to have your donations express your appreciation for the groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thank everyone in advance and hope to see you all at meet-up, during the holiday season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rob&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2407140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232123913000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pug Devotee Extraordinaires</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-73</urlname><id>126274</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229443114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup from 12/06</name><id>9347181</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229796000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-73/events/9347181/</event_url></item>
