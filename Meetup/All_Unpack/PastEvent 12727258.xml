Some are full-blooded, some are half-blooded, and some are less than full-blooded wolves. These are often animals that were taken in as pets. Unfortunately wolves do not make good pets, and they often end up abused or homeless. They are often unable to survive in the wild once domestication has been attempted, so places such as Run with Wolves steps in to provide them with homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sanctuary is not for profit, and donations are highly encouraged. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;I would suggest you donate $10 to the Sanctuary on top of the $1 for the meetup.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Sanctuary is always looking for volunteers, and the person who runs it has a guestbook you can fill out with your name and information of what you can help with (cage cleaning, website design, animal feeding), etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are additional items the sanctuary is in need of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOOD &amp;amp; SUPPLIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Raw meat &amp;amp; bones (hunters, please don't forget us)&lt;br /&gt;- Adult and Senior formula, high-quality dog food (no dyes)&lt;br /&gt;- High quality canned dog food&lt;br /&gt;- Dog biscuits&lt;br /&gt;- Freezers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Paper towels&lt;br /&gt;- Ziplock freezer bags&lt;br /&gt;- Large trash can liners (39 gallons or larger)&lt;br /&gt;- Metal 30 gallon trash cans with lids&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless steel buckets&lt;br /&gt;- Disposable gloves (vinyl or Nutrile but no Latex);&lt;br /&gt;- Bales of straw for bedding (not hay); work gloves - all sizes;&lt;br /&gt;-Clean shavings and wood chips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST AID SUPPLIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Benadryl&lt;br /&gt;- Bandages&lt;br /&gt;- Peroxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll meet at my house, then all carpool over. There is minimal parking there and less vehicles are good to keep the animals calm.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at my house, then carpool 2 miles down the road to the sanctuary to reduce the number of cars as parking is limited at the sanctuary.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>8243578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274129731000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Out &amp; Abouters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Out-and-About-Group</urlname><id>1365436</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Out and About Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267306193000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Run with Wolves Sanctuary</name><id>12727258</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273939200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Out-and-About-Group/events/12727258/</event_url></item>
