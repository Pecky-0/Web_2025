&lt;p&gt;I am new to this. So here goes....I recently moved to North Andover and would love to find some hitting partners. I played tennis up until the college level and haven't really had much time to hit since I entered the "real world" of work two years ago. I am free Monday and Tuesday evenings and Saturday and Sunday mornings. I am willing to travel as well :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365871283000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-of-Boston-Tennis</urlname><id>1536131</id><group_lat>42.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>North of Boston Tennis</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364213752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play some Tennis!</name><id>110923932</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365859800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-of-Boston-Tennis/events/110923932/</event_url></item>
