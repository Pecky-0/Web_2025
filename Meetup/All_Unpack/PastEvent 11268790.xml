Kitt, Mensan and founder of the Kitt Research Initiative, as they discuss and debate the many varied parasciences from historical, intellectual, and spiritual perspectives.  Give them a listen from 9 PM to 10 PM every Thursday night, or participate directly by calling in!  There may be more to all this than you believe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week, A.J. and Beau will be talking about some of the unique experiences and circumstances surrounding the KRI's investigation of a house in Waterboro, ME. The site was previously investigated by Paranormal State, in which the host closed the show with the suggestion that this location would present more to come. He wasn't wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isabeauesby" target="_blank"&gt;Blog Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>www.blogtalkradio.com/isabeauesby</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabeau Esby</member_name><member_id>5847842</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252199339000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251906005000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intellectual Spirituality Radio Show</name><id>11268790</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252026000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/11268790/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/3/global_6795651.jpeg</photo_url></item>
