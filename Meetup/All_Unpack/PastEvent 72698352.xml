&lt;p&gt;We've been getting blueberries as part of our CSA weekly shares from Wards Berry Farm but have never been to their farm. We're planning to make a trip out to Sharon this Saturday morning to do some blueberries picking right at the source and a picnic afterwards. We decided to make it a meetup event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PYO blueberry patch OPEN daily from 9 AM - 5 PM &lt;br /&gt;

(or until picked out)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-pay for containers, berries included PINT BOX -- $3.00 each (holds approx. 1 lb. of berries)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW CARDBOARD HANDLE BASKET -- $8.00 each (holds approx. 3 PINTS of blueberries)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Ward's Berry Farm is a family farm located in Sharon, MA. Brothers Jim &amp;amp; Bob Ward have run the farm since 1982, offering the finest quality &lt;br /&gt;

fresh picked fruits and veggies. Their mother, Ann uses family favorite recipes to create her famous fruit jams and jellies, as well as the fresh cookies, muffins, breads and pies sold in the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our shelves are stocked with a large selection of gourmet grocery items and prepared foods to go. The store has an awesome sandwich &lt;br /&gt;

counter and deli, as well as a smoothie bar with soft-serve ice cream and slush. We also specialize in artisan breads, gourmet cheeses, homemade &lt;br /&gt;

jams and gift baskets made to order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spring &amp;amp; summer, bedding plants, hanging baskets and perennials fill our greenhouses. We offer pick-your-own strawberries, blueberries and pumpkins in season. There are public hayrides during strawberry &amp;amp; pumpkin seasons. Birthday parties &amp;amp; school tours are available year-round by reservation. We have many picnic areas, kids play areas and farm animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge yourself to our hay pyramid in the fall. For Thanksgiving, we offer fresh native turkeys and we have beautiful trees, wreaths and garlands for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tien Le</member_name><member_id>28187382</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342281650000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341896442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pick-Your-Own Blueberries @ Ward's Berry Farm</name><id>72698352</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342270800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/72698352/</event_url></item>
