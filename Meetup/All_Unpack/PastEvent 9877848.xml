The clubs offer year-round sporting and social activities individually and through the league in addition to skiing and winter outings.  There are a wide variety of membership options available for singles, couples and families among the clubs.  Members benefits include discounts on lift tickets, food, clothing, equipment and travel not only though EICSL, but through our membership in the National Ski Council Federation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eicsl.org" target="_blank"&gt;EICSL website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founded in 1961, the Wedeln Ski Club offers an all season retreat for winter sports; skiing, snowboarding, skating and climbing.
