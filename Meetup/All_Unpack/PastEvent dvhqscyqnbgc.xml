&lt;p&gt;In principle, the law of attraction seems like it should be so easy.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's that darn step of allowing that can be so tricky! &lt;img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/3039620944357886359/img/smileys/confused.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You "allow" what you want when you don't get in the Universe's way of bringing you what you desire, so to speak.  Don't know what I mean by this?  Then you'll definitely want to attend!  This is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important aspect of effectively using the law of attraction; so you want to thoroughly understand this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be doing a mix of this and that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a guided meditation to get into an allowing state,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discussing the essential elements of allowing and what it means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an exercise to connect to the wisdom of your body and your "emotional guidance system" as it relates to allowing, to raise your awareness of when you're allowing in an allowing state and when you're not, and to help you shift into allowing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some masterminding,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and an opportunity for some laser coaching, if you like, on issues you feel stuck about and would like to allow more easily.  &lt;span style="color : #000080"&gt;"Laser" coaching is a term used to refer to zeroing in or lasering in on a key point that will help you with the question/issue you bring in the short amount of time we have.&lt;/span&gt; Send us your questions, okay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to you joining us, and, remember, &lt;em&gt;we plan on it and prepare for you when you RSVP "yes".  Please be considerate and let us know if your plans change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note #2:&lt;/strong&gt; Through mid November, we're collecting &lt;strong&gt;non-perishable foods and clean, in good condition clothing&lt;/strong&gt; to donate to &lt;strong&gt;A Place to Turn&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides emergency food and clothing to those in need in about 30 towns in Metro West, MA.  This is totally voluntary.  No pressure.  If you feel inclined, please bring what you'd like to donate.  We're &lt;strong&gt;accepting financial donations, as well&lt;/strong&gt;; as there is great need on all counts.  Thank you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're down a long driveway.
