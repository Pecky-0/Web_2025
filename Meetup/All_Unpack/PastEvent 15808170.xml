Perhaps a courtroom drama?  A mystery?  A tragic romance?  Or?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can bring your proposal to discuss, or even bring a scene to read to the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Meetup will be divided into 3 parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story making, where we'll discuss reconstituted fairy tales and collaborate on writing a short scene for a novel.   For the scene, we'll focus on a serious dramatic story you might find in the middle of a novel.   What are the characters?  What are the issues?  How did we get to this point in the story?    The group will work this out in a lightly moderated discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second part of the Meetup, we'll discuss what fiction we are reading currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we have time, we'll go on to the third part, which is a &lt;b&gt;surprise!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Meetup location:&lt;/b&gt; The Watertown Public Library has been kind enough to allow us to use one of their meeting rooms.  This will allow for a discussion without a lot of outside noise.  The meeting room is on the second floor, it is the Lucia Mastrangelo Meeting Room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; 1PM - 4PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking:&lt;/b&gt; Behind the library is some parking which should be free on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;Also, behind the CVS is a large parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Find us up on the second floor in the glass meeting room with the tables and white board.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim B</member_name><member_id>1113365</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296089940000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293129538000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Story Making: Reconstituted Fairy Tales  </name><id>15808170</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295805600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/15808170/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/d/global_8294813.jpeg</photo_url></item>
