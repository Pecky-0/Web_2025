We will be sampling the new skin care products and makeup from Arbonne.  For those of you who like to start your Christmas shopping early this is your chance.  This is the first look at the Christmas line and trust me it is great!!!  As if that is not exciting enough we will also be cooking up burgers and dogs while we sip on whatever crazy drinks we mix up.  The last party was a great time so I hope to see you all there for this one.  Feel free to bring as many friends as you would like.  For each friend that you bring you will be entered to win a free gift!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products available for purchase the night of the party. &lt;br /&gt;Don't miss your chance to find your new face.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Please R.S.V.P. by Wednesday September 6th, even if you can't make it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3910727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540439000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialnetworking</urlname><id>251346</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1155221455000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BBQ and Beauty</name><id>5070669</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1157918400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialnetworking/events/5070669/</event_url></item>
