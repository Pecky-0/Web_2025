One of the most popular hikes in the lakes region, these two classic summits contains excellent views of the north and the south. To the north you can view Sandwich Mountain and some of the White Mountains. To the south lies an amazing view of Squam Lake and Lake Winnepausaukee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Morgan can be climb by the Mt. Morgan, which is easy class 1 trail at the bottom, and steepens toward the top. There is side trail, which is class 3 due to a tricky ladder climb and some boulder caving that lead to the summit views. If it is very icy or if this is out of comfort level stay on the class 1 trail, which contains a moderate grade to the summit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt. Pervical can be ascended via the class 1-2 Mt. Pervical trail. This trail begins similar to the Mt. Morgan trail. The trail though becomes steep toward the top with plenty of exposure and some scrambles. It also has a side path, which goes though a boulder cave and is difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the total loop is only 4.8 miles, the amount of adventures, from ladder climbing to going through boulder caves, and breathtaking views, make these summit a must on any New Hampshire hiking plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.summitpost.org/images/original/103583.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIA MOUNT MORGAN TRAILHEAD: From I-93 get of Exit 24 and head east through the town of Ashland.
