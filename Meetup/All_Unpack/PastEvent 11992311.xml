Sorry if this causes any inconvenience! We will meet Wednesday January 20th at 7:00. Hope to see you there!!&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our wonderful Allison has agreed to facilitate the next book club ~ Three Cups of Tea     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like, bring something to eat or drink to share. We look forward to seeing you there!!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three Cups of Tea by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin is the true story of Mortenson's work building schools in remote villages in Pakistan. Mortenson moves from a lost climber who promises a school to one small village to a major player in promoting peace through education in Pakistan and Afghanistan. His story is too crazy to be made up. Three Cups of Tea is good reading for anyone who wants to understand more about Central Asia and be inspired by what one humble person can do.&lt;/i&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>7932349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264375598000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259697306000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Date Change!!
