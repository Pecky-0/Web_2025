&lt;p&gt;Melissa Guimont will train volunteers to monitor the native bird nesting boxes in MSSF for anyone who couldn't make it to the first training session. Meet at the MSSF Headquarters Parking Lot at the "Interpretive Center" to carpool to the fields at 10:00. Please bring a notepad and pen, binoculars and a phillips head screwdriver. The training will last ~ 1.5 hours. If there is rain, we will reschedule it for a later date. We will send an email out to all those who sign up for rescheduling if the weather doesn't cooperate. We will be looking in the birdboxes and setting up a schedule for volunteers to check these boxes once a week from May-August. &amp;nbsp;Please attend if you have a birdbox in your yard that you need to monitor also!&lt;/p&gt;
