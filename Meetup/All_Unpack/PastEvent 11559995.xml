You asked for it...we're doing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An overnight stay at this great little town...visits to the Maylower II and the Plimoth Plantation...Wampanog Village and a special themed dinner at the Plantation where you will be treated to a meal of the day (1627), music and a chance to ask the Pilgrims questions about their way of living. What an experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will leave around 10:00 am on Friday, November 27th and check in at our hotel...The Governor Bradford Inn on the Harbour. From there we will visit Plimoth Plantation, where we will visit the &amp;quot;settlers&amp;quot; and have a chance to view their homes and ask questions. At 5:30 we will enjoy a great dinner of the period and the &amp;quot;settlers&amp;quot; will entertain, via stories, singing and answer your questions. It's a wonderful way to bond as Americans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, we can return to Plimoth Plantation (included in our dining ticket is a two day admission to the Plantation) or can visit Wampanog Village ...the Indian village near Plymouth...it is also included in your admission ticket. We can visit the Mayflower II sailing vessel manned with settlers, again to answer any questions you may have. They will be happy to share their experience as they came to &amp;quot;the new world&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, no visit here would be complete without a visit to THE PLYMOUTH ROCK...where the Maylower landed and passengers first stepped out to their new home. What a rush!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can then discuss possibilities of staying an additional night as there are more activities to enjoy in this &amp;quot;American HomeTown&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the activities, and prices...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1627 ENGLISH VILLAGE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1627 English Village is a re-creation of the small farming town built by English colonists in the midst of the Wampanoag homeland. Find yourself immersed in the year 1627, just seven years after the voyage of the Mayflower. In the village you will be surrounded by the modest timber-framed houses, fragrant raised-bed gardens, well-tended livestock and fascinating townspeople of Plymouth Colony, the first permanent English settlement in New England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people you will meet are costumed role players who have taken on the names, viewpoints and life histories of the people who actually lived in the colony in 1627, popularly known as the &amp;quot;Pilgrims&amp;quot; today. Each one has a unique story to tell. Learn about the colony's difficult beginnings or discover the gossip of the day. Ask about religious beliefs, medical practices or relations with the local Wampanoag People. Talk to a housewife and learn what a &amp;quot;pottage&amp;quot; is, or see how a duck or bluefish is cooked on the hearth. Help a young colonist pull up a few weeds in a cornfield, mix daub with your feet for a house under construction, or just relax on a bench enjoying the unique atmosphere of 17th-century New Plymouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1627 Themed Dinner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience a tasty bit of America's past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us in the year 1627 for an evening of entertainment and hospitality with the residents of the English Village. Sit down to a &amp;quot;groaning board&amp;quot; filled with finest food that this season of plenty has to offer. Discover the table manners that traveled across the Atlantic with the &amp;quot;Pilgrims,&amp;quot; (remember not to wipe your mouth with the tablecloth!) and find out about what really happened at the harvest celebration of 1621. During dinner, you will be entertained with psalms and songs and perhaps you will be convinced to join in singing a round or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill of Fare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Ciderkin &lt;br /&gt;•Cheate Bread and Butter &lt;br /&gt;FIRST COURSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•A Sallet &lt;br /&gt;•Mussels Seeth'd with Parsley and Beer &lt;br /&gt;•A Dish of Turkey, Sauc'd &lt;br /&gt;•A Pottage of Cabbage, Leeks &amp;amp; Onions &lt;br /&gt;•A Sweet Pudding of Native Corn &lt;br /&gt;SECOND COURSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Stewed Pompion &lt;br /&gt;•A Chine of Pork, Roast'd &lt;br /&gt;•Fricassee of Fish &lt;br /&gt;•Cheesecake made with spice and dried fruit &lt;br /&gt;•A Charger of Holland Cheese &amp;amp; Fruit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAMPANOG HOMESITE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people you will meet at the Wampanoag Homesite talk of the past, but their story is also a very current one, told from a modern perspective. Step into a traditional wetu (house) and enter a world that may be new and unfamiliar to you. Surrounded by soft furs, flickering firelight, and artfully woven bulrush mats, learn about traditional Wampanoag family life as well as the arrival of the English from an Indigenous point of view. Walk around outside and enjoy the scent of sobaheg (stew) as it simmers over an aromatic wood fire. Discover traditional Wampanoag plant remedies or help scrape out a mishoon (boat) using centuries-old techniques. Gaze upon the tranquil waters of the Eel River and take this time to glimpse the world of the Wampanoag in the 1600s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wampanoag People have lived in southeastern New England for over 12,000 years. the Wampanoag Homesite explores the story of one 17th-century Wampanoag man, Hobbamock, as well as traditional Wampanoag culture and history. Take this unique opportunity to explore the perspectives of the Indigenous Wampanoag who have lived on this land for hundreds of generations. You may be surprised at what you learn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that unlike the 1627 English Village, there are no &amp;quot;characters&amp;quot; here; the staff dressed in traditional deerskin clothing are Native People and speak in their own modern words about the experiences of the Wampanoag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAYFLOWER II:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visiting Mayflower II is an extraordinary experience. The details of the ship, from the solid oak timbers and tarred hemp rigging, to the wood and horn lanterns and hand-colored maps, have all been carefully recreated to give you a sense of what the original 17th-century vessel was like. Come aboard and learn about the 1620 voyage of the Mayflower, the perils of maritime travel, and the tools of 17th-century navigation. Explore the cramped quarters of the ship's passengers. Peer down into the lower level &amp;quot;hold,&amp;quot; where the food, clothing, furniture, tools and other items necessary to start a colony were stored. Admire the &amp;quot;spacious&amp;quot; Master's cabin, and compare it to the wet and windy accommodations of the common sailors. You will also hear the tale of a modern Englishman's dream to build and sail Mayflower II as a symbol of American and British unity after WWII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mayflower II has many stories to tell and many people to tell them. You will meet staff in modern-day clothing who speak from a present-day perspective. They can talk with you about the original Mayflower as well as the reproduction vessel Mayflower II. Along side are reproductions of a 17th-century shallop and a ship's boat. You may recognize this ship's boat from the Emmy-nominated PBS series Colonial House or the recent feature film, The New World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On board, you may also meet role players in period costume who will share their personal accounts of shipboard life, playing the part of Mayflower passengers (popularly known as the “Pilgrims”) or sailors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step aboard, breathe in the sea air and experience the many fascinating stories of two historic Mayflowers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your admission ticket price is only ...Adult: $60.95&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices include museum admission and tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Museum admission includes: the Wampanoag Homesite, 1627 English Village, Mayflower II, Crafts Center, and Nye Barn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a Bargain for 2 days activities!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOVERNOR BRADFORD INN ON THE HARBOUR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Plymouth and the Governor Bradford Inn on the Harbour!
