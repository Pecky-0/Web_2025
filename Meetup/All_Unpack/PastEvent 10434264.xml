<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will be hosting a traditional game night at Damata's Pizza in Salem. Damata's has been eager to have another game event hosted there and they are very accommodating. The food is great and reasonable. (We do request at Meetups held at service venues that each person attending at least order one item: food or beverage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also plenty of free parking. Should you be coming from outside of Salem, just remember that Damata's is on Bridge St., not the Bridge St. Bypass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your favorite board game to play.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1244503944000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242610686000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game night at Damata's</name><id>10434264</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243895400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/10434264/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/7/d/global_5891501.jpeg</photo_url></item>
