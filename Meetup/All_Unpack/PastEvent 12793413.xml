Come to relax and align with who you really are and to open yourself to the joy in all that you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, all you'll have to do is listen to my voice as I guide you through the 2- 3 meditations, each one usually about 15 - 20 minutes long, with discussions in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is always a most wonderful evening, and I look forward to BEing with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're plans change after you RSVP, &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt; let us know so we won't be waiting unnecessarily for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like, you can bring a mat, blanket, and pillow to fully relax lying down.  Or you can use our chairs, too, of course.  &lt;u&gt;Please arrive a little early to get settled.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll begin at 7:15 pm, and end around 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome, so invite your friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm heart,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269213570000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267812142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE Evening of Guided Meditations and Being Who You Truly Are</name><id>12793413</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269040500000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/12793413/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/4/global_5412564.jpeg</photo_url></item>
