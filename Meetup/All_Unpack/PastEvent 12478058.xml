<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hey Canucks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the location change and extra (final) email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the number of RSVPs, I am switching the location of Sunday's USA v Canada to the Greatest Bar, near TD Garden.  Champions had a hard time accommodating us, needed a deposit, and required us to purchase a fair amount of food and drink, and it's more expensive there.  So I shopped around, and the Greatest Bar with their 14 foot HD tv have no stipulations. Just show up eat, drink what you want and cheer on the red and white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 7pm, for food, drink, and good hockey. Make sure you update your RSVP so I have a general idea of the numbers the bar is to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are taking the T like me, take the green line inbound to North Station. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thegreatestbar.com/sportsbar.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go! Canada Go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Wear something identifiable as Canadian if you can. Doesn't have to be red/white with the flag on it, anything at all. University shirt, t-shirt of a region, city etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Canadian flag</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bruce Turnbull</member_name><member_id>4018534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266970276000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>90</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264984679000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canada vs USA at The Greatest Bar</name><id>12478058</id><headcount>91</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266796800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/12478058/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/4/1/global_12885905.jpeg</photo_url></item>
