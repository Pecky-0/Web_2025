It was another great meeting - we learned (and practiced) a technique from Richard Bandler which used submodalities to reduce anxiety.  We also revisited the Circle of Excellence, where new people created their circle, and those who already had them added even more resources.  There was also a lot of interesting conversation touching on the many aspects of NLP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For December: for the last meetup of the year, we've got a full schedule of new (and old) techniques.  Responding to some of last month's feedback, which can be summed up as &amp;quot;less talking, more doing&amp;quot; we'll be doing as many of the following techniques as we can fit into two hours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-          Well-Formed Outcomes (just in time for those New Year's Resolutions and 2008 business goals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-         Several Language Patterns (I wonder just how much these new patterns that you will learn will have successfully shifted your world since you?ve learned them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-          Advanced Technique ? successful grieving process (combining timelines, metaphor, and presuppositions) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-          And More!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that there may also be cookies or other signs of holiday cheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December's NLP meetup does not presuppose that you know anything about NLP. Everyone is welcome, from beginners to experts.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I?m Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;Andover-Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
