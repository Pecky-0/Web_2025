It is discussion and stock tips. Many of our members value open discussion highly. The informal format gives all members an opportunity to express and share ideas and opinions. Since the Wednesday meeting has a tighter agenda - with scheduled speakers - the Tuesday meeting is currently intended to have a free exchange of questions and knowledge. All levels of expertise are welcome. No question is too simple - as a matter of fact the simplest question often evokes the best discussion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time this agenda can change as new needs become apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Location: MIT Building E51. MIT, 77 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA, USA.&lt;br /&gt;(This building is on the far eastern side of the MIT&lt;br /&gt;campus, about a ten minute walk from the main entrance,&lt;br /&gt;and about two minutes from the Kendall Square 'T' stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a free meeting. There is no membership required.&lt;br /&gt;Show full description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When and Where:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Tuesday, March 13, 2007 at 7:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;    MIT E51, Boston , MA 02101&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff Orrik</member_name><member_id>1135788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175180465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Investor$ who think 4 themselve$</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonIBD</urlname><id>81154</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Investor's Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171478538000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Investors Business Daily Tuesday Meetup</name><id>5481455</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1173826800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonIBD/events/5481455/</event_url></item>
