They want to change her and never let her go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Coraline will have to fight with all her wit and courage if she is to save herself and return to her ordinary life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it's all wet and rainy, let's just shoot for Au Bon Pain in Harvard Square.  There's still a slim chance I may miss this one, but will keep you posted and want to get us reading regardless:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy reading:-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lugging the ol' pink comforter</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246212273000</updated><rating><average>4.38000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243940355000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Readers:  Coraline by Neil Gaiman</name><id>10553432</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245711600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/10553432/</event_url></item>
