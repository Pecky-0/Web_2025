We’ll focus on character development, since strong, varied characters contribute to the believability of a scene. Our challenge: creating these characters in the spontaneous, audience-driven scenes that we perform. After some drillwork, we’ll introduce a few new structured games. Practicing these games will give us a further taste of future performances. This will be a productive and fun rehearsal, as much as a challenging one. Get your rest, drink your coffee, and bring your actor’s impulse. As a heads up, I'll be taking a few photos during this rehearsal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: We are officially on for 5:00-7:00 pm.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244076272000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238204949000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meeting 4: Character, Character, Character</name><id>10053454</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238360400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/10053454/</event_url></item>
