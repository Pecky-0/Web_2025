For others, in search of rushing waterfalls, April is the prime viewing month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the abundant water from record breaking amounts of melting snow there is no better season for viewing and photographing waterfalls, rushing brooks, streams, and rivers than April and May. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere in New England are waterfalls more abundant and accessible for viewing than Mt. Washington Valley in New Hampshire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/e/highres_1564910.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: &lt;br /&gt;9:45 for a 10 AM start&lt;br /&gt;Where: &lt;br /&gt;14.5 miles from Rte 3 on Rte 302&lt;br /&gt;.5 mile south from the Dry River Campground&lt;br /&gt;turn right and drive to the end of the Spur Rd&lt;br /&gt;The hike:&lt;br /&gt;A nice easy to lightly moderate hike to see the swirling circular Fawn Pool, Coliseum Falls, Bemis Brook Falls and the magnificent Arethusa Falls, the highest waterfall in the state!  All this in under 1.3 miles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll continue on the gentle Arethusa-Riley Falls Trail to the summit of Frankenstein Cliff (named for a very famous 18th century landscape artist) were we may see Peregrine Falcons.  There are 3 tremendous view points of most of the surrounding spectacular mountains from this beautiful cliff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/4/event_1564916.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This excellent loop hike has many wonderful features in its short 4.7 miles, 1600' of elevation gain, with all the photo opportunities and the many features and views, it should be completed in about 5 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will agree on an after hike location for food and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Green escort sedan, NH plates. cell phone 603-477-5116</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208882668000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><why>Welcome spring!
