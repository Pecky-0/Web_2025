This week the focus will be on our career and life passion.  Here is a description of the workshop from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€œNot only is the Enneagram a great tool for personal growth and relationship dynamics, it's also a great tool to explore your work and career passions. What work environments fits your type and which don't. What careers are best suited for your type?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a sliding scale from $20-40 but for Unique People it is $15-40. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00 it helps the presenter and those who might pay less. No one is turned away because of money, so pay what you can honestly afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcome to bring vegetarian appetizers and drinks, including wine.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** About Herb Pearce **&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce is an Arlington-based, individual, couples and family therapist, with over 30 years experience.
