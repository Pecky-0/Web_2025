Liz and Danny are university juniors who have just moved in together. Athletic Pam and her husband, Nick, a sports instructor, have had some trouble conceiving. Arlene, already the mother ...of three grown daughters, is unsure of what to do, contemplating abortion while her husband Alan is thrilled with the thought of a new baby. Throughout the show, these characters experience the emotional stresses and triumphs, the desperate lows and the comic highs, that accompany the anticipation and arrival of a baby.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacki</member_name><member_id>6777705</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280614044000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279414402000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Musical at Tatnuck</name><id>14133288</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280530800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/14133288/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/e/3/global_16487091.jpeg</photo_url></item>
