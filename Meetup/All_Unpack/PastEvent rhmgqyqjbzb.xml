 On the Dangers of Agenda 21 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;

 INTRODUCTION OF AGENDA 21: "Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced — a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level." &lt;br /&gt;
