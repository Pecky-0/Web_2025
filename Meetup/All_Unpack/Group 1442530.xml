Our coaches are devoted to getting you in the best shape of your life in a non-intimidating, fun, and safe environment.

Ask anyone who has completed their goal of getting in shape to complete a half or full marathon, and I'm sure they will tell you it has truly changed their life. You will feel more fit, happier, and mentally much stronger; and all in a short 24 weeks.

Important note:  We are a seasonal training program and there is a fee to join ($90 for marathon program, $120 for ATP program, $130 for triathlon program).   The 2010 training starts May 8th.  You can register either on our website (www.bostonfit.net) or via check/cash on the morning of May 8th.     We then meet regularly as a group until the completion of the respective events. 

Much more information is on our website, at: www.bostonfit.net.   

If this is right for you, we look forward to seeing you! 

Sincerely,
Debbie</description><rating>4.93</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1240599137000</created><lat>42.3600006104</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>401</id><urlkey>marathon</urlkey><name>Marathon</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1155</id><urlkey>triathlon</urlkey><name>Triathlon</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2516</id><urlkey>running</urlkey><name>Running</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15394</id><urlkey>group-fitness-training</urlkey><name>Group Fitness Training</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17195</id><urlkey>marathon-and-half-marathon-training-program</urlkey><name>Marathon and Half Marathon training program</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17323</id><urlkey>half-marathon</urlkey><name>Half Marathon</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17591</id><urlkey>triathlon-training</urlkey><name>Triathlon Training</name></topics_item></topics><name>Boston Fit Marathon, Half Marathon, and Triathlon Training</name><id>1442530</id><members>94</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>9425319</member_id><name>Debra Brendemuehl</name></organizer><urlname>BostonFit</urlname><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFit/</link><lon>-71.0500030518</lon></item>
