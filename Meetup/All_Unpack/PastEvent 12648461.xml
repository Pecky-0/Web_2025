Let's meet at 6:45pm to purchase tickets/get in line. The movie starts at 7pm. Here are more details about the movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Philippe Lioret&lt;br /&gt;France | 2008 | 110 mn &lt;br /&gt;Cast: Vincent Lindon, Fyat Ayverdi, Audrey Dana &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x942bcMf0oM" target="_blank"&gt;View trailer&lt;/a&gt; (in French)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bilal, a 17-year-old Kurdish youth, has traveled through the Middle East and Europe to join his girlfriend, who has recently emigrated to England with her family. But his journey comes to an abrupt end when he is stopped on the French side of the Channel. Having decided to swim across, Bilal goes to the local swimming pool to train. There he meets Simon, a swimming instructor in the midst of a divorce. To impress his wife and win back her heart, Simon decides to risk everything by taking Bilal under his wing. This film describes the daily struggles of ordinary French citizens who defy French authorities by helping illegal immigrants and portrays with brutal honesty the lives of the refugees trying to reach the UK from France.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie tickets are $8.50, or $50 for 8 general admissions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the group decides so, we can go out for a late night snack and/or drinks afterwards. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267487471000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266601384000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Welcome // French Film Festival</name><id>12648461</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267314300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/12648461/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
