It's been a while since we've met, so let's meet up.  (Hey...people from meetup.com meeting up.  What a concept!)  It seems the brunch idea was popular last time, so let's try it again (thanks Emilie!)  This time, we'll meet at Mike's City Diner in the South End.  This place has been rated pretty highly by the Phantom Gourmet.  If people want, we can then go to my place, about 5 blocks away, and play cards, other games, hang out, do whatever.  I know it's right before Christmas, but if you're still here, please join us!  Oh, and the city is Boston; it's not showing up in the address properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian B.</member_name><member_id>4457375</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204138607000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Midwesterners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Midwesterners</urlname><id>545362</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ex-Midwesterners Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196360884000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December brunch</name><id>6825684</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198434600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Midwesterners/events/6825684/</event_url></item>
