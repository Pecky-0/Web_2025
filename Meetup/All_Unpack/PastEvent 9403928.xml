<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>To create a seamless 3-needle bind-off simply hold the wrong sides together in your left hand with the points toward the right.  Take a 3rd needle and insert it into the needle closet to you as if to knit.  Then insert it into the far needle as if to knit.  Knit both stitches onto the 3rd needle together.  Repeat and then pass the first stitch over the latter (like a regular bind off).  Continue until all stitches are bound off.  Remember both pieces need to have live stitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fiber fact and many more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we have a knit night coming up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244900645000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230589841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Unwound - Wednesday June 10th</name><id>9403928</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244673000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/9403928/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/e/f/global_6768495.jpeg</photo_url></item>
