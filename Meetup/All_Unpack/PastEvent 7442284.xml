Fasika Ethiopian Restaurant is known to have very authentic Ethiopian food and I've heard its delicious.  Apparently, the Ethiopian Running Team goes here after the Boston Marathon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The menu at Fasika includes highly seasoned stews and fried meats, served atop an edible platter of injera (a spongy, pancake-like flatbread). Diners sit on tiny stools around intricately woven basket tables.  There is a large selection of vegetarian dishes, and Honey wine and cardamom-flavored coffee are among the drink options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her is a link to the menu: &lt;a href="http://www.fasikarestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fasikarest...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I chose this restaurant instead of another more popular Ethiopian restaurant because this restaurant can handle a larger reservation.  However, even though the food is very good, Fasika is known to have little atmosphere and shares the restaurant with a bar that get very noisy.  However, the food makes up for the lack of atmosphere and noise.  The restaurant also only takes cash, but there is an ATM machine.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting out front of the restaurant.
