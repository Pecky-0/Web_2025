It is a nice venue (4 stars on Meetup) and does not get really crowded until after 10PM.  People can stay as late as they want but we will start gathering at 8PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will be completely unstructured, just an opportunity to meet new people in an informal setting.  Felt also has pool tables on the second level.  Please RSVP so that I know how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will take over as much of the second floor as we can.  Go up the stairs by the entrance to join our group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will take over as much of the second floor as we can.
