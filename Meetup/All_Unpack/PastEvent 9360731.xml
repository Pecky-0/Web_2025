Here are the details of the January meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a reminder: we start the meeting at 6:30 for those new to NLP, those who want a review, and those who want to come early to socialize/network.  At 7pm we will jump into the main event for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main event(s) : Time Travel and Goal Setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To kick off 2009, we're going to utilize a series of NLP techniques that have to do with &amp;quot;time travel&amp;quot; and goal-setting (note that we did the same process last January, with great results): &lt;br /&gt;- We'll start with a guided Trans-Derivational search (review) of 2008, gathering up lessons learned in the past year. &lt;br /&gt;- We'll use those learnings to generate Well-Formed Outcomes (can't-miss goals) for 2009. &lt;br /&gt;- We'll then &amp;quot;Walk our Timelines&amp;quot; for 2009 to see more clearly how our well-formed outcomes come into reality in the coming year. &lt;br /&gt;- Finally (if we have time), we'll use Circles of Excellence to give ourselves access to the internal resources that will be most useful to us in 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great opportunity to learn (or review) a highly useful set of NLP techniques, while accomplishing some important planning for yourself for the coming year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to work on specific issues you are having that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;We meet on the first floor of Sturtevant Hall, 197 Herrick Road, which is near the library on the central quad of Andover Newton. &lt;br /&gt;Andover Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
