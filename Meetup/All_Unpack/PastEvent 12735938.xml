Same bat time same bat channel. Okay, sorry about the Bat Man analogies, but I'm still on a high from our great day of skating today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rink is closing for the season soon, so let's skate one more time before they lock up for another season. The venue was great, so we'll skate there again. Admission is FREE! Yes, I said FREE! Rentals are $5. Public skate is from 2PM - 3:50PM, so let's try to be there by 1:45 to rent or put on our skates. I will probably be there between 1:30 and 1:45 to welcome all attendees that arrive on time. If you are late, just meet us on the ice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress in layers, and don't forget gloves, hats, ear muffs or whatever else you may need to stay warm. You do tend to warm up the more you skate, so that is why I suggest layers. Bring $ for snacks or a beverage for the snack shop if desired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no longer a fee to attend these events, but if you would like to make a donation toward Julie's cost to run the group, feel free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will only be canceled in the event of a major snow storm or if there is not a minimum of 4 yes RSVP's by the day of the event (including organizer). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alison&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear my red fleece again and hair up in a pony tail.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268880993000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267394950000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Shall we skate?</name><id>12735938</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268588700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/12735938/</event_url></item>
