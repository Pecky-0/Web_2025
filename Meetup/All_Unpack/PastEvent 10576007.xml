The event was not created by the Boston Atheists, and the description is taken from their  &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=84935844500" target="_blank"&gt;facebook event page. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;If you've heard the black hole scares surrounding the LHC or seen the movie Angels &amp;amp; Demons and wondered if any bit of it had basis in reality, you're in for a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shulamit Moed is a post-doc who splits her time between Fermilab (where she measures the production of the charm quark), CERN (where she prepares for the first LHC collisions), and Harvard (where she gives talks in pubs to people like you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub is an informal lecture series where everyone is invited to hang out, socialize, drink, eat, and maybe even learn something. Each lecture is followed by a rousing Q&amp;amp;A session and then several hours of drinking and socializing that sometimes evolves into Harvard Square bar-hopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lecture begins around 7pm, but show up anytime after 6:30 to get good seats!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246805049000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244136088000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Skeptics in the Pub: Particle Collidersâ€”The Science &amp; The Fiction</name><id>10576007</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246316400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/10576007/</event_url></item>
