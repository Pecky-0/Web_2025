She uses humor to help us see how we take ourselves too seriously and how we can laugh and enjoy life more. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;One night I greeted Bob at the door wearing nothing but his winged tip shoes. I was laughing hysterically at how I looked. Bob did not crack a smile. Instead he bellowed, &amp;quot;What are the neighbors going to think?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don't know,&amp;quot; I replied, &amp;quot;I haven't shown them yet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for a fun filled night of Loretta. You can purchase tickets online at www.palacetheatre.org or call the theatre at 603-668-5588. Tickets are $38.00 and $58.00. The $58.00 tickets include a pre show VIP meet and greet with Loretta. We are planning to have dinner before the show and meet at Tiya's Thai 8 Hanover St. Manchester at 6:00. There is on street parking with meters and a parking garage across from the theatre.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We can meet at the restaurant .</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272327387000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270512998000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lighten Up with Loretta LaRoche</name><id>13097186</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272153600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/13097186/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/8/global_13798104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
