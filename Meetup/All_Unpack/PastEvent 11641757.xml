C'mon out!!  We'll meet from &lt;b&gt;5:00-7:30pm&lt;/b&gt; in the North Station area.  Stop by whenever possible within this window.  We will be upstairs at &lt;b&gt;BOSTON BEERWORKS&lt;/b&gt;.   (I appreciate the commented-on and emailed-in votes!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. You do not need to have tickets to the game to attend this meeting, in fact I don't have tickets myself.&lt;br /&gt;p.p.s. There is a Bruins' Pub Crawl going on at the same time in the area.  I've gone on their last 2 crawls so I can tell you from experience the place will be crawling with hockey fans of all ages, though mostly beer-guzzling males.  WARNING: &lt;b&gt;Not a good idea to drive in for this one.&lt;/b&gt;  I highly recommend public transportation!!!  Don't say I didn't warn you...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Upstairs near the pool tables in a Whaler's Hockey Jersey #44  [White background w/blue &amp; green lettering]</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257804995000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255709537000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bruins vs Sabres Pre-Party</name><id>11641757</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257631200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/11641757/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/d/global_9267149.jpeg</photo_url></item>
