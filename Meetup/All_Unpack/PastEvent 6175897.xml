I can not begin to THANK Lettie enough for taking the initiative and energy in putting together what will be a marvelous outing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lettie says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Cala's is very easily accessible by train from North Station....Rockport Line to Manchester by the Sea .... across the street from the train station.  After a delicious brunch and good spirits I thought maybe we can all walk to the Harbor, Masconomo Park and then up to Singing Beach, all within two walking blocks. It is called Singing beach because when you walk on the sand it squeaks and when it is windy it sings  :-D FOR REAL..!!! I'm not making this up... Seriously, it is a Great Beach, (note there is a $5 per person access fee) with white sand, lifeguards and bathhouse so everyone can bring a bathing suit and if you dear he, he, he, and I WILL dear everyone ... to go in the water  :-D C'mon it is cold (about 68*) I won't lie to you but once you pass the AAoooops..!!! it is NICEEEE..!!! and you might not want to get out of the water like when you were four years old.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.calasrestaurant.com/pdf/menus/Brunch.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Brunch Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/partners/worldnow/necn/landingpage.html?clipid=1467855&amp;amp;topVideoCatNo=80776&amp;amp;c=80776&amp;amp;autoStart=true&amp;amp;activePane=info&amp;amp;LaunchPageAdTag=homepage" target="_blank"&gt;Diner for a Day Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.calasrestaurant.com/pdf/directions.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Driving Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.manchester.ma.us/Pages/ManchesterMA_Recreation/singingbeach" target="_blank"&gt;Singing Beach Info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following MEMBER GUIDELINES were developed so our events run smoothly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our focus is on friendly and respectful gatherings while sharing a delicious meal.&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax as well as the $5 beach access fee.&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.&lt;br /&gt;***If you RSVP YES you MUSt add a comment whether you'll arrive via car or train with train number as well as if you'll join for the post brunch beach walk .***&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to travel on the commuter rail from North Station on Sunday the trains are 2101 which leaves at 8:30am and arrives in Manchester at 9:19am and 2105 which leaves at 10:15am and arrives in Manchester at 11:05am.&lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the event and you have not attended the event, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;br /&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO after 11:30am Saturday August 18th, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;br /&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW it will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events you are removed from the group.&lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the event and you are not able to attend or are running late, you must text or call me at (617) 445-7549.&lt;br /&gt;An email from you explaining your absence or less than twenty-four hour change, is an expected courtesy.&lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment requesting to be placed on wait list.&lt;br /&gt;If this event is full and you wish to attend, please RSVP NO with a comment to be wait listed.&lt;br /&gt;Your feedback is appreciated, so please rate the event and venue by completing the surveys after the events.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190079150000</updated><rating><average>4.92999982834</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187054660000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cala's Brunch and the Beach</name><id>6175897</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187537400000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/6175897/</event_url></item>
