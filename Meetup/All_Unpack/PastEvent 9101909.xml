So my &lt;br /&gt;dogs and I will still be going to the park and hope you can make it also. So &lt;br /&gt;the meetup will still be on. See you there, bring your rain coat and boots. &lt;br /&gt;What's a bit of rain anyway??? &lt;br /&gt;jennifer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be playing at the park Saturday afternoon for a few hours if you'd like to join us. The dogs have such a blast here and I think the humans do also. So if you can, come by for a bit or an hour. Bring water, treats, TOYS. ( perhaps some rubber balls...HA HA) If we do have really bad weather I will cancel, so check the website before leaving home. Hope to see you at the park.
