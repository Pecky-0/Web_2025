Special thanks to all who got involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This next meeting I thought we'd discuss the &amp;quot;Winter Blahs&amp;quot; and how to fight them with photography! So if anyone has been shooting, bring that work to show off. We can talk about anything and everything that helps get us out of the winter blues. Let also plan our next click and shoot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing everyone again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Scott and I are always to try to greet everyone who comes to the meetups.
