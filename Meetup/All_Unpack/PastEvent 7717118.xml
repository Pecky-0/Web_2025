Becca and Susanna, classically-trained cellists, both went to the Oberlin Conservatory, but only really got to know each other a decade later at the party of a mutual friend in Watertown. A fan of hiking and cool acoustics, the friend suggested that the two bring their cellos on a hike and then play some tunes in a ravine. The prospect of turning antiques into kindling didn't thrill the cellists, so instead they decided to start playing duos at friends' parties, getting paid in chocolate and compliments. It was the usual string stuff: Bach, Handel, Mozart. But they also tried out a couple of Beatles arrangements that Susanna had been working on. The audience loved them. Emboldened, the Cello Chix started showing up at Open Mic Night at the Burren, replaced their antique cellos with electric ones, ditched the Mozart, and soon got gigs playing oldies and newbies at bars around town. It was there--at Toad, specifically--where they met Nancy, a drummer and FOAF. Nancy brings over twenty years of playing and gigging experience--plus a certain je ne sais quois--to the band. The Cello Chix now have a repertoire of over 40 classic rock, jazz, pop and Latin tunes, a loyal and sizeable following, and a CD I have &amp;quot;Under the covers&amp;quot; that came out on 2/8/08.
