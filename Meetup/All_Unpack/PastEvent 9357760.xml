<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Put on your thinking caps, search your memory banks, peruse your old notes, and bring your ideas for topics you'd like to discuss throughout 2009 to the meeting. Whatever suits your fancy... technical analysis, fundamentals, sentimental indicators, specific strategies, entries, exits, money management, trading plans, various Gurus and their approaches, book reviews, favorite stocks, or any of the various resources available. Any level from newbie to advanced and anything in between is fair game. The purpose is to ensure meetings are of interest to as many attendees as possible, and to encourage membership growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an additional point of interest (and a back up topic for discussion), I would ask everyone to think about what their expectations are for their own trading during 2009. This is something that should be in place before the new year actually begins... that is, if you're really a serious trader. &lt;br /&gt;For example: What markets will you follow/trade? Do you plan to learn new strategies (if so, how many, and which ones)? What sort of profit targets (as a percentage of your total portfolio) have you set for yourself (... I'll bet you hadn't before I wrote that had you)? How will you keep your losses under control? How will you know if you're successful or not (a.k.a. - what will you use as metrics)? What conventions, seminars, and/or other group functions do you plan to attend throughout the year? Do you have a plan for improving your trading/investing education? I think you get the picture &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so  if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! &lt;br /&gt;Ray&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy working the laptop &amp; projector set up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raymond Dreczko</member_name><member_id>4521820</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234992495000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>IBD Enthusiasts and Traders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ibd-739</urlname><id>559772</id><group_lat>41.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229603954000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Charlestown Investor's Business Daily Forum January Meetup</name><id>9357760</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232578800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ibd-739/events/9357760/</event_url></item>
