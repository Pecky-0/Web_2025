There's a commuter rail station there and it's convenient to Rt. 2.  I'd be interested in hosting it at 1pm this Sunday 7/27.  It's a 30 mile ride.  We'll do an avg pace of 12 mph and my wife will be the sweep so no one is left behind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/ride/united-states/ma/ayer/562052792" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapmyride....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: We are open to other members running events however we want you to know that we do no know of Matt's experience in leading rides.  However, he did pick out a nice ride map program above that I like!  I may attend this event....  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Fox&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rob Fox</member_name><member_id>4368625</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217351629000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216824598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Group Member Wants To Lead A Ride in Ayer Mass</name><id>8395851</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217178000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/8395851/</event_url></item>
