Mozilla are about to release the  and  tags over the next couple of weeks in Firefox 3.5. Christopher Blizzard from Mozilla asked Al to create a couple of Javascript demos for the release project ("35 Days").  He thought it would be fun to show the group what he's been doing and give members a basic starter on how to access the new media capabilities of the browser with Javascript. (As well as demonstrate how easy it is to make interactive visualizations with Processing.js.)

Take a look at some of Al's Processing.js experiments here, remember this is all Javascript. No Flash:  &lt;a href="http://www.hyper-metrix.com/processing-js/docs/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.hyper-metrix.com/processing-js/docs/&lt;/a&gt;.

Bring your laptops as you will be able to interact with Al's presentation in real-time.

After the presentation | demonstration, we will go around the room introducing ourselves and asking the group for advice | opinions on any JavaScript-related issues members are facing.
