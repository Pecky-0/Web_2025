If you can't attend, but are still interested in future meetings and events, please send your email and we will add you to the list. We will have human and doggie treats, and doggie entertainment. We will ask for donations to help pay for subscription fees (currently $19/mo), but it's not required. October 20 is also our Gwendolyn's 3rd birthday!! Party hats for all who promise not to eat them.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb Muise</member_name><member_id>3834061</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193073175000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Small Dog Breed Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-136</urlname><id>727218</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Massachusetts Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191432114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Massachusetts Small Breed Dogs October Meetup</name><id>6479815</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192899600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-136/events/6479815/</event_url></item>
