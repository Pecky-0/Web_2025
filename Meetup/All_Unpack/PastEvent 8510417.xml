We are holding it on Saturday, June 14th, the same day we are holding our Summer Pet Fest.  This is a huge community event that has lots of games, activities, contests and fun for your pet and family!  There will be several local rescue groups on hand with adoptable pets as well as an agility course, Canine Good Citizen demonstrations and a low cost MicroChipping clinic provided by Water's Edge Veterinary Hospital.  We have many raffle and silent auction items available with all proceeds going to the rescue groups in attendance.  Refreshments and entertainment also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great summer event where all pets are more than welcome to attend!  Please let all of your friends know too!  We hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held at Best Friends Pet Care off of Rt-97 less than a mile from I-95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223741987000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218305358000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs September Meetup</name><id>8510417</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221325200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/8510417/</event_url></item>
