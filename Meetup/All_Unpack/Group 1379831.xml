You have faced obstacles, heartbreak, and triumphs while raising your children, caring for your husbands or significant others, parents, and have done it all on a shoe string budget at that!

The purpose of this group is to share support, and to be spiritually uplifting for each other going through various changes, and challenges in life.  
We will create a place designed to provide a warm, comfortable atmosphere to share, and to offer outreach to other women in the community.  We can plan events, trips, dinners, as well as donating time, and efforts to others in need.

If you are like me, you will have amazing information and skills to offer, and will be able to lend a helping hand when needed.  You will also be able to look for support from others to create balanced relationships, and mutual support for our individual and community goals.

This forum is open to all of your ideas, and thoughts to creating a purposeful experience together.</description><rating>4.81</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1234269443000</created><lat>42.6800003052</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>713</id><urlkey>diningout</urlkey><name>Dining Out</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4422</id><urlkey>socialnetwork</urlkey><name>Social Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>8649</id><urlkey>personalgrowth</urlkey><name>Personal Growth</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>9874</id><urlkey>philanthropy</urlkey><name>Philanthropy</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10232</id><urlkey>women</urlkey><name>Women's Social</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10463</id><urlkey>rlhl</urlkey><name>Real-Life Healthy Life</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17866</id><urlkey>meeting-new-people</urlkey><name>Meeting New People</name></topics_item></topics><name>Women Supporting Women Through Life's Incredible Journeys</name><id>1379831</id><members>330</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>3507274</member_id><name>Mia</name></organizer><urlname>Women-Social-Network-Group</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/9/600_7285529.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/9/highres_7285529.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>7285529</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/9/thumb_7285529.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Ipswich</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Women-Social-Network-Group/</link><lon>-70.8499984741</lon></item>
