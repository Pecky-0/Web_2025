Today is your day! You're off to great places! You're off and away!", the immortal words of Dr. Suess. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Where do you go in your dreams? Places in dreams may have very significant meanings. A childhood home may represent your self. The basement of a house may represent your unconscious. An automobile driving down a roadway may be your journey through life. Flying up into the air may indicate soaring feelings of happiness. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We may visit other dimensions, planets, times, heavenly realms, forests, or tropical islands. Some people actually choose where they go in their dreams. Where would you choose to go to if you could visit a particular place in your dreams? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will explore the meanings of place in dreams as well as how to visit particular places. Bring your dreams to share if you choose to. All are welcome, whether you choose to share your dreams or not. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
