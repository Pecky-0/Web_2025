<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>From the boston.com website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wrestler &lt;br /&gt;Randy &amp;quot;The Ram&amp;quot; Robinson, a 1980s-era pro wrestler, has become a burnt-out shell of his former self. After he has a heart attack during a small-time match, a doctor tells him he could die if he fights again. In an effort to build a new life, Robinson takes a job at a deli, moves in with an aging stripper and tries to build a relationship with her son. But the prospect of a rematch with his old nemesis, the Ayatollah, proves too tempting to resist, even if it means risking his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nominated for two Oscars:  Best Actor - Mickey Rourke and Best Supporting Actress - Marisa Tomei&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a llink to a review by Roger Ebert:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080910/FILMFESTIVALS03/809109997/1034/FILMFESTIVALS" target="_blank"&gt;http://rogerebert.sun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we will head to a local restaurant for food, beverages, and conversation.  I think this film will provide interesting discussion possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the RSVP's are full and you wanted to attend, check back the week before as I will be changing the MAYBE's to NO's.  Also, if you are just coming to watch the movie and not going to the restaurant afterwards, you do NOT need to RSVP.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This theatre is just half a block from the Harvard Square T stop on the Red line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm short so if you can't see my sign with the commotion of people exiting the theatre, just come to the front of the theatre anyhow after the movie.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Susan will be holding a MEETUP sign near the front row after the movie</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>3369401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232930467000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Wrestler</name><id>9600168</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234052100000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9600168/</event_url></item>
