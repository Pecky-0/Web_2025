<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Randy Weston will be playing with the NEC Jazz Orchestra. I saw him about 20 years ago at the DeCordova; he knocked me out. He's getting old but he's probably still great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concert starts at 8, but I imagine that, being free, it will be well-attended so please try to get there early. I'll try to get there by 7:30 and hold a row of seats in the center orchestra section at about the seventh row, if I can. I'll bring a Meetup sign, so come in and try to find me in that vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;
