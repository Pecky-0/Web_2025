Though David is smitten, mysterious men conspire to keep him away from the beautiful dancer. David learns he is up against the powerful agents of Fate itself, and, glimpsing the future laid out before him, must either accept a predetermined path that does not include Elise, or defy Fate to be with her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THE USUAL STUFF: &lt;br /&gt;We'll meet right inside the theater ticket lobby doors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome, just be sure to include them in the RSVP so that I know who/how many to expect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP as up-to-date as possible. And please call me if you're going to be late or need to change your RSVP after I close RSVPs on the site (2 hours before we meet). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll head to a restaurant to chat about the movie (and just chat). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'll update the time a few days before the meetup, so keep an eye on your email! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you for there! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;--Michelle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie starts at 7:30, so we will meet by the ticket counter at 7 pm. Please be punctual and call if you can't make it after RSVPs close.&lt;/p&gt;
