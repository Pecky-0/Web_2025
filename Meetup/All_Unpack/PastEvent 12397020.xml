Join us for an entertaining and informational series! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooking not only destroys nutrition and enzymes, but chemically changes foods from the substances needed for health into free-radicals that could damage our health! During Raw Food Basics, you’ll find out what happens when you eat raw, whole foods rather than cooked or prepared foods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We support individuals in making life choices that promote health and well being in all aspects of their lives. If you desire a more healthful and conscious way of life, want more energy and vitality, want to learn about environmentally friendly cuisine, and the benefits of raw organic foods for your health and for the planet, Raw Food Basics workshops are right for you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three class series occurs on Thursday February 4, 11 &amp;amp; 18 from 7-9 pm with John &amp;amp; Imani @ The Alchemy Café.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$99 for all three classes!
