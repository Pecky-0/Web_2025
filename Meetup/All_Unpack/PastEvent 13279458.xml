So bring your kids, nieces, nephews, grandkids... whoever.. just bring them &lt;br /&gt;(big kids can sing too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's just as much fun for parents cuz it's gives them the opportunity to go out with their friends without getting a sitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food and drinks are reasonable priced. Full bar, draft beer, pizza, hot dogs, burgers, chicken fingers... and the food is pretty good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can make it. As you know I try to make these events kid freindly so we can have fun and share it with them... plus it's a pain to get a sitter all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rog out !&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the DJ - the Clubhouse is down the driveway beyond the Function Hall.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273881417000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272144057000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kid's Karaoke at the Clubhouse Wareham/Onset</name><id>13279458</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273867200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/13279458/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/4/global_14587220.jpeg</photo_url></item>
