Great groups to compete against and we don't want to boast, but we will, we have won many times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are recruiting fun members that want to help keep our winning streak going...There are prizes involved. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;We realize Monday Football may keep some away soon, but Gas Lamp has several large-screen plasma televisions ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a question for you: What's the most fun way to spend a Monday night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered &amp;quot;trivia&amp;quot;, you might just have what we're looking for.  If you answered &amp;quot;hanging out with the most awesome group EVER&amp;quot;, you can join us too.  If you answered &amp;quot;playing with a rubber duckie&amp;quot;, you may want to seek professional help (but come play trivia with us first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game consists of answering &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;AS A TEAM&lt;/span&gt; forty questions, spread out over four categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don't think you'll know many of the answers, you can still hang out with us and get to know some friendly people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be near the bar.
