After losing her boyfriend and her job in one fell swoop, Noreen finds it hard to know what the next step is—never mind take it. For the first time in a great many years, Noreen has time to herself. So she puts on a new pair of sneakers and a seriously outdated pair of exercise pants, and walks. &lt;br /&gt;It isn’t long before she’s joined by neighbors Tess and Rosie, two women as lost as she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the book and join us for a combination of Pot Luck BBQ and lively discussion about the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pot Luck BBQ&lt;br /&gt;Everyone Bring a Dish: Main Course for the grill, Salad, Side, or Dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 Women Choose a Main Course for the Grill: Chicken, Beef, Hot Dogs, Fish, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Women Choose Salad: Tossed, Potato, Macaroni, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 Women Choose Sides: Potatoes, Rice, Veggies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Women Choose Dessert! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Woman Choose paper goods (plates, cups, napkins, utensils)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT!!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PAY ATTENTION: WHEN YOU RESERVE PLEASE ADD A NOTE AS TO WHAT TYPE OF COURSE YOU ARE BRINGING AND WHAT IT IS SO IT WON'T BE REPEATED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF ALL THE MAIN COURSES ARE TAKEN, DO NOT PICK THIS, GO TO ANOTHER CATEGORY.
