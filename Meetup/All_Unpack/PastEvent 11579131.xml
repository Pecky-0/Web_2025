Suite Française tells the remarkable story of men and women thrown together in circumstances beyond their control. As Parisians flee the city, human folly surfaces in every imaginable way: a wealthy mother searches for sweets in a town without food; a couple is terrified at the thought of losing their jobs, even as their world begins to fall apart. Moving on to a provincial village now occupied by German soldiers, the locals must learn to coexist with the enemy—in their town, their homes, even in their hearts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;When Irène Némirovsky began working on Suite Française, she was already a highly successful writer living in Paris. But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz, where she died. For sixty-four years, this novel remained hidden and unknown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're at our wintering grounds, the Clear Conscience Cafe in Central Square.  If you don't see us surrounding a table or attempting to hoard the couches, and it's totally swamped, try the Au Bon Pain across Prospect and Mass Ave (684 Mass Ave).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1259885464000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254999678000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Readers: Suite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky</name><id>11579131</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259712000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/11579131/</event_url></item>
