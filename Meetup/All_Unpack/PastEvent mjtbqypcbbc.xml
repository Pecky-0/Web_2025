This is our third year with this event and they're a great way to spend an inexpensive evening in one of the most beautiful venues anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each flight night you get 3 or 4 glasses of wine paired with food.  The Somalier of the evening will explain the qualities of each glass and how the foods were chosen for the pairing.  A Flight Night may not make you a wine expert, but you're likely to learn a little something while having a great time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flight Nights are every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evening from 5:00pm - 7:00pm in Roosevelt's Lounge. Come join us for live jazz, featured flights of wine paired with complimentary hors d'ouevres and guest wine professionals. Reservations are not necessary and flights are usually three wines for $10-16.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob Lamothe</member_name><member_id>6364190</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295647046000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292875185000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flight Night at Wentworth by the Sea</name><id>mjtbqypcbbc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295564400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15886597/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/1/global_6980737.jpeg</photo_url></item>
