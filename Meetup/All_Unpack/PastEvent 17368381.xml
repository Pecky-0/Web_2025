Doane's is right off the road. It is a short but STEEP climb back up from the bottom set of falls but well worth it. I haven't been to Royalston Falls but the Trustee's website suggests that the trail is steep and probably pretty muddy. There are additional trails in the area around Tully Lake. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304395714000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Doane's Waterfalls are beautiful (see the photos on my profile) &amp; the locals tell me Royalston Falls are even better!
