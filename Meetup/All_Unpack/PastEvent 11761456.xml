My schedule has been hectic and it is time to have some fun....let's try Palmer's. Always a good crowd, &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; dance floor, and good food. Gather together around 7:30 to chat and have dinner or appetizers. The band playing this evening is called &lt;i&gt;Intrigue&lt;/i&gt;. Tables cannot be reserved here so we might be spread around the room but we can try to pull some together if we can get there by 7:30. Please RSVP if you are coming to eat. Ask for individual checks by table and please be sure to pay your food bill before the band starts so we do not have to track people down in the crowd. Looking forward to seeing our old friends and some new members!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258599467000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
