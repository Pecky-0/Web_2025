These kayak pool sessions will provide you an opportunity to practice or learn safety skills including wet exiting, self and assisted rescues, bracing and rolling techniques. This is a self paced &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;learn on your own&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; format practice session. Cost is $25 per person to come and practice based on a minimum of 12 people attending. If less then 12 people attend the cost will be slightly more. I do need to collect the money in advance to insure full attendance for each session. I'd also like to keep the number of people between 12 - 14 per session. If anyone wants to attend as a spotter and helper without your kayak you can do so free of charge. However if you want to participate in the session as well as bring your kayak you'll have to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will bring your own kayak, PFD, Paddle etc.. Please be sure your kayak is very clean inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to attend for practice please send a check for $25 made payable to me at my address below. I'll be sending out more info to those who sign-up.&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Neil Sheehan&lt;br /&gt;    763 Ocean Boulevard&lt;br /&gt;    Hampton, NH 03842&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: If your payment is not received at least one week prior to the event your RSVP will be removed unless you contact me in advance to make arrangements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please, do not forget, bring a very clean inside and out kayak to the pool!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in parking lot 15 minutes before session begins</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Neil Sheehan</member_name><member_id>7739813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272395575000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NE Seacoast Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastPaddlers</urlname><id>1238731</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268922607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Kayaking Safety, Bracing &amp; Rolling Skills at Portsmouth NH YMCA</name><id>12922471</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272222000000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastPaddlers/events/12922471/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/c/6/global_7263782.jpeg</photo_url></item>
