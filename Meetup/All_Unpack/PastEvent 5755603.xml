Well, it's not raining so I'm game to hike if you are. When we get there we can decide which trails we want to do (and break into groups if there are different preferences). I'll probably prefer a lower level trail that will be less muddy. Last time we broke into groups by how long people wanted to hike as well (my group went for a couple of hours, the other group went for longer). *******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Can't tell yet how the weather will be on Sunday...it depends on when the rain stops. If it is still raining Sunday morning, I'll probably reschedule the hike so check back here or give me a call.****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a few weeks so I am ready to hike Sleeping Giant again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping Giant has paths ranging from relatively easy to very difficult. I have had one request for a medium-level trail. We can decide at that day if we all want to do one path or if we want to break up into groups (if some want to do a tougher trail and some want to do an easier trail).  Feel free to post your preference in your RSVP. May go to lunch at a restaurant near Sleeping Giant after the hike if there is interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's too early to know what the weather will be like that day so check back when it gets closer. If it rains that day, I'll probably reschedule the hike for the next weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the Sleeping Giant parking lot at 11:00 am. There hasn?t been a charge to park yet but I don?t know if that will change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact is Andrea 203-641-8083&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179846512000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178641940000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday 5/20 -- Hike at Sleeping Giant</name><id>5755603</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179673200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5755603/</event_url></item>
