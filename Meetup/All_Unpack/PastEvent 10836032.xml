Natural fibers from animals, such as alpaca, angora, and merino, and plant fibers, chiefly cotton, have become easier and less costly to collect and process, and therefore more widely available. Exotic fibers, such as silk, bamboo, and qiviut, are growing in popularity as well.

Designers have begun to create patterns which work up quickly on large needles, a phenomenon known as instant-gratification knitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebrities including Julia Roberts, Winona Ryder, Dakota Fanning, Cameron Diaz and Russell Crowe have been seen knitting and have helped to popularize the revival of the craft.
