We'll meet and choose our sightseeing options, listen to some traditional Irish music, share a great Irish meal and meet all our fellow travelers. If you need a roommate ...we'll be doing that as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have a pint (or two) in the pub between 3 and 5 pm, while listening to some great music and discuss our travel options. At 5 pm we'll move into the restaurant to break bread...Irish style!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come join us at our pre-Ireland get together and join in the fun! I want to welcome each and every one of you and we will all get together to introduce ourselves to one another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have great news...I have been in touch with a Meetup group in Ireland and we are planning a meetup together. This is a meetup group based in Dublin with over 1200 members. Wow...we are gonna have a blast! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try to make it on this special day so we can reunite with old friends, or make new ones. NEXT STOP...DUBLIN!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Meetup sign on the table/ ask for Terri Bruno's table!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256247688000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253677937000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Irish Dinner, Music and Planning Strategy for My Irish Travelers!</name><id>11443971</id><headcount>32</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255892400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/11443971/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/4/c/global_10859964.jpeg</photo_url></item>
