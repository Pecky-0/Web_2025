The Myers-Briggs is a must - to understand people and it covers many bases the Enneagram doesn't touch. It's also the most widely known personality system in the world.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Herb always has great snacks. Great food, company and an interesting topic - an awesome way to spend a Friday night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** About Herb Pearce ****** &lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce, M.Ed., has been teaching personality systems for 20 years and has been a psychotherapist for 30 years, having worked with thousands of individuals, couples and families, as well as teams in corporations and agencies.
