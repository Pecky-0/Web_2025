What more is there to say? I love it and the Quincy China Pearl is a lot easier to find parking at than the China Pearl in Boston. Also, there aren't a lot of carts you have to flag down to get food anymore. Just order from the little paper menu they give you and the food comes out of the kitchen fast, fresh, and hot. They also have a buffet in the back in case you want to see all their food and order that way. The carts that do roam the restaurant are dessert carts, and pastry/appetizer carts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that we meet at 10am sharp because the place gets packed pretty quickly. The last time we went, we arrived at 10 and only waited 5 minutes. When we were done, the line of people waiting to get a seat wrapped around the building! Please RSVP no later than Saturday night so I can tell the hostess how many people will be in our party when I get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>B.F.
