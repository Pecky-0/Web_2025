The first thing that designers and &lt;br /&gt;merchandisers must learn to do very well, is evaluation – yet &lt;br /&gt;circumstances and individuality are continually different, making &lt;br /&gt;choices difficult. Let’s have some fun learning how each other &lt;br /&gt;evaluates fashion clothing designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First RSVP now, because  we are limited in attendees. Then start now &lt;br /&gt;looking around for photo clips from magazines or print off from &lt;br /&gt;Internet fashion sites to bring to the meetup. Each of you bring &lt;br /&gt;something in the following three categories:&lt;br /&gt;1. At least one photo of a fashion clothing design you really love.  If &lt;br /&gt;you have more than one then choose which is number one.&lt;br /&gt;2. At least one photo of a fashion clothing design you hate. Again, if &lt;br /&gt;you have more than one then choose which is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;3. A few photos that demonstrate what you believe will be successful &lt;br /&gt;trends. Right now top designers are showing Fall 2010 and stores are &lt;br /&gt;showing Spring 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to a fun and productive learning time, Wednesday,  &lt;br /&gt;March 17, 6 PM at Starbucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley Willett</member_name><member_id>1480973</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan</member_name><member_id>2523024</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270593876000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>fashionandmusic</urlname><id>1390310</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Fashion and Music Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267455691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beginners in Clothing Design &amp; Fashion Merchandising</name><id>12742985</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268863200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fashionandmusic/events/12742985/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/1/6/global_12633862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
