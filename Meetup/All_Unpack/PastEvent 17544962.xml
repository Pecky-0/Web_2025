We will be practicing on stage and hopefully at the end of the day&amp;nbsp;go out and practice what we have learned!
There will be more to come! We will be joined by other meetup groups!
We will be having a potlluck dinner so bring something to share.

&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure what a flashmob is then now is the time to learn. It's a cultural trend spreading via the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this video of a flashmob done in Grand Central...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwMj3PJDxuo" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwMj3PJDxuo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flash mob is a large group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual action for a brief time, then quickly disperse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flashmobs are a fun way to take your humor, social, and theatrical skills and put them to the test, and a great way to make friends too! Join and come to one of our meetings, or simply contact any of the organizers for information.&lt;/p&gt;
