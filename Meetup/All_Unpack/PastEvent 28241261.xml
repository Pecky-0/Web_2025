&lt;p&gt;Overview:&amp;nbsp; In one of Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s most iconic films, the Torrance family - Jack (Jack Nicholson), Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and Danny (Danny Lloyd) - become haunted by an evil menace while isolated for the winter season in the glorious Overlook Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanley Kubrick co-adapted this script from the Stephen King novel, and turned the story of Torrance family into one of the most chilling and masterful horror films of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubrick melds vivid performances, menacing settings, dreamlike tracking shots, and shock after shock into a milestone of the macabre. As the ghostly inhabitants of the Overlook slowly drive Jack insane, his wife and son may have a much more tangible threat to worry about...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a one night only showing and I strongly advise you to buy your tickets in advance.&amp;nbsp; Please indicate in your rsvp when you have purchased your ticket.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we will gather outside the theater and anyone interested for dinner and drinks, we will go to Zaftig's Deli, which is right nearby.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They have lots of traditional Jewish Deli Fare and also sell beer and wine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
