The beta has been released and we've been using it for just over a week so we'll give a quick update, reactions and answer some questions before you decide to install it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second comes from James Mitchell:  &amp;quot;Many people are now realizing that WP is great for designing traditional Web sites in addition to a blog. A session that simply started from scratch and showed everything that pertained to making your site look like a web site rather than a blog would be useful.&amp;quot;  We will have a roundtable discussion on what makes a WordPress site look like a website instead of a blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have 2 questions for those attending when you RSVP:  Are you a designer/theme developer?  And would you be willing to participate in answering questions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much and we hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>James Coletti</member_name><member_id>7809368</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kurt Eng</member_name><member_id>9694496</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274743847000</updated><rating><average>4.26999998093</average><count>22</count></rating><group><who>WordPress fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-wordpress-meetup</urlname><id>1340213</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston WordPress</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>117</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270811747000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BWPM April 2010: WordPress 3.0 &amp; How to Set up a Website and not a Blog</name><id>13133142</id><headcount>117</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272322800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-wordpress-meetup/events/13133142/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/2/3/global_12023923.jpeg</photo_url></item>
