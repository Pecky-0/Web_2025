Impressed by what he saw, Davis asked Holland to move to New York and join his band. Holland spent the next two years touring with Davis, and also contributing to the classic Davis albums In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew. After a tenure with Davis, Holland left the group and, together with Chick Corea, Anthony Braxton, and Barry Altschul, formed the group Circle. Holland continued to work with many notables in the jazz field during the 1970s, including Theolonius Monk, Stan Getz, and Sam Rivers. In the 1980s, Holland was part of several jazz combos, including a quintet featuring Steve Coleman, an artist in residence at NEC in October 2004, as well as taking on full time faculty duties right here at the Conservatory which later awarded him an honorary degree. Today, Holland continues to tour with jazz legends such as Herbie Hancock and Pat Metheny, and also perform, on Grammy-nominated albums such as Joe Henderson's So Near, So Far and Jack DeJohnette's Parallel Realities Question and Answer. His latest incarnation, The Dave Holland Quintet, recorded the album Points of View for ECM in 1998. Holland was named an NEC Visiting Artist-in-Residence last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During week-long residencies this fall and spring, Holland will work privately with NEC students in coachings and rehearsals, and will offer public workshops and a concert of his music with NEC students. Tonight, Holland will perform alongside tenor sax great &lt;a href="http://www.chrispotter.com" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Potter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm. We will meet in the lobby at 7:30pm and then get seats around 7:45pm. Please RSVP so we know you are coming. I'm the blonde guy with the black tenor sax gig bag slung over his shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert is FREE. &lt;a href="http://concerts.newenglandconservatory.edu/index.php?Date_Year=2007&amp;amp;Date_Month=04&amp;amp;Date_Day=09" target="_blank"&gt;More info about the concert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176334654000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Jazz Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonjazz</urlname><id>87187</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Jazz Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175044142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Jazz April Meetup - Dave Holland and Chris Potter</name><id>5611617</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176161400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonjazz/events/5611617/</event_url></item>
