Don't know how to play? We only use the very basic rules and have a good time getting some exercise out of doors.  We usually play for around 2 hours, so plenty of time to get to your favorite football viewing spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone can bring a frisbee, that'd be great.  If fewer than 6 sign up, I will cancel.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be by the statue at the north end of the park.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291037415000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290700662000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ultimate Frisbee @ Armory Park (work off those calories!)</name><id>15554702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290959100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/15554702/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
