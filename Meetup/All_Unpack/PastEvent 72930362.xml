This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and event scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Camille's - in Historic Federal Hill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camille's on Federal Hill is a classic. Renowned for its location (make a left under the pineapple arch on Atwells Ave.) and fabulous Italian cuisine, its a Federal Hill icon. The main dining room is pretty formal, but there is also a lovely patio terrace called the Roman Garden in the back that offers beautiful al fresco dining in a casual, relaxed atmosphere. The Roman Garden also has a large lounge area for mingling and chatting the evening away, but we wouldn't know anything about that, would we.....?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one got rained out a few weeks ago, so we're going to try again and they will be making a few pizzas for us to sample as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the Gallery section and select Lounge/Patio at the lower left to see pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you haven't been, where better to spend a warm summer evening than in the Roman Garden patio at Camille's socializing with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is worth knowing about, so let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there! Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a bright blue, gradated-dyed scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
