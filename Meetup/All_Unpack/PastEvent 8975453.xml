Feel free to invite as many friends/family as you'd like! (The picture here is from last year's event!)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's basically one outdoor party in the orchard. Picnic tables go fast, so bring beach chairs or blankets (we usually try to secure a few tables). It's family-friendly so feel free to bring your kids. Dogs are allowed but must be on a leash. You can take a 30-minute tour of the winemaking facility for $6 (includes souvenir wine glass). There may or may not be apple picking depending on how the weather is the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They have a food tent set up that sells burgers, dogs, Italian sausage, pulled pork, brisket. Side dishes like cole slaw, potato salad, cornbread, and apple crisp. I recommend that you eat before 3:00 as they tend to run out of food early...You can also bring your own picnic baskets and coolers!!! They have a caramel apple stand too.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their microbrews will be for sale on tap at the outdoor bar and they will also be selling wine/beer by the bottle inside the wineshop all day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nashoba Winery &amp;amp; Orchard&lt;br /&gt;100 Wattaquadock Hill Road&lt;br /&gt;Bolton, MA 01740&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nashobawinery.com" target="_blank"&gt;Nasoba Winery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Located conveniently off I-495 at Exit 27 (Route 117).
