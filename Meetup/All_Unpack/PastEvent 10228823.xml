(Maria) 3 groups will be joining in for this meet-up. Bring a dog if you have one or just want to hang out and play and have some icecream that's okay too. Bring your camera to take pictures! Pack a lunch too if you want. We will meet at the icecream stand at 11:00. Off of 146 take Purgatory Chasm exit and take a left and the stand will be up on the right. Hope for a nice day and hopefully see some of you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the icecream stand 11:00</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 6874991</member_name><member_id>6874991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241449992000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gay Women Over 40</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>lgbtfriends-212</urlname><id>1155810</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>WEST OF BOSTON OVER 40 GAY WOMENS MEET-UP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240263560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Women-Dogs-Icecream-Photography</name><id>10228823</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241276400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lgbtfriends-212/events/10228823/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/0/global_4210720.jpeg</photo_url></item>
