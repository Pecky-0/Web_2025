Latin Night at the Iron Horse hosted by DJ Joey provides a nice club and party atmosphere.  It starts at ten and what you usually find is the avid salsa dancers come out first. This crowd is really diverse, easy going and down to earth. This is where you will be able to practice those Salsa moves you just learned or display the hot moves you already have down in a judgement free zone.  The music for the first hour or two is purely Salsa, Merengue, and Bachata.  As the night goes on you will see a transition in the party crowd, Joey begins to play more freestyle club music, such as reggaeton, and latin hip hop.  A young and upbeat crowd from the surrounding colleges and communities starts to gather towards the end of the evening.  Whatever your pleasure, Salsa or freestyle, this is the place to dance to Latin music.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201230351000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200187151000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salsa Dancing</name><id>7100221</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201057200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/7100221/</event_url></item>
