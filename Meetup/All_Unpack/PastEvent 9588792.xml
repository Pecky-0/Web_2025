<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a sequel to the Halldorson Redneck Bonfire...we hope to have even more people come. We've got the burning stuff down to a bit of a science now. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will still be BYOB but we'll have soda, chips etc for the kiddos and would like to have hot coffee &amp;amp; hot chocolate to help keep everyone warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we'll be more settled in there should be more room for people to go inside to warm up if needed. And we'll make a big effort to have the pond lit up and available for skating...so this time absolutely bring those skates! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else has some advice for improving on the last bonfire...feel free to share. Hope everyone can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOO HOO...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Times are tough, which makes it the perfect time to get out of the house and laugh good and loud with friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids &amp;amp; Pups are welcome...and bring your friends too. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Halldorsons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details can be found over at the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=45092374050&amp;amp;ref=mf" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234221115000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232757817000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>*Bigger* Halldorson Redneck Bonfire</name><id>9588792</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234047600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9588792/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
