The first hour is a potluck lunch and a chance to get to know members.  The second hour is the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup fee:  $10&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Micki Kuttler, LMT, Professional Bowenwork(R) Practitioner, provides Bowen Therapy to adults and children in the Boston area. Bowen Therapy is a gentle healing modality that was developed by Tom Bowen in Australia in the second half of the 20th century. It involves a unique stretch and roll move precisely located at specific points on the body.  These moves activate the body's natural healing response without triggering any defensive reactions. The work is relaxing, safe for people of all ages from newborns to the very old, fit or unfit, and can complement medical treatment. It is very effective in treating both acute injuries (sprains, strains), and chronic conditions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bowen Therapy is helpful in resolving a wide range of health concerns, from sports injuries and other musculo-skeletal pains, restrictions and imbalances, to hormonal imbalances, digestive disorders, headaches and migraines, fibromyalgia, and even infertility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Micki Kuttler is the founder of Boston Bowen. She is a Licensed Massage Therapist, and a Professional Bowenwork Practitioner certified by the Bowen Therapy Academy of Australia. She has been practicing massage since 1998 and Bowen since 2003 and is currently accepting new clients into her Cambridge-based practice. She enjoys helping people feel better, and loves the way people respond to Bowen work. She believes, as did Tom Bowen, that &amp;quot;Every body is better with Bowen.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will welcome them at the door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297446424000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279801240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup:  Bowen Therapy</name><id>14178748</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297441800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/14178748/</event_url></item>
