You would have electrical lights, but without sunlight it would begin to get depressing. A house without windows and doors becomes more like a dungeon than a healthy living space. In the same way we are called to serve others, not through our faith, but through our service by means of our faith. This service allows our light to shine. Using our gifts to serve others in love as an outward expression of inward connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 We can profess our faith to others, recite spells and prayers, show up to circle, but our faith, our heart and our inward light will only shine when we set aside ourselves by serving others. Our service is the true window to our soul and one of the best testimonies of the world we wish to create.&lt;/p&gt;
