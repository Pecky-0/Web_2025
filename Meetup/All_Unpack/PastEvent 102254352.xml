&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another meetup! Message me to reserve a spot. Â If you don't make it on the roster, I will put you on the waiting list. &lt;span&gt;If you can't make it, please change your RSVP on the meetup site as early as possible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And let me know if you are running late.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Those who cancel last minute, don't show up, or consistently come late will not be admitted to future meetups. If you are not on the roster, please don't come expecting to play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is for Yankee C- and above level only. Players are required to know how to play a 6-2 and 5-1 formations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is free if you are a member of Boston Community Centers. If not, it's a one-time $20 membership fee that is good for a year (they don't accept cash). When you come in, pick up an application at the front desk and pay them (not me). Those who paid at the Orient Heights Community Center can use their cards at this gym too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is non-residential street parking by the gym and a parking lot. Once you are on Medford St, take your first right and the lot is on your right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also 5 minute walk from the Sullivan T stop and Bunker Hill College stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
