The mind seems to have a life of its own, with random thoughts, worries and fears that can be overwhelming.  Since who we are and what we become depends on what we think, it is essential to master the mind.  Through concentration and meditation you can come to know the peace that emerges from a quiet mind attuned to the One Mind of God.  From this place, you can create exactly the life you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday May 19th&lt;br /&gt;With Rev.
