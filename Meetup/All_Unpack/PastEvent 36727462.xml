My name is Clara Luo and I&amp;#146;m a member of the BU Entrepreneurship Club. The club, along with some faculty members and alumni, is organizing an event called Start-Up Weekend focusing on creative industries and technology. The event is being held on BU campus from October 14-16th and it could be an amazing opportunity for everyone in the Boston area. The participants come on Friday evening and are given the choice to either pitch a business idea or vote on their favorite. Participants will then break off into teams based on the best 10-12 ideas. The teams spend the rest of the weekend developing the business concept, creating a minimally viable product, and finally pitch their business concepts to a panel of judges. The event is open to people of all ages and academic backgrounds! Please let me know if you can help in any way to reach out and spread the word! &lt;a href="http://boston.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston.startup...&lt;/a&gt; Kindest Regards, Clara Luo Boston University School of Management '12 (908) 392-5518 | claraluo@bu.edu&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318637406000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Java Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-java</urlname><id>87071</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Java Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318177104000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Start Up Weekend</name><id>36727462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318633200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-java/events/36727462/</event_url></item>
