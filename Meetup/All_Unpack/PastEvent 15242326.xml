Twisted is an event-driven network engine in Python, with a large rich set of components.  Start with a fully functioning web server, mash it up with DNS, bridge over to chat, and throw in a little SMTP.  Whatever you need in your networked code, Twisted has the parts to build it.  They're all built on a uniform core, and can all be programmed together with Python, making Twisted's toolbox the richest and most powerful way to create networked software.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tonight's format is slightly different: we'll start with a presentation about Twisted and how it works, then switch into active mode with a directed lab.  Bring your laptops and build real code!  If you don't have the equipment (or the desire) to do the lab yourself, come anyway, and pair up with someone who does.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Glyph Lefkowitz and J.P. Calderone are the two brightest stars in the Twisted firmament: Glyph founded and continues to lead Twisted, and J.P. is its most prolific contributor.  Who better than them to explain Twisted and initiate us into its mysteries?  It should be a really interesting evening!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll send instructions later for installing the lab prerequisites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Microsoft NERD center&lt;br /&gt;Time: 6:30 for chatting, presentation at 7:00.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ned Batchelder</member_name><member_id>1824278</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292375700000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>18</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>82</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288145346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intro to Twisted: presentation and LAB</name><id>15242326</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290038400000</time><rsvp_limit>100</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/15242326/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/8/4/global_13742692.jpeg</photo_url></item>
