Pack a snack and spend an hour. Exxcel is jam-packed with exciting toys, props, games, and activities for your little ones to enjoy in this non-structured “open play”. You and your child will participate in innovative, fun-filled obstacle courses that teach the basic gymnastics elements - swinging, climbing, running, jumping, and other motor development activities. Parents work with their children on basic motor development in this movement class that emphasizes exploration. Trampolines and our giant foam pit enhance your toddler's coordination and enjoyment. You and your child will have a ball spending quality time together at gymnastics class!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This playdate will be 1 hr long. Feel free to have a snack after in one of our party rooms as long as you clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$8/child &lt;br /&gt;$12/family &lt;br /&gt;$5/child currently enrolled in a class at Exxcel &lt;br /&gt;$10/family currently enrolled in a class at Exxcel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spaces are limited RSVP soon!
