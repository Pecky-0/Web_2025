(More information on meeting time and campsite coming, Paula has already reserved one). There are some great sights to see in this south western corner of Massachusetts including Bish Bash and Race Brook falls, two of the best waterfalls in New England. We'll hike Mt Everett on Monday which gives us a great view of the surrounding area and anyone who does not want to camp can join us Monday morning for the hike....but it is a 3 hour drive from Newport.  If you don't have camping gear some of us probably have extra so dont hesitate to ask. Price is 10 bucks per person for the campground. Email me for more details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, we have our campground, check it out, it looks great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=137" target="_blank"&gt;http://nysparks.state...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have swimming and bike trails there so bring your suit and/or bike if you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail information for the Monday hike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlights: waterfalls, great views, blueberries&lt;br /&gt;Near: Sheffield, MA  &lt;br /&gt;Scenery: ****&lt;br /&gt;Distance: 7 miles round trip&lt;br /&gt;Elevation Gain: 2400 ft&lt;br /&gt;Hike Time: 4.5 hours&lt;br /&gt;Difficulty: Moderate&lt;br /&gt;Trail Condition: Well maintained trail&lt;br /&gt;HikeType: Out and Back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: This hike will take to two peaks along the Appalachian Trail in the Berkshire mountains of Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;From the parking area follow the Race Brook Trail which is marked with blue blazes. There are many cascades and waterfalls along the way.&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 miles, you reach the Appalachian Trail which is blazed with white paint. Turning South leads to Mount Race. There is 360 degree view at the top. To the west you can see Alander mountain and beyond that - the Catskills.&lt;br /&gt;To the North, you can see Mount Everett - your next destination on the AT trail. Along the ridge, you will see a lot of mountain laurel which blooms in mid-June. There is also a proliferation of blueberries (huckleberries) near the summits of these mountains.&lt;br /&gt;The tower is gone from Mount Everett, but the views are nice nonetheless - especially to the South back towards Mount Race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead: Take Taconic State Parkway to NY Route 23. Follow Route 23 East through Hillsdale and into Massachusetts. Turn South onto MA Route 41. The trailhead is located on the right in 5.1 miles.&lt;br /&gt;(Lat:42.089 Lon:-73.411)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>call my cell 508-414-8544</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253369628000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251329275000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Camping/Hiking at Mt Everett State Park</name><id>11210323</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252263600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/11210323/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/8/global_10405816.jpeg</photo_url></item>
