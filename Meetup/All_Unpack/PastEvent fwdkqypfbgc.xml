Prizes include wine and a pair of Red Sox Yankees tickets for a Saturday afternoon&amp;nbsp;game. Drawing to take place around 8pm. We will be staying for Trivia too!***&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Let's go back for the newest game in town at Bleacher Bar, Trivia + Bingo = Trivingo. ' Two classic games combined to form an exciting, nonstop, group game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff, is an awesome game host because he keeps the game moving and entertaining while DJ Frank drops great interlude jams. Ryan, the Bleacher Bar manager has been so accommodating and Joe has got to be the BEST bartender bar none (pun very intended). He's saved our seats at the bar with glasses of water waiting for us and is always so very welcoming,&amp;nbsp;attentive and pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month our teams, have proven to be the smahtest in the room. We've won Sox Monster tickets, Bruins tickets and Bleacher Bar tshirts as well as $50 and $10 gift cards.&amp;nbsp;Let's bring more teams so we can win more prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
