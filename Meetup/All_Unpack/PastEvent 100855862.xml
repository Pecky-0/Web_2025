Anybody interested in going? — in Portsmouth, NH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More info: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Tickets:  I have 1 extra free ticket that has already been claimed. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

However, according to the website, tickets are only .$5.00. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

You can order these online at :   &lt;a href="http://www.portsmouthgaslight.com/third_landing.cfm" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.portsmouthgaslight.com/third_landing.cfm&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Show starts at 7:00, doors open at 6:00. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I plan on getting there for 6:30. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I'll have a MEETUP sign on the table. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We can go out for drinks after the show if anyone is interested. There are several nice pubs close by..or at the Gas Light itself. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Call me on my cell  (603 494-6543) or email me from the meetup site with questions. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

There are TWO comedians performing. Here is a writeup: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Comedy Night - January 25th &lt;br /&gt;

Headliner Steve Scarfo - His high energy, real life approach to material coupled with his sometimes bizarre viewpoint is sure to strike a chord in any audience and keep them in stitches! &lt;br /&gt;

Brian Brinegar - Brian has worked as a stand-u comic in venues all across &lt;br /&gt;

New England including opening for Comedy Central’s Todd Barry. He focuses on audience involvement and is sure to get everyone laughing. A guaranteed good show. Doors open at 6pm and the show starts at 7. Special dinner menu available upon request &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The snow storm that was predicted is now not going happen, so driving should be ok. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;
