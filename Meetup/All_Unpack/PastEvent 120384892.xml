&lt;p&gt;Meet at parking lot at Stonehurst/Paine Estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 mile option:  run the Greenway up to Trapelo road and return to Stonehurst on the same path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 mile option:  run the Greenway to the Metropolitan Parkway North on the Lexington border, then R on the parkway, continue onto Forest, R on Beaver to return to Stonehurst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.5 mile option: Greenway to R on Mill street, then down through Beaver Brook N and S, L on Waverley oaks to R on Beaver, R to cut thru Cedar Hill trails then L on Forest to R on Beaver and R into Stonehurst. We'll be getting into dusk but as long as we keep pace we shouldn't need flashlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF YOU INDICATE IN YOUR RSVP BY SATURDAY MORNING THAT YOU ARE GOING I WILL CACHE WATER FOR YOU ON THE ROUTE.  Please tell me your distance as this will affect quantities at each cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you opt for the long route and have done it with me before, note that I've added some trail sections through Beaver Brook N that parallel Mill street, so now we have even more trail and less street sections, and they are great trails with some spillways (hey, urban waterfalls, they're lovely!).  So it will be even better than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if you've run this in the past, give yourself more credit; I figured out my GPS is just not capturing the trail distances accurately; I had the pleasure to run the course with some experienced runners who were able to help me generate better distance estimates based on our pace and time; I've adjusted the reported distances accordingly.  I always thought the "9 miler" took forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
