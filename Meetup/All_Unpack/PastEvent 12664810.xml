The children “relive” the exodus from Egypt as they pound out their very own Matzah. Beginning with a sheave of wheat, they experience the hustle and bustle as they hurry to beat the timer to ensure that crunchy finished product is completed within 18 minutes! The delightful presentation creates an exciting interactive environment where the children have a great time learning about their heritage and the tradition of Matzah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lively and educational exhibit is fun for all ages, and all participants take home their very own Matzah, plus real hand-made Matzah made from Israel! Also each child will creat their very own Afikomen bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children of all ages are invited to experience the incredible Model Matzah Bakery. From threshing and winnowing the wheat stalks, to kneading and rolling, each child will bake their own Matzah, from scratch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 dollars per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP to raizel@jewishpeabody.com 978-977-9111 or www.jewishpeabody.com &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raizel</member_name><member_id>4697687</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269371127000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Jewish parents or caregivers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mommy-and-me-with-a-jewish-twist-north-shore</urlname><id>1493750</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>mommy and me with a Jewish twist</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266780977000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Model  Matzah Bakery</name><id>12664810</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269198000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mommy-and-me-with-a-jewish-twist-north-shore/events/12664810/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/d/global_13236957.jpeg</photo_url></item>
