Dues help to pay the cost of speakers and other programming, and they allow us to do outreach and other activities. Please show your support for Humanism and GWH. You can pay dues at the GWH web site: www.worcesterhumanists.org or you can see our treasurer, Don Guyton, at the next meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269363895000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265551286000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting: "The Current State of Women's Reproductive Rights in the US"</name><id>12542256</id><headcount>42</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268177400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/12542256/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/2/global_7423922.jpeg</photo_url></item>
