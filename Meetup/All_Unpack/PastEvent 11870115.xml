<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;What&lt;/b&gt;: A casual hike &amp;amp; ramble around Purgatory Chasm MA (about 45' south of Worcester towards Providence on Rt 146)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When&lt;/b&gt;: THIS SUNDAY 11/15 @ 11:00 AM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why&lt;/b&gt;: I lost a lens cap there &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rain and wind are coming all day Saturday. Sooooooo let's gather Sunday late morning for a ramble around Purgatory Chasm. I have only been there once, and am looking forward to going back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meet place will be the parking lot on the left that is less than 5 minutes from Rt 146.  &lt;br /&gt;Sturdy shoes are a must for this place. There are plenty of easy paths, as well as more &amp;quot;adventurous&amp;quot; routes for those so inclined.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm in a blue Ford Explorer with MA &amp;quot;Birthplace of Basketball&amp;quot; Tags. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not checked out food options in the area - but there is always something if people want to get a bite after we are done at the Chasm. You may want to bring something with you - perhaps water and a snack - for the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to self: must find out why it is called &amp;quot;Purgatory&amp;quot; Chasm on this visit. &lt;br /&gt;So who's up for a ramble? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpe Carp - Seize the Fish &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258474155000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258160029000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Casual Hike and Ramble at Purgatory Chasm</name><id>11870115</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258300800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/11870115/</event_url></item>
