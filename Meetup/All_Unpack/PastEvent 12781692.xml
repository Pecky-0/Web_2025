We will be having two speakers, the first presentation will be from Green Power Management and the second presentation will be from the former city Mayor.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. Peter &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A little more about the &amp;quot;Green Drinks&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every month people who work in the environmental field meet up at informal sessions known as Green Drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a lively mixture of people from NGOs, academia, government and business. Come along and you'll be made welcome. Just say, &amp;quot;are you green?&amp;quot; and we will look after you and introduce you to whoever is there. It's a great way of catching up with people you know and also for making new contacts. Everyone invites someone else along, so thereâ€™s always a different crowd, making Green Drinks an organic, self-organising network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These events are very simple and unstructured, but many people have found employment, made friends, developed new ideas, done deals and had moments of serendipity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
