Academy Award-winner George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a businessman on the verge of reaching five million frequent flyer miles when his company decides to cut back on travel. But his goal isn't the only thing just out of reach: he now won't be able to see a fellow frequent traveler (THE DEPARTED's Vera Farmiga) who has caught his eye.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m-Da8Tz4_E" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Up in the Air trailer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meetup details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Time&lt;/u&gt;:  The movie starts at 7 so I've set the meeting time to 6:45 as the Kendall gets rather lively on w/end nights.  (If you're late and miss the group before the movie starts, it should be easy to find the group afterwards.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Finding the group&lt;/u&gt;:  Entering the theater, there's a staircase on the right. I'll be waiting on the 2nd floor landing at the top of those stairs in plain view of the entrance (and out of the mob scene on the 1st floor) by 6:30. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have Meetup, uh, stuff but in deference to the colors I'll wear a red and white checkered shirt and black pants, and you'll be able to reach me @ 617-852-9428 until the movie's start time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the movie&lt;/u&gt;:  During the credits let's gather toward the front of the theater as people file out. For those who'd like to eat/drink/discuss afterwards, we can then head over to The Friendly Toast.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See Meetup details below.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave M.</member_name><member_id>7526742</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264954075000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260220463000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Up in the Air @ Kendall Square</name><id>12038279</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260661500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/12038279/</event_url></item>
