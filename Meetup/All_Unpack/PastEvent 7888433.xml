We need to promote vigorous opposition to the war on all levels -- from local demonstrations such as this to the large regional and national demonstrations we have helped organize in the past, and expect to work on in the future as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us in Copley Square, starting at 5 pm, going until the end. We will stand out with signs and banners for traffic, and engage passersby to keep the war in Iraq an issue, and agitation against it alive.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll make it easier for you this time.  Banners, flags and posters will be very visible, and if that still doesn't work, give me a call at 248/303-3785.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Schaich</member_name><member_id>4406518</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211145054000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialists</urlname><id>519668</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Socialist Party USA -- Boston Branch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210125034000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stand Out Against the Wars</name><id>7888433</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210971600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialists/events/7888433/</event_url></item>
