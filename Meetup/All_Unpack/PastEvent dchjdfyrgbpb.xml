&lt;p&gt;NOTICE:  RSVP DEADLINE IS MAY 6, so don't delay if you plan to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that any other member of this Meetup group can also create and host a Meetup event at any other location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, whenever video capability is not required, we can meet at our usual place, which is the Celery Stick Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_____________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetups at the Celery Stick cafe are informal discussions about the topic announced, as attendees sit and eat.   All members are invited to bring books and other references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Celery Stick Cafe has expectation that those sitting and taking up table space will first purchase something to eat there.  They have great soups, salads, and assorted hot meals. Also a wide variety of delicious desserts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to monthly meetings at the Celery Stick Cafe (Concord Cooperative Market) on the 2nd Thursday of each month, any member can use this site to announce additional Meetups they wish to host at other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993300 ; font-size : medium"&gt;So if you would like to host a Meetup, then go right ahead!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you would like to become a co-organizer, please let the organizer know.  To do that, either phone 603-286-8191 , or send an e-mail to &lt;a href="mailto:info@ulcsclinic.com"&gt;info@ulcsclinic.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Please enter "Meetup Member" in subj. line so your message won't get deleted unread due to spam controls.  Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go up 1st driveway (NOT 2nd one, which has ULCS Clinic sign.)
