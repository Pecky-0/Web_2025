The libretto uses the original Shakespeare dialogue and it's very funny. The opera is about the adventures of four young lovers in a love quadrangle and a group of six amateur actors who are controlled and manipulated by the King and Queen of fairies who inhabit the forest. At one point, the fairy King punishes the fairy Queen by making her fall in love with a donkey. Here are the performance dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, March 29 @ 8:30 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;

 Saturday, March 30 @ 8:30 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;

 Wednesday, April 3 @ 8:30 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;

 Friday, April 5 @ 8:30 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;

 Saturday, April 6 @ 8:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
