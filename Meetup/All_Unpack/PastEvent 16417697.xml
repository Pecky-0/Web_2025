&lt;p&gt;If you have had enough of winter and are ready for another great&amp;nbsp;Wine Tasting from Boston Uncorked purchase your tickets now. Last months event was cancelled due to weather conditions so this one should fill up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event will takee from 7:00 - 9:00 PM at Morton's Steak House at 699 Boylston Street in the Back Bay. Members from my Red Sox Natives and Cathy's Boston Wine groups will also be joining us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Uncorked invites you to join&amp;nbsp;them for Winter Warm-Up 3 as it is just the right recipe to enjoy copious wines and hors d'oeuvres, be warm and cozy with great people in this warm and cozy atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a glass, grab a plate, grab a couch and grab some gab with equally warm people. There is no better way to stay warm on this Wednesday night in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are $39.00 per person. There are no Maybe RSVPs since you must purchase a ticket in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
