It is open seating, so bring a towel or blanket to sit on if you can. I can probably bring a blanket to share with a few people. They are also renting chairs for $10 - you'll get back $3 when you return the chair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring a picnic dinner. You could also pick something up after you arrive since there are plenty of shops and cafes in the area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll send out my cell number Sunday afternoon to those that RSVP, so we can find each other once the Common starts filling up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info about the Shakespeare on the Common and the play Othello:  &lt;a href="http://www.commshakes.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.commshakes...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case of rain, they will cancel and we'll either postpone to another date or give up, because rescheduling twice isn't always fun.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send my cell number closer on since once it starts to fill up, it may be hard to find each other. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>3324571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281310027000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281042736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Shakespeare's Othello on Boston Common</name><id>14332670</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281305700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/14332670/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
