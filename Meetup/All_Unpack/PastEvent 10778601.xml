<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the last big undeveloped land along the Connecticut coast.  It was designated as a Costal Reserve to preserve and protect the wildlife and scenic features in an undisturbed state.  There is a beach, views of the sound, and the foundation of a house that once belonged to Governor Winthrop.  Bring a picnic lunch, and we will eat when we get back from our walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 3 miles with some easy up hills.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 hours.  Rain cancels.  Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  100 Depot Rd, Groton, CT.  Go under the railroad underpass, and follow the road to the end.  We will meet in the picnic area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=100+depot+rd,+groton,ct&amp;amp;sll=41.333933,-72.033834&amp;amp;sspn=0.010634,0.034161&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.339797,-72.033706&amp;amp;spn=0.010633,0.017896&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249772596000</updated><rating><average>4.44999980927</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246460172000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bluff Point Walk, Groton, CT</name><id>10778601</id><headcount>34</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249137000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/10778601/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
