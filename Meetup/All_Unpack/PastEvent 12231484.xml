This is THE secret to manifesting all that you desire, and to FEELING GOOD! (lol- I just made a typo, typing in feeling &amp;quot;god&amp;quot;.  Same thing, I guess!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This month we'll be focusing on expanding love - for yourself and, if you choose, to send it to those who could use this extra positive energy.  The world is feeling a lot of sorrow and despair over Haiti these days.  I invite you  to join me in creating and sending some positive, healing energy instead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We invite you to come to nurture yourself and to fully relax into serenity and bliss.  All you’ll have to do is listen to my voice as I lead you through the process, like listening to a good story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome!  The class is appropriate whether you are a beginner to meditating, or experienced.  And, please invite others to sign up and join you; and forward this to your friends, families and groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Ann's guided meditations are a rare opportunity for me to intentionally dream.  The hour or so of deliberate peace and good feelings have become a treasured respite for me.  With Ann's assistance, I find myself able to relax and focus on my mind, body, spirit and thoughts.  I leave there renewed and inspired every time!&amp;quot; Charlene Frary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you RSVP, &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt; let us know if your plans change, so we won’t be waiting for you unnecessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** If you prefer to meditate lying down, please bring whatever you might need to be comfortable: mat, pillow, blanket, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm heart,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264984111000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262722617000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE Evening of Guided Meditations</name><id>12231484</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264810500000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/12231484/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/4/global_5412564.jpeg</photo_url></item>
