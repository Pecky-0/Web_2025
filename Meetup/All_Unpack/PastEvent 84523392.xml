I couldn't make the meetup last weekend, but given the positive reviews -- and likely big crowds -- maybe there are others who missed it as well. Also, maybe there are some who want a second viewing, giving how complex P.T. Anderson films can be. (Or, if you only want to join the post-film discussion, that's fine too; just indicate it in your RSVP.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A striking portrait of drifters and seekers in post-World War II America, &lt;em&gt;The Master&lt;/em&gt; unfolds the journey of a Navy veteran (Joaquin Phoenix) who arrives home from war unsettled and uncertain of his future—until he is tantalized by The Cause and its charismatic leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson &lt;em&gt;(There Will Be Blood, Magnolia, Boogie Nights),&lt;/em&gt; the drama co-stars Amy Adams and features an original score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the movie, we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, sorry for the last minute posting, but I hope you can still make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. It's on 2 screens at the Kendall, and we're going to the 4:30 show. Like always, early ticket purchase is advised.&lt;/p&gt;
