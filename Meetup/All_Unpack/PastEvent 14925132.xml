The first three films could be considered the dark side and the next set of films after the new year will no doubt inspire, educate and motivate.  These films will be held the first Tuesday of each month on the campus of, and co-sponsored by, the University of New England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our November film is &amp;quot;TAPPED&amp;quot; which is about water and, in particular, the bottled water industry.  This is an extremely eye-opening film with direct links to Maine.  &amp;quot;Whiskey is for sipping and water is for fighting.&amp;quot; - Mark Twain.  I highly recommend this film and believe those of us living in such a water-rich state should become versed in the issues at hand.  Ponder whether access to clean drinking water is a basic human right or a commodity to be bought and sold like any other article of commerce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the trailer:  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72MCumz5lq4" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a potluck (bring an appetizer/snack or beverage to share for a grazing-style meal) and your potluck kit (plate/utensils/cup/napkin).  6:30 potluck and 7:00 announcements and film.  Discussion to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lori Power</member_name><member_id>4201073</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289581984000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285690079000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Bad News/Good News Movie Night Series: TAPPED</name><id>14925132</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289345400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/14925132/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/7/global_18330775.jpeg</photo_url></item>
