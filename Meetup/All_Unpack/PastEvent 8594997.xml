You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. For more information see: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/everett" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=117251855265442394172.000454fbf746bc55f3c25&amp;amp;ll=42.408946,-71.07811&amp;amp;spn=0.047657,0.111237&amp;amp;z=14" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Metro nearly kicks us out @ 10 pm we go wine, whine and dine not too far from Everett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you there! &lt;br /&gt;Lopa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. How to find me:&lt;br /&gt;I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black pants and a green/red/blue shirt. I will wait till 7:15 pm and if you arrive after that you'll have to come find me. :) I will have a description of what I'm wearing on the whiteboard near the restrooms.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black pants and a green/red/blue shirt.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Opal</member_name><member_id>3394775</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221433548000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219363882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rock Climbing Boston September Meetup</name><id>8594997</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221260400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8594997/</event_url></item>
