Since she's the event coordinator for the wine dinners at Siena, I'm sure you'll be in great hands.  If you have questions, you can reach her at the restaurant at 401-885-8850&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next Wine Dinner at Siena East Greenwich will be Tuesday, September 28th. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a four course dinner with wine pairings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the night of the event, a representative from The Savory Grape comes to explain the pairings and talk about the wines to every guest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets for this event are sold in advance and are $65 per person with all taxes and gratuity included. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dinner starts at 6:30pm Tuesday, September 28th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>ask for Sarah</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maryanne</member_name><member_id>7323514</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285717447000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-617</urlname><id>790320</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282962280000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wine Dinner at Siena Restaurant in E Greenwich RI</name><id>14568328</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285713000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-617/events/14568328/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/e/global_4123038.jpeg</photo_url></item>
