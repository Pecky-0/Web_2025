With some modicum of discipline, and an exit strategy, we limit the vulture's meal to cocktail hour food, not a 6 course banquet. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over, YET expecting a more favorably result. I hope to describe some possibilities toward avoiding painful drawdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Harlan's Market Update led by Harlan Rieur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harlan gives us his live market analysis on market trends. Using StockCharts.com and his own combination of indicators - Bollinger Bands, stochastic RSI, MACD, Williams%, OBV plus his panoply of moving averages. Always a pleasure for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Screening Using IBD (TM) Method Criteria led by Jeff Orrik&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff will use screens to discover valuable stock tickers. Some will be from the screens that Mike Kinkead uses in his IBD (TM) Method presentation. Other screens will be used to discover stock tickers that work well with other lists. The goal is to find stocks and ETFs at buy points while experimenting with the tools available on Investors.com and using the various talents of everybody in the room. Jeff will weave Blocks into his analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stockpicks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are revising Stockpicks during the next several months.
