Ravenswood is dog friendly, so I'll be bringing Paycee (my dog)...feel free to bring your own canine- and people-friendly pooch, as well as bug spray and water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll walk for about 1-1/2 hrs, then those who would like to can join me at Stage Fort Park (2 miles away) where you can order dinner from&amp;nbsp;The Cupboard (burgers, sandwiches, seafood) or grab an ice cream cone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or&amp;nbsp;bring your own picnic dinner.&amp;nbsp; We can eat at one of the park's picnic tables overlooking the harbour, and after take the short, scenic&amp;nbsp;stroll through the park if we'd like, to finish up the evening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be cancelled due to inclement weather or lack of interest.&amp;nbsp; It is posted with the North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers and Social Fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet near main gate</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306507785000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>We have plenty of daylight to take advantage of a long walk after work, and both parks are beautiful!</why><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304884569000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk at Ravenswood (Gloucester)- followed by dinner at Stage Fort Park</name><id>17624571</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306445400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/17624571/</event_url></item>
