Ave. Plan to meet by the Bank of America, in area of parking that boarders Mass. Ave. &lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of stores at South Bay Center including a gas station, super market ATM's, Target and Home Depot so if you forget something or need something you should be able to get it there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan on &lt;b&gt;leaving about 9:00 AM&lt;/b&gt;, we will head south on the expressway and then down Rt. 3 toward Cape Cod, cross the bridge and then take Rt. 6 into Provincetown.  &lt;br /&gt;We can stop along the way and plan on having lunch in Provincetown. There is no set agenda so..... &lt;br /&gt;what ever we all agree on will be the plan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The distance is about 115 miles each way and the weather should be in the mid 40's so dress accordingly, and bring your cameras.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the parking area that boarders Mass Ave. by Bank of  America</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268141669000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267489344000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston to Provincetown</name><id>12749899</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267968600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/12749899/</event_url></item>
