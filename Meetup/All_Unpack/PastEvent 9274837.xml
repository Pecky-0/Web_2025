Those are are against or are too shy to join the group can sit where he or she wants to sit.  If you do call me, please please remember that you've called me.   Windsor's cell: 617-435-8177.   My plan would be to do the same as before to wait for a few and then those can start a line for us somewhere. I'd wait for more and please and I'll direct you to where the rest are standing in line for us.   Print the pass and you should be fine. Look in the files section to print pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://valkyrie.unitedartists.com/" target="_blank"&gt;VALKYRIE Trailer by Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~`No pressure  either~~~~~ &amp;amp; Sorry for the Delay&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting aside the arcades at 5pm.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232191657000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228338680000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>VALKYRIE - BY TOM CRUISE - ADVANCE SCREENING TONIGHT</name><id>9274837</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228342500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/9274837/</event_url></item>
