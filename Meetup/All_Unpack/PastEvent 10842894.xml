<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>My quest on the Appalachian Trail continues.  I have planned a two day, overnight event for, yes, Monday/Tuesday.  Some of us have the pleasure of summers off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a 21 mile thru hike from Dalton Mass to I-90/Mass Pike.  The first day we will meet at the parking area on Jacobs Ladder Highway (rt.20) near the Mass Pike, exit 2 in Lee at 8:00 a.m.  From there we will take a vehical to the starting spot on Gulf Rd in Dalton Mass.  I hope to be on the trail by 9:00 a.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day will be a bit pushy on mileage.  We are going to hike to the October Mtn. lean to.  This will make for a 13 mile day.  We will head over Day Mtn, Tully Mtn and Warner Hill.  We will over night at the lean to.  Day two we will finish the 8 mile section that will lead back to the car and the Mass Pike.  Obviously we then have to get back to the car in Dalton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a time frames for the time we will finish.  There are too many variables that include what time we break camp on Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email me any questions about this event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This the hike starting place that we will shuttle to:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Dalton&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;address=%5B1-99%5D+Gulf+Rd&amp;amp;zipcode=01226&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=42.48105&amp;amp;longitude=-73.1767&amp;amp;geocode=STREET" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is where we are meeting.
