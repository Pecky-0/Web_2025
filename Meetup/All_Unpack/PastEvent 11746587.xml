This sounds like fun.   Let's meet in at the location below around 9:20am.  My cell is 508-472-7900 if you are lost or running late. I'll be wearing a blue jacket and have reddish hair.  


MassBike Spins Presents: Tour de Grave
 

What: A MassBike trip to some of the Boston area's famous and lesser-known graveyards in honor of Halloween. Trip leaves at 9:30am in order to avoid the majority of ghosts, and will be about 18-20 miles and take about 4 hours.  Steady rain cancels.  Appropriate costumes are encouraged for this ride!


Where: We will meet at the Old Cambridge Burying Ground at the corner of Garden Street and Mass Ave in Harvard Square, and make stops at the following burying grounds and cemeteries: King's Chapel, Granary, Central, South End, Eliot, Evergreen, Market Street, and Cambridge. 

 

At the end of the ride, we will get to explore Mt. Auburn Cemetery.  Mt. Auburn does not allow bike riding. Bring a lock so you can leave your bike at the gate. 

 

When: Saturday October 31, 2009 at 9:30AM
