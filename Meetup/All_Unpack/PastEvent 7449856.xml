Can?t say it didn?t need it!  So for anyone who can make it I?m moving this meetup to Coogan?s which is diagonally across the street from Jose?s.  Coogan's has a sign in the window for a free after work buffet from 5-7pm.  Not sure what that entails but free is free!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll get there around 5pm and probably stay until 8ish.... hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.irishconnection.com/coogans.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.irishconne...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some folks declined the Jose's because they weren't a huge fan of the place.  I'm open for suggestions for other meetups so please feel free to post a shout of your favorite place.   I'll go anywhere(almost) as long as I'm NOT sitting there by myself... and thanks to Leo and Patrick it hasn't happened yet!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please maintain your own tab or pay as you go - Thank You&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be on the bar side to the left as you walk in the door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>SueV</member_name><member_id>6001850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205013774000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>7</count></rating><why>It's Thirsty Thursday.... do you need a better reason!</why><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204513445000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coogans ** Change in Venue **</name><id>7449856</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204840800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/7449856/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/8/global_1419608.jpeg</photo_url></item>
