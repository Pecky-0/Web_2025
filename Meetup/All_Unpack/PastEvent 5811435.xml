She wrote a book about her life and personal spiritual journey.  It is called Giving Birth to God: a woman?s path to enlightenment.  She was a home birth midwife for 17 years and a mother of 4 children. Currently, she lives in Colorado and travels throughout the country giving lectures and classes, about peace and having a one on one connection to your inner Self. She only comes to Boston 3 times a year so you don?t want to miss it.  The fee is to cover her airfare.  Please join me at this special event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the blurb... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday June 1, 7 pm &lt;br /&gt;Mercy &amp;amp; Forgiveness: Essential Steps to Being Healed &lt;br /&gt;Come to know the right timing and process of forgiveness.
