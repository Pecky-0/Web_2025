We kick off with FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE starring the dangerously debonair Sean Connery as the one true Bond. Communism and the still ginormous Soviet empire hasn?t a chance up against the ingenious gadgetry and sex appeal of a lone British agent who is licensed to kill. Next up is, with the all-time best opening song (at least until Amy Winehouse gets her act together). Sean Connery is back behind the wheel with co-stars Gert Frobe, Harold Sakata and his very nasty bowler hat, and Honor Blackman as, yes, Pussy Galore. To be fair, this time it?s a capitalist that?s spoiling for a fight, with a diabolical plot to radiate Fort Knox. Sophisticated, suspenseful and hip, it?s no surprise the original Bond films continue to spawn (mostly lesser) descendants, from Octopussy to The Bourne Supremacy to, well, Goldmember. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE&lt;br /&gt;GOLDFINGER &lt;br /&gt;(1963,1964)&lt;br /&gt;118 min, 94 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Director: Terence Young.

There's construction on the Trinity Campus so it's not as easy to get to theater. There's a file in the file section with directions.
