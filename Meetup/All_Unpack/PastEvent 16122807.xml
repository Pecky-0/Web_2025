<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'll be in Jefferson the weekend of the 29th/30th, and am looking for a hike. Reputation of Owl's Head is spectacular views. I am expecting this hike to be in snowshoes, though if conditions allow light traction, of course, that's what we'll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this with more details next week. Cherry Mountain Trail trailhead is on Rt 115. Lot is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; plowed in winter, so parking will need to be roadside (unless one of you happens to have a plow handy...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start time is currently flexible. If you are interested, and would prefer earlier or later, let me know. I will be staying at the Applebrook a couple of miles away [full].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hikenewengland.com/MarthaOwlsHeadNH090818.html" target="_blank"&gt;Trail description&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RT: 5.4 mi&lt;br /&gt;Book Time: about 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan 25 Update:&lt;br /&gt;==========&lt;br /&gt;Weather and trail conditions are, of course, hard to predict. But it looks like there's about 2 feet of snow on the ground in that area, with the last 6 inches or so falling on the 19th and 22nd. The last trail condition report was on the 10th, just before the last major storm.  The trail may or may not be broken out, but any snow that is there has had a while to consolidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accuweather puts the high on Saturday in Jefferson/Twin Mountain area at 24, which will be wicked warm compared to the -4 degrees from camping last weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any winter trip, if the conditions are bad, we'll turn back and go get a beer instead. We'll set a mutually agreed turn-around time before departing the trailhead. The summit is optional, returning to the trailhead is mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>JCarter</member_name><member_id>11575712</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296437612000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295554806000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Martha/Owl's Head via Cherry Mountain Trail/Martha's Mile</name><id>16122807</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296311400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/16122807/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/1/2/global_13643906.jpeg</photo_url></item>
