What could be more fun than enjoying a mimosa while watching Jimmy Stewart learn the value of his life with the help of Clarence Oddbody, Angel Second Class?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie started at 11 am and I'll be in the lobby at 10:30 am. I know that this movie has drawn a pretty big crowd in the past so I will probably head in for seats around 10:40am so that we can all get seats together. I'll have my cell phone turned on until the movie starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is $5 or $4 with a Criterion member card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life" target="_blank"&gt;It's a Wonderful Life on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/" target="_blank"&gt;It's a Wonderful Life on IMDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Andrea&lt;br /&gt;203-641-8083&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Check out my meetup picture.
