Similarly, though we may believe that God loves us, and though we may really hope that God does, until we actually feel God’s love for us, we don’t know for sure that we are loved by God. Mystics have always sought to find out for themselves, through direct experience, whether God is real and whether God loves them. This seminar will help you begin to know how you can experience God and open to feel God’s love, so that God becomes not just a belief but an actual reality you can feel and come to know.Once you know for sure that you are completely loved and that God is real, you will be able to relax into life and into peace.&lt;/p&gt;
