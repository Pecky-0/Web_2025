Remember the Red line is way messed up on weekends so either allow extra time or seek alternative routes on Saturday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok with all those action movies, I thought it might be nice for a change of pace to do a  chick flick musical.    The name of the  movie is Mamma Mia! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the event with an exact time closer to the event.        To find me, if the movie is upstairs, I will try to grab a table near the coffee vendor but will be somewhere in that area.  If the movie is downstairs, I will be just inside the ropes near the ticket taker.   For any who do not know me I will be wearing my Boston Movie Group Badge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, the last time I did a Saturday event the Red line was a mess with busing and construction projects.      So you might want to check the MBTA web site before heading in to town, if that it the train line that you usually ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studio: Universal Pictures &lt;br /&gt;Director: Phyllida Lloyd &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Catherine Johnson &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper, Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Meryl Streep leads an all-star cast in the feature-film adaptation of the beloved musical that has been seen by more than 30 million people in 160 cities and 8 languages around the world. Bringing the timeless lyrics and melodies of iconic super group ABBA to movie audiences, Summer 2008 is the season for &amp;quot;Mamma Mia!&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three women who created the worldwide smash stage hit--global producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson and director Phyllida Lloyd--repeat their roles in bringing this joyful, musical story to the big screen. The Mamma Mia! film is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper join Streep in this celebration of a mother, a daughter and three possible dads.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An independent, single mother who owns a small hotel on an idyllic Greek island, Donna (Streep) is about to let go of Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), the spirited daughter she's raised alone. For Sophie's wedding, Donna has invited her two lifelong best girlfriends--practical and no-nonsense Rosie (Julie Walters) and wealthy, multi-divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski)--from her one-time backing band, Donna and the Dynamos. But Sophie has secretly invited three guests of her own.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a quest to find the identity of her father to walk her down the aisle, she brings back three men from Donna's past to the Mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier. Over 24 chaotic, magical hours, new love will bloom and old romances will be rekindled on this lush island full of possibilities.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the storytelling magic of ABBA's&amp;quot;&amp;gt;ABBA's songs from &amp;quot;Dancing Queen&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;S.O.S.&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Money, Money, Money&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Take a Chance on Me,&amp;quot; Mamma Mia! is a celebration of mothers and daughters, old friends and new family found.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222684029000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214833838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mamma Mia!</name><id>8245329</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216509300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/8245329/</event_url></item>
