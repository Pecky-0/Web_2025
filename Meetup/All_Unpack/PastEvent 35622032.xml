There are several great apple picking farms near where I live, but Berlin Orchards is the one we go to every year. In addition to lots and lots of apples they have a small covered area for snack or lunch and a few animals for the kids to look at. You can also find more information here: &lt;a href="http://www.berlinorchards.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.berlinorch...&lt;/a&gt;. The parking area is located at the junction of Rt. 62 and Lower Sawyer Hill Road in Berlin. Turn onto Lower Sawyer Road and the parking area will be on your left. I'd like to meet between 9:45 and 10 and then pick apples until about noon. After that I need to take my daughter home for a nap, but everyone is welcome to stay longer. The orchard is open until 5 pm. Apple prices at the farm are as follows: 1/2 bushel (about 20lbs) for $25.00 and 1 peck (about 10lbs) for $15.00. I'm sure we can split bags between several folks if that is too many apples for you. Hope to see you all there.
