Meet new friends in a fun non-threatening atmosphere. Just bring with you some child-like playfulness and an openness to laugh and connect with other people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laughter has many proven physical benefits: It boosts the immune system's production of disease-fighting T-cells, releases endorphins that serve as natural pain killers and make us feel good, helps reduce stress, anxiety &amp;amp; blood pressure by lowering the level of the stress hormone cortisol, provides aerobic exercise &amp;amp; promotes muscle tone, increases blood flow thereby bringing more oxygen to body cells. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our evening will be based on activities used in Laughter Yoga, a branch of Yoga developed in India by Dr Madan Kataria. There are now over 6,000 Laughter Yoga clubs all around the world. If you never done any yoga before don't worry--NO physical yoga postures or poses will be used. &lt;br /&gt;Laughter Yogaâ„¢ is not recommended for people suffering from uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, epilepsy, any kind of hernia , severe backache and major psychiatric disorders. If in doubt about your medical condition consult a medical professional for guidance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donations are gratefully accepted (Suggested donation $3-$5) &lt;br /&gt;Come and join us !&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Route 91 Exit 18 left turn 1st bldg. on right: 2nd floor-- follow the cones!"</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245452695000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244496345000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Laugh for Your Health with Sir-Laugh-a-lot! </name><id>10606471</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245279600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/10606471/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
