Want some help keeping on track? Hoping to meet others who are also available on a weekday afternoon? Well then, bring your work, a positive attitude and a resolution to get things done and let's change all that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll each grab a drink and share our goals for the &amp;quot;study session&amp;quot; and then get to work.  With so many members who are self-employed, unemployed, in graduate school, etc. it's nice to know we are not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Don't worry if you need to come late or leave early...you are still welcome to join us! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** If you drive to Davis Square, be sure to bring plenty of quarters for the meters! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Walk all the way to the back...I'll try to grab the big table in the back left corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There will be a small brown basket in the center of the table...probably filled with writing utensils</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271870431000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271424692000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Time for Coffee</name><id>13199524</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271696400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/13199524/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/8/global_6854760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
