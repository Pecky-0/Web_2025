It's a competition between restaurants in the greater Boston area for the best New England style clam chowder. The Harborfest is a week-long celebration of Boston's maritime and colonial history, which culminates with fireworks on July 4th at the Charles Rive Esplanade.&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Chowderfest takes place in a gated area on City Hall Plaza. A booth is set up on the day of the event to purchase tickets. In 2006, the cost for a ticket was $10 per adult, with 10 restaurants and 2 navy ships participating in the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visitors walk up to the canopy of each of the participating restaurants and are given a sample of clam chowder. You can sample as much chowder as you like, and can re-try your favorite chowder. When you have had your fill, you can vote for what you considered to be the best chowder. At the close of the event, the votes are tallied and a winner is announced. An area of tables is set up if you'd like to sit down, with an adjacent beverage tent. In 2006, a ragtime band strolled the crowd, and a group of redcoats escorted the Mayor into the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The style of chowder can vary from thin and soupy with minced clams, to extremely thick and creamy with potatoes. If you are a big fan of clam chowder, this competition is a must-see event. If you are a tourist, it's a great way to sample varying kinds of a local food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See More PHOTOS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phone Number: 617.227.1528&lt;br /&gt;Web Address: www.bostonharborfest.com/main/chowderfest.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return to Boston Events Calendar&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We'll meet at 11:00 a.m. in front of the Steaming Kettle in Government Center.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183475406000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181752961000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BOSTON CHOWDERFEST</name><id>5887208</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183302000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/5887208/</event_url></item>
