There is a building and a metal &lt;br /&gt;Guard rail there if you try to drive out that small&lt;br /&gt;Drive way.   I would recommend going back out&lt;br /&gt;Via the Medical Center Parking Lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some parking on Orchard Street, then you can&lt;br /&gt;Walk to Center Street &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The businesses are from right to left facing that side&lt;br /&gt;169/ Mia Boutique, Eden Attorney, Ecuama, Jakes Tavern,&lt;br /&gt;Medical Center and some Reality Co.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two doors on Center Street leading&lt;br /&gt;Into the Tavern, but I went in the door to the&lt;br /&gt;Left through the bar area.&lt;br /&gt;Go towards the back of the Tavern where there is a&lt;br /&gt;Large lounge area with a Big TV Screen.&lt;br /&gt;That is where the Band will be playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did reserve a table in my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members of Unknown Zone &lt;br /&gt;Meet Up Group are welcome to come&lt;br /&gt;Listen to some music from the 1970s to 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did ask and coffee is also served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading up Wallingford history,  Jakes Tavern was one of the locations&lt;br /&gt;Used in A.D. Calvo film of The Other Side of the Tracks.   &lt;br /&gt;I never saw the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Connecticut" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford,_Connecticut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some members at Jakes to hear some rock and roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This depends on the weather.&lt;br /&gt;This Meet Up will be cancelled if there is a heavy&lt;br /&gt;Snow Storm or Ice Storm.  Members Safety comes first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably take I 91 N to Exit 13 to &lt;br /&gt;Right on Rte 5 to Right on 150 / Center Street.&lt;br /&gt;I used to work in that area years ago and that is the&lt;br /&gt;Way that I am more comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than likely Maribeth and myself might be the only&lt;br /&gt;Two members of Unknown Zone going to the gig.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving Maribeth a ride there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am aware that other Unknown Zone Members have other&lt;br /&gt;Meet Ups to attend on the 19th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Members see my photo in the link.
