Join Captain Keith Lincoln aboard the Rip Ryder for some of the best ocean fun and adventure available on Cape Cod. The Rip Ryder V is a new 31â€™-40 passenger Beachcat Catamaran. We invite you to come along for a day of exploration off the coast of Chatham, Cape Cod. Marvel at the natural beauty of the Monomoy Islands. Watch the seals frolic and bask in the sun while the many protected native bird species fly above. The cruise is $30.00 per person. Each woman is responsible for her own ticket. The seal cruise is 90 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be in the parking lot of Burger King in Hyannis at Midcape Highway, Exit 6 on Route 132 and can carpool with three other people to Chatham. Others interested in carpooling should also plan to meet there at 10:00 AM. If you choose not to carpool, you can meet us at the Monomoy Island Refuge by 11:00AM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Monomoy Island Refuge: Once on Cape Cod, drive east on Rt. 6 to Exit 11 (Rt. 137). At the end of the off ramp, turn left onto 137 south. Follow 137 south till it terminates at Rt. 28. Turn left onto Rt. 28 south and follow all the way to Chatham Center. At the rotary, continue straight on Main St. through the business district. Go past the Chatham Lighthouse and Coast Guard Station (on the right). Bear left at the fork in the road. Take your first right (Morris Island Rd.). Look for directional sign - Rip Ryder Monomoy Island Ferry. Follow this road until you see the brown sign for the USFWS Headquarters (Tisquantum Rd.). Take your first left (Wikis Way). The ferry is located at the bottom of the stairs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Barbara will be wearing her Girls Just Wanna Have Fun pin!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barbara </member_name><member_id>7313867</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278983584000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
