You might be supportive of a particular conspiracy theory or you might be opposed to it, but there is a good chance that whichever way your opinion falls it is passionate.  Some people seem to have a natural affinity or attraction to conspiracy theories while others are equally disposed to debunk them all.  What’s up with conspiracy theories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conspiracy theories may have profound philosophical significance for two reasons: First, a particular theory can reveal certain fundamental values or predispositions about those who strongly favor or disfavor it.  Second, the controversy about conspiracy theories may say something about our notions of the truth and what constitutes the grounds or justification for belief or disbelief.  Philosophically, however, there is perhaps only one way to approach these theories, which is to question whether they are reasonable or unreasonable and to do so with an open mind and—to the extent possible—to produce judgments that are undistorted by bias and preconception.  With this attitude it is likely that we will have a fair share of conspiracy theories that either seem reasonable or appear to have the preponderance of evidence on their side, as well as those that appear to have little merit or justification and are likely the result of whimsy or distortion &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; prejudice.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subject of conspiracy theories contains a wealth of material that should prove to be a stimulus for heated debate and lots of good-spirited entertainment as well.  There are right-wing and left-wing conspiracies, and conspiracies of all description.  For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The assassination of JFK is probably the biggest of all contemporary conspiracy theories, and were the assassinations of MLK and RFK in some way connected?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The assassination of Abraham Lincoln remains a serious topic for historians.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UFO phenomenon.  Has there been a government cover-up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We’ve had Communist conspiracy theories and now we have the Illuminati, Bilderbergers, and the Federal Reserve conspiracies.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The deaths of the hugely popular figures of Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;911&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no shortage of conspiracy theories for us to examine, and the above list does not even scratch the surface.  Let me quote Ayn Rand,  a philosopher that I generally disagree with but like very much when she says that you need to,  “Check your premises!” when staking out a position in an intellectual argument.  Conspiracy theory is a different sort of topic than the ones discussed thus far by this group and I have a theory about it.   The conspiracy theory can be a vehicle to reveal and discover philosophically hidden agendas.  But hidden or not, our true agenda regarding conspiracy theories should be to learn the truth or, at least, to establish unbiased grounds for believing or disbelieving them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/pages/No_Show_Policy/"&gt;No Show Policy&lt;/a&gt; (please read)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271027245000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268496631000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Philosophy of Conspiracy</name><id>12866440</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270854000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/events/12866440/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/6/global_7925510.jpeg</photo_url></item>
