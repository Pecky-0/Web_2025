Starting in September, gather your master tacticians and rules experts together to kick down the dungeon doors and begin the assault! D&amp;amp;D Lair Assault is a new Wizards Play Network in-store program that pits tactically-minded players against a super challenge where the difference between victory and defeat is dependent upon your game knowledge, ability to adapt, and a little bit of luck. You'll pit your wits against some of the most difficult encounters you've ever played. Each challenge is a mega-encounter that plays in just a few hours, but many will need to make more than one run at it in pursuit of victory. Each run of the lair will likely take between 2-3 hours. Players can replay the encounter as many times as they like, and indeed will need to do so if they are hoping to claim all of the recognition possible through the program. Our intention is to offer this several times during the months of September and October for players to try. Character creation rules can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20110822" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20110822&lt;/a&gt; (scroll to the bottom of the page, they highlight it there particularly). Comment if you have any questions or concerns. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318868303000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318198442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D Lair Assault</name><id>36760442</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318456800000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/36760442/</event_url></item>
