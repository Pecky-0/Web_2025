The best way to play Honk Fest is to check out the Band Schedule on line and proceed to your favorite bands hourly. It is a special treat at 12 Noon to be in the Square and watch all of the bands converge on 7 Hills Park for the opening ceremonies. Or just show up later as there is no way to keep a group together with so much talent to catch.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, October 9th from Noon to 9pm over 25 activist street bands from around the country and beyond, perform outdoors in multiple locations in Davis Square for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information, schedules and updates will be available at www.honkfest.org &lt;a href="http://www.honkfest.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or 617-383-4665.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not properly describe the Honk! Fest. You must go to their web site for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a long day. Arrive early, later or in the middle of the mayhem. I will be attending Honk Fest with some friends as I have since its birth. We will be taking a break for dinner at Mike's Restaurant in the heart of Davis Square. Maybe we will catch part of one of the American or National  League Playoff Games too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who want to meetup with us should e mail me their cell phone numbers or e mail other attending Natives to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fenway Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>6893072</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286665346000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284408410000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Honk!
