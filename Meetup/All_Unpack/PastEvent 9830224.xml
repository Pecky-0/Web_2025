We will start at 2pm sharp, play until 4:30pm, and then discuss and analyze our gameplay afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the doors are locked, please enter through Ell Hall (to the right if facing Dodge Hall).  You'll have to go downstairs and make a few turns through the tunnels to get into Dodge Hall, then have to come upstairs to the main lobby.  May be a little challenging, but just ask around and you'll find us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>From main entrance, first classroom on the left</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238962499000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235669941000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March 22 Cashflow Meetup</name><id>9830224</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237744800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/9830224/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
