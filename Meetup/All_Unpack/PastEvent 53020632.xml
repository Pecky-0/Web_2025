No longer is the Pagan religion only for academic studies. Nor a is it a derogatory term to describe non-Christians. Once more Paganism is a positive, spiritual, living faith. As the world enters a post-Christian epoch and a somewhat post-rationalist period in western society we explore the past and find answers for the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly walk a Pagan path, many people believe that their spirituality should be part of their daily life, and not just something the observe once or twice a month. Here's where we'll talk about contemporary issues of interest to Pagans, family and relationships, and how to live a magical life every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class begins at 6PM followed by Open Circle, all are invited. &lt;br /&gt;
