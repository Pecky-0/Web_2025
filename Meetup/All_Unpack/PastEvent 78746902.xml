I am putting together another Shiba Inu meet up. Last time we had about 17 Shibas show up, and this weekend we hope to have just as many. We will meet at 11:00 AM at the Zero New Washington St Dog Park in Somerville, MA. Last time we met on the South Shore, so this time we will aim for the Boston are. I have been to this park on several occasions. It is a great park, all fenced in, lots of water, lots of running room, shade, and ramps and tubes for the pups to play in/on. There is plenty of street parking in front of the park, and its fairly easy to get to. &lt;br /&gt;

Here is the address &lt;br /&gt;

0 New Washington Street &lt;br /&gt;

Somerville, MA 02143&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Yelp page for the dog park as well!&lt;/p&gt;
