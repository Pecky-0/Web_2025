&lt;p&gt;Go beyond compost for vibrant, long-lasting, resilient landscapes that resist disease, pests and weeds. One-hour workshop followed by a half hour of questions and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successive generations of land use have depleted Northeast soils of minerals essential to plant health. As a result, landscapes are at a heightened susceptibility to pests, disease, and weeds. Compost, organic fertilizers, and biological inoculants are inadequate to correct these deficits-- however, when applied to soil with a restored mineral profile, their effectiveness can be maximized. In this workshop, soil fertility expert Dan Kittredge will explain the scientific principles of soil re-mineralization, plant health, and resilience in landscape ecosystems; he will also suggest some ways to identify and address deficits for healthier organic landscapes and gardens.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mindy</member_name><member_id>6980975</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345774474000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Urban-Homesteaders-League</urlname><id>1466080</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Urban Homesteaders' League</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343698513000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Remineralize the Landscape</name><id>75626422</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345762800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Urban-Homesteaders-League/events/75626422/</event_url></item>
