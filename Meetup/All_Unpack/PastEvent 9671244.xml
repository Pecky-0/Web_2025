A real spiritual teacher is able to bring you into a direct experience of the God-Self within. Such teachers can see the next step on your personal spiritual journey, because they have traveled the path before you. In this seminar, we will discuss the key ingredients of what makes a teacher a teacher and how to find the right one for you.&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the presenter&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher.
