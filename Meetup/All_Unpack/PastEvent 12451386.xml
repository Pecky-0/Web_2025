However, during his younger days, Cotton’s involvement in a sexual scandal almost cost him his career and forced him to reinvent himself. Join Len Travers, professor of history at UMASS Dartmouth, as he explores the letters of John Cotton, Jr. and illustrates how his correspondence sheds light on late 17th Century New England life. &amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Begins&lt;/b&gt;: 2/4/2010 12:15 PM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Ends&lt;/b&gt;: 2/4/2010 1:00 PM &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price&lt;/b&gt;: $5; Free for members &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J.

Before coming to UMass Dartmouth, Travers worked at the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston, and before that was Director of Interpretation at Plimoth Plantation in Plymouth, Massachusetts. His teaching focuses on the history of early America, and Northeast regional history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;His published works include Celebrating the Fourth: Independence Day and the Rites of Nationalism in the Early Republic (1997); Encyclopedia of American Holidays and National Days (2006); and The Correspondence of John Cotton, Jr., 1640-1699 (2009). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Currently he is conducting research for a book on war, captivity, and survival during the French and Indian War&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Old South Meeting House, Wikipedia&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_South_Meeting_House" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Old South Meeting House, in the Downtown Crossing area of Boston, Massachusetts, gained fame as the organizing point for the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. 5,000 colonists gathered at the Meeting House, the largest building in Boston at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] After the Boston Massacre in 1770, yearly anniversary meetings were held at the church until 1775 featuring speakers such as John Hancock and Dr. Joseph Warren. In 1773 5,000 people met in the Meeting House to debate British taxation, and after the meeting a group raided a nearby tea ship in what became known as the Boston Tea Party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] Old South Meeting House was almost destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872, and the congregation then built a new church (the 'New' Old South Church at Copley Square) which remains its home to this day. Once twice a year, on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, the Old South congregation returns to Old South Meeting House for services in its ancestral home&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
