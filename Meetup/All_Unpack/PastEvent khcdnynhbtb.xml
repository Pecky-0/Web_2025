<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will be drumming.  Bring a native drum of your own or use one of those supplied!  You will have a good time with Cliff Madru, who has been drumming for many years and has discovered many spiritual truths through his work with the drums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be ready for a good time, good food, and good conversation.  Bring enough to feed at least four people and we start at 6 PM!   See you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, people who are not on the meetup list attend, so do not be discouraged by the numbers of RSVP's!   You can also find us on Facebook where you can get the Exercises of the Week to help with your spiritual connections.
