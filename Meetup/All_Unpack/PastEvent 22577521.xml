DIRT! brings to life the environmental, economic, social and political impact that the soil has. It tells the story of Earth's most valuable and under-appreciated source of fertility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you! These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It's also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that's truly helping the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The June Conscious Movie is Dirt! All donations will support the Sophia Peace Center&amp;rsquo;s soil conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309047140000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308335456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup for June - Dirt</name><id>22577521</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309042800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/22577521/</event_url></item>
