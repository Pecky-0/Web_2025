<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will continue with Part 2: Of Common-Wealth from Hobbes' Leviathan (Penguin Classics ISBN: 0-140-43195-0). This is even more text for the next two weeks than we had for the previous 3 weeks (we had 3 weeks between the last meeting and the one before). Our plan is to cover Part 2 and Part 3 in the next 3 meetings so reading 2/3 of part 2 for the next time is what is really needed. Let's have an interesting reading and a good meeting like the last one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191107173000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189737088000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thomas Hobbes: Leviathan II</name><id>6355941</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190934000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/6355941/</event_url></item>
