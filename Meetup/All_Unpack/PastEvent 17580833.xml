But first, we all had to get through Basic Training in the murky swamps of Mississippi.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biloxi Blues saw a remarkably successful run on Broadway back in the mid-1980s. It even took home the Tony Award for Best Play. That was before it became a major Hollywood motion picture in 1988, starring Matthew Broderick as Eugene; Christopher Walken as the tough-as-nails (yet off-his-rocker) Sgt. Toomey; and Penelope Ann Miller as the girl of Eugene&amp;rsquo;s dreams, Daisy Hannigan. The film, directed by Mike Nichols (of The Graduate), was #1 in theaters its opening weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as America is embroiled in a variety of simultaneous wars, and our armed services are in the middle of repealing a long-held &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Ask, Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell&amp;rdquo; policy, the themes explored in the 1940s-era Biloxi Blues are as quaint as they are cutting-edge and perfectly relevant to an entirely new generation of theatergoers. But the best part? It&amp;rsquo;s Neil Simon at his best, and just plain fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directed by Kathleen Cavalaro, and Biloxi Blues stars Will MacDonald, Jon Cilley, Elizabeth Locke O&amp;rsquo;Connell, Merlin Money Mason, Brandon Nigro, Laura Thomas, Samuel Bennett, Dan Stowell, and Brian Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;

The Players' Ring is located in a nineteenth century brick building on Marcy Street on the grounds of Prescott Park in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The historic building is owned by the City of Portsmouth and is fitted out as a &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; theatre. With a seating capacity of 75, The Players' Ring annual attendance is approximately 6,500. Since its creation, more than 30 local production companies have presented plays at The Players' Ring. While some form to produce a single special event, some production companies produce shows on an annual basis. Over 200 actors, directors, playwrights and technicians work together to produce plays at The Players' Ring each year. Over the past five years, over $180,000 has been distributed to those involved in Players' Ring productions. Original works account for half of each season&amp;rsquo;s offerings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry Pilla</member_name><member_id>7841451</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306179947000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Seacoasters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastOutdoors</urlname><id>1441594</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Seacoast Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304797616000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biloxi Blues @ The Players' Ring</name><id>17580833</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306019700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastOutdoors/events/17580833/</event_url></item>
