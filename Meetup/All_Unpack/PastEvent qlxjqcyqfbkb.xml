<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a CPR Eduction campaign the other day. All active adults &amp;nbsp;need to take a minute and review. This is a clever video, but gets the message across. &amp;nbsp;It was a no-brainer that I had to share it with our group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If CPR is started within 4 minutes of collapse and defibrillation provided within 10 minutes a person has a 40% chance of survival.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take 10 minutes and review the new Hands-only CPR. it's easy, the video is fun, hopefully we never need to use it, but if you have to take action- your training will kick in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hiking Meetups get our heart pumping, often many times in remote areas. -we may be relying only on our hiking partners for any life saving assistance we might need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being physically active, many of us have had first aid training- but has CPR changed? You ask, what are the rules this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to recertify every year in the Guard, and the trainer would always start by reminding us, you cant hurt a dead man. He has a 50% better chance of survival if you try than if you don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the trail, we recommend groups of 4 or more, in case there is an&amp;nbsp;emergency. Call 911 for a rescue, send other hikers for help, but start CPR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPR Facts:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in adults. Most arrests occur in persons with underlying heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CPR doubles a person's chance of survival from sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75% of all cardiac arrests happen in people's homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical victim of cardiac arrest is a man in his early 60's and a woman in her late 60's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiac arrest occurs twice as frequently in men compared to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPR was invented in 1960&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been a case of HIV transmitted by mouth-to-mouth CPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In sudden cardiac arrest the heart goes from a normal heartbeat to a quivering rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF). This happens in approximately 2/3rds of all cardiac arrests. VF is fatal unless an electric shock, called defibrillation, can be given. CPR does not stop VF but CPR extends the window of time in which defibrillation can be effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CPR provides a trickle of oxygenated blood to the brain and heart and keeps these organs alive until defibrillation can shock the heart into a normal rhythm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
