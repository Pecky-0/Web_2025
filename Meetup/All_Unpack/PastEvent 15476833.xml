All I gotta say is they better have some PBR on tap, LOL. We will be meeting at Cambridge Common for some tasty beverages and some classic american dinner fair.... or is it fare? Parking can be horrendous so give yourself some extra time to find a spot. We will try and get a table between 6-7pm on December 11th. Make sure to RSVP so I know how many people are coming and how big of a table we need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO FIND US? I will be dressed to impress so you can pick me out of a crowd and introduce yourself. Details to come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are running late, lost, cant find us, etc just call or text me. My number is 414 217 2145&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge Common is a comfy, welcoming neighborhood restaurant offering our celebrated comfort food, huge portions, cheap prices, and a full bar with 30 beers on tap (well, 31 when the Cask is on), 16 of which rotate like nobody's business, always one organic brew, a kick-ass bottle or two, and a sizzlin' burger for only $4.95. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUICK FACTS:&lt;br /&gt;Event is open to anyone that enjoys the company of some good ol' midwestern people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location for your GPS if driving &lt;br /&gt;1667 Massachusetts Ave&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge, MA 02138&lt;br /&gt;Neighborhood: Porter Square&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are taking the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; get on the Red Line and the location is between Harvard and Porter Square stops.
