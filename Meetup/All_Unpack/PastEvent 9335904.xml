You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. Call them for details.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>7:00 PM at the picnic table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229736146000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229270593000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Everett Metrorock: Monday Night</name><id>9335904</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229385600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/9335904/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/9/global_6619369.jpeg</photo_url></item>
