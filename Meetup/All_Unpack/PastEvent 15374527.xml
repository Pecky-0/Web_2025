But what will you do with the data? The information? How will it be regulated? Join The Bioscience Network for a lively discussion with three luminaries in the field of whole genome sequencing. Speakers include: &lt;br /&gt;-Kevin Davies, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of BioIT World and author of the recently released The $1,000 Genome &lt;br /&gt;-George Church, PhD, Professor of Genetics, Harvard Medical School and Director of the Center for Computational Genetics, author of over 200 articles in peer-reviewed journals and founder of, or advisor to, over 20 companies including Knome and PersonalGenomes.org&lt;br /&gt; -Philip Reilly, MD, JD, bioethicist, author of The Strongest Boy in the World: How Genetic Information is Shaping Our Life (Cold Spring Harbor Press), CMO of bluebird bio, and Venture Partner at Third Rock Ventures in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;These experts will join in a panel discussion of the commercial, clinical and ethical issues associated with whole genome sequencing. Both authors will be available to sign copies of their books, which will be available for purchase at the event. Enjoy formal and informal networking opportunities, as well as gaining inspiration and insight from our speakers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Lang</member_name><member_id>3926861</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291939911000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Scientific Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nexusproject</urlname><id>1294865</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Nexus Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289186386000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An elite panel discussion and networking event from The Bioscience Network</name><id>15374527</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291935600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nexusproject/events/15374527/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/c/global_12600668.jpeg</photo_url></item>
