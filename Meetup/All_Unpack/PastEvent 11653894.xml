We will be looking for someone to chair the event as well as volunteers to head up the various committees (marketing, vendors, tea cup auction, contests, entertainment/attractions, etc).  Please contact Paul at PaulPSWJC@aol.com with questions or if you can't attend the meeting, but would like to be a part of the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Petrillo</member_name><member_id>8764866</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257190784000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255885945000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paws in the Park Committee Kick Off</name><id>11653894</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256770800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/11653894/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/8/global_9531176.jpeg</photo_url></item>
