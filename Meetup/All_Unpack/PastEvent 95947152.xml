&lt;p&gt;hi ladies! my friend is in this and i will need to let her know by thursday at 7pm if I want to reserve a few tickets...they are $20 each. i went last year and it is wonderful. it is last minute, but i am going and wanted to see if anyone is interested in meeting up . if i get a response, i need to be pretty sure of a head count before i reserve the number. i think we can pay at the door. we should arrive no later than 3:30 we could do a light dinner afterwards...thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356307952000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355953243000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christmas concert at merrimack college, andover</name><id>95947152</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1356296400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/95947152/</event_url></item>
