<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>As agreed on last meetup at Longfellow Place, we will also be meeting at Cafe Paradisio on Sunday, January 23rd at 4:00 PM in an effort to accomodate as many members as possible. So, we'll meet this Wednesday the 19th at 8:00 PM and this Sunday the 23rd at 4:00 PM at Cafe Paradisio. This arrangement might be temporary. We'll probably have to fine tune it in the future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Salut a tous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frantz&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frantz P</member_name><member_id>1701364</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>20</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchConversationGroup</urlname><id>63770</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston French Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1105308482000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston French Language January Meetup</name><id>4040905</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1106182800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchConversationGroup/events/4040905/</event_url></item>
