For each&lt;br /&gt;person that volunteers to be an usher, the NHLA gets money (which goes&lt;br /&gt;100% into the Political Action Fund and will be used to fund&lt;br /&gt;candidates for this November).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if we get over a certain number of people there that day, our&lt;br /&gt;money gets a power-up (like the mushroom in Mario)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a call out: ANYONE who has Sept 13th free, e-mail me&lt;br /&gt;(shuvom@comcast. net) or Carol Mcguire (treasurer@nhliberty .org) if you&lt;br /&gt;want to: &lt;br /&gt;1. Get a free pass to feel souped up cars fly by you at 200+ MPH&lt;br /&gt;2. Help with our biggest fundraiser of the year for deserving liberty&lt;br /&gt;candidates in NH. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: the day is long, and you will be in the sun and loud noise&lt;br /&gt;for a good part of it. I did this event two years ago (had to skip&lt;br /&gt;last year because of my wedding) and was glad I brought two sets of&lt;br /&gt;earplugs and water. But I can still feel my chest vibrating from&lt;br /&gt;those monsters flying by! It's a rush! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Every person that shows up means more money for liberty candidates.&lt;br /&gt;Ask you friends to join up.&lt;br /&gt;The more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dreepa</member_name><member_id>4145573</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222016467000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220898093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHLA day at the races</name><id>8715087</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221325200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/8715087/</event_url></item>
