&lt;p&gt;The parking and launch is on Route 135 between Hopkinton and Westborough centers, approx 42.24166 North and -71.57316 West.  Do not program "Whitehall State Park" into your GPS. That will not take you to the launch site.  The nearest side road is Dale Road in Hopkinton, just west of the parking lot entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch ramp at this venue is well used by fishing boats, so please be courteous and do not block the paved ramp with your car, belongings or kayak.  There is plenty of room to launch on either side of the ramp.  I do not expect problems with parking, but with the expectation of lots of people coming after us, we should double up in the spaces or park on the grass to allow those who need trailer spots to park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PLEASE NOTE - The organizers in this group are NOT trained leaders or instructors.  The organizers only set the time and place, each person participating in any group trip is responsible for their own safety.  Each participant is responsible for evaluating all relevant conditions for the trip and determining if their skills and equipment are appropriate for those conditions.)&lt;/p&gt;
