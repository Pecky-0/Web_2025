Cutler park has a nice boardwalk through the marsh.  Meet at 10 in the parking lot.  Afterwards we will go for lunch at Fresh City.  If you need a ride, please say so in your RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seven hundred acres known as Cutler Park comprise the largest remaining fresh water marsh on the middle Charles. Located in Needham and Dedham, the marsh and small lake attract over 100 species of birds which make Cutler Park a prime spot for nature study.
