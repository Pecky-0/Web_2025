<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The DoggieDay Playcenter invites you to our monthly, indoor meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup continues to grow and be a great opportunity to let all the puggies get to know each other and the puggie parents share their experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added feature, we will have additional groomers and bathers available from 10-2 offering a reduced rate for all of our puggies to get their nails done, their ears cleaned and a bath. This is will be a self bathing session, so you'll do the washing and cleaning and nail cutting by our groomers, you do the drying and brushing. The rate will be $20.00 per dog, and it should be a fun time to have the group involved in the process! We'll need to know how many pugs will be participating, so if you could just shoot an e-mail to robgaleski@doggieday.com, we'll be able to plan accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2407140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1147097043000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pug Devotee Extraordinaires</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-73</urlname><id>126274</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>45</yes_rsvp_count><created>1143907463000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Pug May Meetup</name><id>4890173</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1146924000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-73/events/4890173/</event_url></item>
