Check out my picture on the meetup site, so you will recognize me. I generally get there about an hour before the show and the group heads in for seats about 30 minutes before hand. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will snag a table by the windows at the top of the escalator and if it is downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, we gather after the movie just outside the room where it was shown to talk about the movie a bit and get a head count of those who would like to come out for drinks, munchies and lively conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: September 17, 2010 &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Screen Gems (Sony) &lt;br /&gt;Director: Will Gluck &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Bert V.
