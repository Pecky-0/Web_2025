Which one will show up...?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody does 60's revivalist psychedelia quite like BJM and their new album, Aufheben doesn't disappoint. Boston is the second to last stop on the tour and they have been mixing up the set list almost every show. Matt Hollywood and Joel are back so this will be a performance to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an early show at 6PM so I understand that not everyone will be able to "meet" before the show.  I will be at Rock Bottom Brewery at 5 pm.  This brewery is very close, just on Stuart St about a 5 minute walk away.  I look just like my profile picture, so I'm pretty easy to spot. I imagine there will be a line forming pretty early to get into the Royale, so if the group wants to just meet in line I'm fine with that also. Let me know in your comments below which pre show option you prefer.  I will blast out an email a day before the show with my contact info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there,&lt;/p&gt;
