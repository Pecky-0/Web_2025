Great chance to mix and mingle and get to know each other better as well as practice your Chinese with one another.     Read Further down for the party details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the below information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is the new year, we will celebrate with food and drinks. Please bring something to share with the group. If possible, say what type of food you will be bringing next to your name (Using Comment box) Ie: main dish, drinks, appetizer, dessert or snacks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will not go out to eat tonight, instead we will have dinner at BCNC, so people bring food and drinks to share.  If no time to cook or buy something in advance, there are many restaurants (to get take out) and the 88 Supermarket are nearby.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can all make it. We want to party and have fun and ring in the new year with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: (a member says that Mapquest directions are confusing)&lt;br /&gt;BCNC is at 38 Ash St., off of Oak St. between Washington St. and Harrison Ave.&lt;br /&gt;Oak St. is between Kneeland St. and Marginal Way (alongside the Turnpike)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest T stop is Orange Line New England Medical Center. &lt;br /&gt;Walk toward the South End (away from Chinatown) on Washington St and take the first left onto Oak St. The entrance to the building is in Ash St., the first small street on the left. There's a sign for BCNC- Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. Sign in at the front desk and ask for the Meetup conversation group.&lt;br /&gt;Parking is limited in the area, due to the theater district, but sometimes you can find spaces on the surrounding blocks.
