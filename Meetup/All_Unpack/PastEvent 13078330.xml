This time we'll be exploring Federal Hill and the West Side, perhaps as far as the Dexter Armory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will be rescheduled for rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teams will be formed to scavenge the area based on clue sheets that will be distributed at the start. Since this is a newcomers events, teams will be assigned just before the start. The search area will kept to within a 1 square mile to reduce or eliminate the need for cars roaming the city. Teams will be of 3-4 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The items to be &amp;quot;scavenged&amp;quot; will be a photo of the item described in the clue. Every team will need to have one digital camera or cell phone with camera built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's how the hunt will work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I've tried to keep the hunt area small enough that it can be walked. I expect that over the course of the hunt a team should walk 2-3 miles. It is up to you to drive, but I hope it isn't necessary. The hunt area encompasses about 1 square mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Parking: Parking is available on Atwells Street, Spruce Street and several other side streets nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Starting Location: Meet in the Park at the corner of Atwells and Sutton. (358 Atwells for the GPS inclined)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be there by 12:45. If you can, please arrive a little before 1pm so that teams can be assigned and the hunt can start as close to 1 as possible &lt;br /&gt;4. What to Bring:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a digital camera, please bring it, and any cables that you need to connect it to a computer. I need to be able to see the photos and verify that they are indeed of target items in the hunt. To that end, I'll have a computer with to do that. If you don't have a camera to bring, that's fine, Every team will have someone with a camera on it. &lt;br /&gt;Good Walking Shoes. &lt;br /&gt;Money, if you want to partake of refreshments along the way, or at our end location. Food will be available for order. &lt;br /&gt;A sense of adventure and willingness to meet new people. &lt;br /&gt;5. Basic Rules&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teams will be 3 to 5 people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each team will need a name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each team will need one camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;All scavenged items must be photographed on a single device. (eg: teams must stay together) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If necessary, teams will be randomly chosen at the start area to encourage socialization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scavenger Hunt ends at 4pm. If you haven't found the Finish location by 4:15, please call me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each item on the hunt will be worth a certain number of points, the team with the most points will win the adulation and applause of the other teams, and a free round on me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you become lost or need assistance, you will be able to call me during the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no time bonus for finishing early, nor penalty for finishing late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may not be possible to get a photo of all items. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic maps of the area will be provided that outline the search area and street grid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scavenger lists will be distributed once teams have been formed and had a moment to introduce themselves to each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the person with a computer bag and maybe a bicycle looking like he's waiting for Godot.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275846233000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270329500000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>West Side/Federal Hill Scavenger Hunt</name><id>13078330</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275756300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/13078330/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
