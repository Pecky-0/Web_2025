<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>From Jen Nedbalsky, curator and organizer of YOUTH PRODUCING CHANGE at the Human &lt;br /&gt;Rights Watch International Film Festival:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to be in touch to suggest a film screening for your members.  We have an incredible &lt;br /&gt;film screening and reception happening on Fri Jan 16, and we &lt;br /&gt;hope you can join us! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 78 minute film program includes 9 short films made by teens &lt;br /&gt;from around the world, as they document the human rights issues &lt;br /&gt;they themselves face. The films are uplifting, funny and &lt;br /&gt;thought provoking. They will inspire you and your members to &lt;br /&gt;make change in your communities. &lt;b&gt;We'll be bringing in &lt;br /&gt;filmmakers from Kentucky, Brooklyn and 2 from Boston for a Q&amp;amp;A &lt;br /&gt;and special reception to follow.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOUTH PRODUCING CHANGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A program of short films was directed and produced by youth &lt;br /&gt;from across the globe. Armed with digital cameras, computers, &lt;br /&gt;and their own boundless creativity, these young people bravely &lt;br /&gt;expose human rights issues faced by themselves and their &lt;br /&gt;communities. A question and answer session with youth &lt;br /&gt;filmmakers--followed by a free reception at the school of the &lt;br /&gt;Museum of Fine Arts--follows screening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Countdown&lt;/b&gt; by Rene Dongo (US, 2007, 6 min.) An artist hopes &lt;br /&gt;society can work to fill the empty space left by 9/11. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Women Empowerment&lt;/b&gt; by Bridges to Understanding (South Africa, &lt;br /&gt;2007, &lt;br /&gt;5 min.).

The impact of US immigration &lt;br /&gt;policies on families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Islands of the People&lt;/b&gt; by Atira Women's Resource Society &lt;br /&gt;students (Canada, 2007, 6 min.) A thirteen-year-old girl makes &lt;br /&gt;a commitment to learn the Haida language from her grandmother, &lt;br /&gt;one of the last living people who can speak, read, and write in &lt;br /&gt;Haida. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The True Cost of Coal&lt;/b&gt; by Appalachian Media Institute, Appalshop &lt;br /&gt;Inc. students (2007, 8 min.).

Come out to the MFA for what should be a most memorable collection of short films from the perspective of the children involved.  A Q and A with many of the directors should be fascinating, and an opportunity to speak with them, the curator of the films, and with each other at a reception at the Museum School of the Arts is an opportunity not to be missed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please get your tickets well in advance as programs such as these at the MFA tend to sell out with long stand-by lines.  Tickets can be purchased at &lt;a href="https://ev12.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=09%3AMFA%3AFL0116-1%3AFL0116-1%2C14992&amp;amp;linkID=mfab&amp;amp;url=https%3A//ev12.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventList%3FlinkID%3Dmfab" target="_blank"&gt;MFA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I highly suggest you take the T.  Parking at the MFA tends to be an oxymoron.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will hold up a Meetup Sign after the Q &amp;A to lead the way to the reception</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231194869000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>YOUTH PRODUCING CHANGE </name><id>9452466</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232146800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9452466/</event_url></item>
