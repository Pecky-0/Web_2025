Many of us have had the pleasure of following &lt;b&gt;Lidia Scher&lt;/b&gt;'s LOA-inspired journey as she aligns and &amp;quot;synchronizes &amp;quot; her various passions in her painting that invites healing and harmony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us next Friday, October 2, for the gala opening of Lidia's artshow.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The art showcased represent a new direction for the award-winning painter and sculptor. While Lidia’s work is widely represented in private and corporate collections, &lt;b&gt;the new series incorporates her years of experience in Feng Shui and spiritual healing techniques. She combines her highly skilled painting instincts with her ability to select appropriate spiritual mantras, prayers and phrases to an individual’s situation &lt;/b&gt; in layered, multi-level paintings to draw viewers into the art as they discover mirrors, glass, stones, and various reflective textures in large and small canvases and vertical surfaces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and experience how Lidia’s training and experience manages to create fine art that moves one emotionally, spiritually as well as intellectually.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gala Opening:  Friday, October 2nd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 6:00 PM – 9:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;(I'll be there between 6:45 - 8:45 pm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Chestnut Hill Chiropractic-180 Wells Ave-Suite 302-A, Newton, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healing Therapy’s tunes by Barbara Dolan with Rick Maure on piano&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artist Statement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lidiascherart.com/mbr_statement.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.lidiascher...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************************************************&lt;br /&gt;Then on to &lt;b&gt;Dancing the Night away at Dance Friday in Brookline.&lt;/b&gt;  Dance Friday is organized by The Dance Friday Community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Brookline Tai Chi Center&lt;br /&gt;1615 Beacon Street, Brookline&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dancefriday.org/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://dancefriday.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 8:00 - midnight&lt;br /&gt;(I'll be there at 9:15 pm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your investment of &amp;quot;pure fun&amp;quot;: &lt;br /&gt;sliding scale adults $12-$8, teens $4, and children under 12 free.
