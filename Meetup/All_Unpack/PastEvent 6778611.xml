Richard is the founder of &lt;a href="http://ae911truth.org" target="_blank"&gt;Architects and Engineers for 911 Truth&lt;/a&gt;. Come hear a professional interpretation and analysis of what did happen to the World Trade Center buildings. Richard is so convincing that you'll want to join his organization after you've seen his presentation. He's also coming to Keene on December 13th, so you'll have a chance to follow up with him in person then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/store.php" target="_blank"&gt;9/11: Blueprint for Truth; The Architecture of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; will be presented at the &lt;a href="http://www.gogreatbuffet.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Great Buffet, 1525 South Willow Street in Manchester&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, 29 November, 2007. This is across the street from the Mall of New Hampshire and down the hill in the plaza where Chuck E. Cheese and Staples are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come at 6:30 to meet and greet, gather a fine dinner from Tom's excellent dinner buffet and hear a few introductory remarks. We'll start the film screening at 7:00 sharp. We'll have discussion time after the viewing, including suggestions for the next viewing. We're planning to have viewings in Manchester every 3 weeks and as we get rolling, we'll also have viewings in Nashua, Concord and Barnstead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you there and hope you'll enjoy the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to check out &lt;a href="http://myspace.com/merrimackvalley911truth" target="_blank"&gt;our MySpace page&lt;/a&gt; for other video selections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can email suggestions to us at: MerrimackValley911Truth@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small optional donation of $5 is asked, but not required, to help finance the video library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;time=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;ttype=&amp;amp;q=1525+South+Willow+Street,+Manchester,+New-Hampshire&amp;amp;sll=42.952402,-71.455765&amp;amp;sspn=0.105791,0.138016&amp;amp;layer=t&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.955732,-71.436367&amp;amp;spn=0.006612,0.008626&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;om=1" target="_blank"&gt;Google Map&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From East or West:&lt;br /&gt;Take Rt.101 towards Manchester;&lt;br /&gt;Join I-293 on the south side of Manchester;&lt;br /&gt;Take Exit 1, South Willow Street.&lt;br /&gt;(continue below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the East:&lt;br /&gt;Left at the top of the ramp onto South Willow Street;&lt;br /&gt;get in the right lane;&lt;br /&gt;At the light for the Mall of New Hampshire (on the left), turn right onto Kaye Street.&lt;br /&gt;(continue below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the West:&lt;br /&gt;Right at the top of the ramp onto South Willow Street;&lt;br /&gt;stay in right lane;&lt;br /&gt;At the light for the Mall of New Hampshire (on the left), turn right onto Kaye Street.&lt;br /&gt;(continue below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the North:&lt;br /&gt;Come down I-293 and follow it around to the East (also will say to Rt. 101 East);&lt;br /&gt;Exit at Exit 1, South Willow Street;&lt;br /&gt;Right at the top of the ramp onto South Willow Street;&lt;br /&gt;stay in right lane;&lt;br /&gt;At the light for the Mall of New Hampshire (on the left), turn right onto Kaye Street.&lt;br /&gt;(continue below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the South:&lt;br /&gt;Come up the Everett Turnpike;&lt;br /&gt;Take the exit for I-293 East &amp;amp; Rt 101 East;&lt;br /&gt;Take exit 1, South Willow Street;&lt;br /&gt;Right at the top of the ramp onto South Willow Street;&lt;br /&gt;stay in right lane;&lt;br /&gt;At the light for the Mall of New Hampshire (on the left), turn right onto Kaye Street.&lt;br /&gt;(continue below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From in-town Manchester:&lt;br /&gt;Go down South Willow Street through the commercial jungle until you cross I-293;&lt;br /&gt;stay in the right lane;&lt;br /&gt;At the light for the Mall of New Hampshire (on the left), turn right onto Kaye Street.&lt;br /&gt;(continue below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From South Willow onto Kaye Street:&lt;br /&gt;Once you've turned onto Kaye Street and are going down the ramp into the plaza:&lt;br /&gt;(the turn will take you between signs for Staples &amp;amp; ToysRUs on the left and AutoFair on the right)&lt;br /&gt;Take the first left into the parking lot in front of the first building on the left.&lt;br /&gt;Park in front of the Great Buffet.&lt;br /&gt;Enter the restaurant and find a seat in the &amp;quot;party room&amp;quot; on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you've found a seat, you can go grab a plate and enjoy Tom's fine buffet!&lt;br /&gt;The waitress will take your drink order - The Great Buffet serves beer and wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have a few brief remarks and get the video going at 7:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEE YOU THERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeremy</member_name><member_id>3581956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196552123000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195599636000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>9/11: Blueprint for Truth; The Architecture of Destruction</name><id>6778611</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196379000000</time><rsvp_limit>52</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/6778611/</event_url></item>
