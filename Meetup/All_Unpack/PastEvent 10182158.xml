Moosilaukee via the Glencliff Trail and Moosilauke Carriage Road to the summit of Mt. Moosilauke.  The total distance covered is 7.8 miles and should take approximately 7:00 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail runs from High St. (formerly Sanatorium Rd.) to the Moosilauke Carriage Rd. in a sag just north of Moosilaukeâ€™s South Peak. It is part of the AT. There is only one steep section, and the footing is generally good. The trailhead parking area is on the right a short distance past the trail sign; from here, one may follow an old farm road past a gate.  The upper part is above the treeline and greatly exposed to the elements, so it can be dangerous in bad weather. The lower part, up to a barricade, receives heavy snowmobile use in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering this a winter hike and foot traction is required.  No cotton clothing is allowed.  Please know your abilities and limits prior to signing up.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All participants are required to read and agree to the waiver and liability waiver posted on this site.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>DIANNE AND I WILL BE IN A BLACK FOUR DOOR ECHO</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240334081000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239717833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MT MOOSILAUKE</name><id>10182158</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240059600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/10182158/</event_url></item>
