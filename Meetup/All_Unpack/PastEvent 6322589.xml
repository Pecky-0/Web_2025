<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I had lots of people express interest in walking/hiking with our dogs! I thought our first dog walk should be an easy walk  so our dogs can get to know each other. Sessions Woods does require all dogs to be leashed and under control at all times! PLEASE no aggressive dogs!! Many members have expressed concern over other dog groups allowing aggressive dogs and careless owners. This walk is to be enjoyed by all so please know your dog!  &lt;br /&gt;  Sessions Woods has several trails available but I will be sticking to the main trail of dirt and gravel. It is a 2.6 mile route that is fairly easy but does have a couple of hills and a waterfall! There is also a beaver pond and stream running through the park. &lt;br /&gt;   All dogs MUST be up to date on all vaccines and owners must take responsibility for their dogs actions!! Again...NO AGGRESSIVE DOGS! &lt;br /&gt;   Please bring your own poop bags and clean up after your dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:Sessions Woods is located on rt.69-3 miles south of rt.4 in Burlington and 3 miles north of rt.6 in Bristol. Check with Mapquest if you have any problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this hike is AnnMarie (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2835202/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so please direct questions to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190041448000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189301134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hiking goes to the dogs-Sessions Woods</name><id>6322589</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189868400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/6322589/</event_url></item>
