Bring your sense of humor, your skill--&lt;i&gt;if you have any&lt;/i&gt;--and a little bit of luck to this very laid-back event where you can catch up with old friends, make new ones, impress everyone with your pool prowess (or &lt;i&gt;not!&lt;/i&gt;) and just be yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first hour is given over to meeting and eating (FTJ's is a &lt;i&gt;pool hall,&lt;/i&gt; so don't expect much more than solid fare for short bucks). Afterward, we'll head to the back of the room to play pool, drink beer and hang out. We'll have 3 pool tables reserved for 2 hours (8-10pm). There are two very comfy couches and a variety of stools along the side walls for seating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to four players per table means that as many as 12 people can be playing pool while others cheer them on and mingle. There are also pinball machines and dart boards on the other side of the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Remember, what really doesn't matter:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;you haven't played pool in, like, &lt;i&gt;forever!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;you suck at pool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;you're a vegetarian, or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;you don't drink beer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just come to hang-out and have fun! Or, you can take a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbmNcYH52eo" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;quickie lesson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and bring your beginner's luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at Flat Top Johnny's!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what &lt;i&gt;The Boston Phoenix's&lt;/i&gt; &amp;quot;Best 2010 Readers' Picks&amp;quot; has to say about &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/phoenix2010" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flat Top Johnny's&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EVENT FAQs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there a cover charge for Flat Top Johnny's?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there a minimum I need to spend on food and drinks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, but you'll be responsible for your own tab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I have to eat at FTJ's?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. In fact, you don't have to eat at all! If you just want to play pool, we'll start at 8pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much does it cost to play?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tables are $12/hour, so the total cost for the evening will be $72. If you play, you'll split this cost with everyone else--$3-$6, depending on the number of &lt;i&gt;players.&lt;/i&gt; If you don't play, you don't split anything. We'll settle up at 10pm, or you can give your share to Anor before you leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;How long can we stay?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including dinner, the entire event is 3 hours, from 7:00-10pm ... &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; ... you can stay as long as you'd like to afterward. You'll just have to pay for your own table at that point. FTJ's closes at 1am on Saturdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's the closest T-stop?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kendall Sq/MIT on the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Red Line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and about a 15 min walk from the station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about parking?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are metered spots on the surrounding streets (free after 6pm); or you can park in the garage next to the Landmark Kendall Sq Theatre (FTJ's will validate, so bring your ticket and you'll pay about $5).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about the weather?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event runs rain or shine!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>An Or</member_name><member_id>8593359</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287408970000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284744359000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rack 'em up @ Flat Top Johnny's!</name><id>14804830</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287270000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/14804830/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/2/1/global_14676801.jpeg</photo_url></item>
