Even if you think you're no good at trivia, you'll probably know something the rest of us don't, join us!  The competition is getting better, we need your trivia skills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trivia game starts at 9PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New this week, I will be taking photos of the teams.  Our group, for having existed for over a year has no photos...lets fix that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a new request.  Please don't RSVP Maybe, only RSVP Yes if you are sure that you can make it.  Setting yourself as maybe still takes up an attendance slot and I've had some instances where people were interested in coming but the event was showing as full.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be carrying a bike helmet and a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218673883000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Great conversation, fun people, a fun game, good music</why><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217696414000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Trivia @ Fatty McGees</name><id>8462039</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218501000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/8462039/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
