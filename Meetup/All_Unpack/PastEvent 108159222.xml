Set up is from 9:30-10a, the event runs from 10a-1p and then she'll need help with clean up until about 1:30pm. Protectors of Animals will be on hand and will load up what they'll need from us and the rest will go to Human Services to help the elderly that need assistance with food for their pets. Help is needed as greeters to pass out flyers, acceptors and thankers for the donations, people to keep track and organize supplies and loaders and unloaders of cars. We tend to have drive ups from people that see it in the papers and their pets have passed away and they give us their food and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Jaycees banner on a table outside the store</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carolyn</member_name><member_id>4983008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365872658000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1362695068000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pet Food Drive</name><id>108159222</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365861600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/108159222/</event_url></item>
