<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We had a great meetup on April 11th, in which new group members shared and got to know each other. We ended the evening with a guided meditation, which everyone felt very moved by. Since everyone is interested in continuing with the group meditation, and since most people are interested in learning more about how to meditate, I am offering a 4-class series on meditation for spiritual development. We will begin each class with a guided meditation exercise, similar to what we did in the first meetup, and then we will have a discussion about a topic related to meditation and spirituality, with readings selected from spiritual texts from major world religions. The class will meet every other week. Class #1 will be on Wednesday April 25 at 7:30pm, and subsequent classes will meet on Monday evenings at 7:30: May 7, May 21, and June 4. New members are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
