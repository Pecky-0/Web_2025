&lt;p&gt;We have tennis players of many levels, so come out if you are at all interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.  The courts are right next to some fields with several soccer goals, and we've been thinking of playing some quick pickup games here with whoever is around (Yes we've played soccer with little kids here, and they beat us silly) :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this recurring event will always be cancelled by actual rain.  If the forecast is rain, we might still be there if we can get in a few games/sets before the rain.  So PLEASE RSVP if you are coming, and watch the comments for cancellations.  TIA&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in the tennis courts behind the Moses Brown Physical Plant building.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8642703</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raghav</member_name><member_id>8758485</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345907694000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342404324000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play Tennis</name><id>qnqfddyqlbhc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345896000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/73496502/</event_url></item>
