Go climbing, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. CALL METROROCK AHEAD OF TIME. I asked if they had special hours on Friday. As of right now, they are open their normal hours, though the girl specified that they didn't have anyone scheduled, yet, to work. Translation: call ahead, to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you do not immediately see me (the girl in the green t-shirt with the shamrock), then look for the dry erase board. Rami will be there at 6 definitely, and he will describe what he is wearing on the board (it's by the bathrooms). I SHOULD be there at 6, but I am slated to pick up a friend at the airport at 4 p.m. It's a holiday week. In Logan Airport terms, as you all know, that means the plane can arrive anywhere between 4 and 10 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climb on!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerri :) &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196031699000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195572600000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Black Friday Meetup!!!! </name><id>6776262</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195858800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/6776262/</event_url></item>
