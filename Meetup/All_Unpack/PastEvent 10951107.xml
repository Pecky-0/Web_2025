<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Revere Beach.....conjures up images of grit, high-rise apartments, bars, clam shacks, and the legendary Kelly's Roast Beef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here's the new Revere Beach:  clean, wide and - several blocks away - a block of Cambodian grocers, and restaurants that look and feels like a city scene in Phnom Penh.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Blue Line T and start the afternoon hanging at the beach and follow up with an early Sunday dinner (as in grandma early -- 5:30) at Floating Rock, a family operation owned by Mouy Kim.  It's not a place frequented by many Americans which is not surprising given Floating Rock's tucked-away location, its size (28 seats), and odd hours -- the restaurant closes at 7 p.m. daily.  The interior and exterior are bland. But the food is anything but.  Come for Tiger Tears (small pieces of beef, green and red peppers, red onions, lemongrass, mint, hot and sour fish sauce, and roasted ground rice that adds a crunchy texture), loc lac and noodles.  And, if you're feeling timid, there are safe choices, including chicken chow foon and chicken with ginger.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Recession special:  Expect to pay $15 or under for the whole meal, tax and tip.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floating Rock doesn't have a liquor license, and doesn't serve dessert.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250788966000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248467057000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revere Beach followed by dinner the area's best Cambodian restaurant</name><id>10951107</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250442000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10951107/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/8/global_9836520.jpeg</photo_url></item>
