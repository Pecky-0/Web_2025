The owner's play a nice mix of music from the 70's and 80's. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday's they offer $5.00 Stoli Drinks along with $5.00 small plates...though there is nothing small about them!!! Their Crabmeat Stuffed Mushrooms are to die for, as are the Gourmet Nachos covered in Italian sausage, Gorgonzola, mozzarella, cheddar, and hot peppers; Spicy Peel and Eat shrimp,three different types of wings, I could go and on...enough to say that the food and drink are great! The atmosphere delightful and the owners attentive and fun!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please joins us for the small plates and then stick around as we are joined by PartyExpress at 8:00 pm  for Karaoke!!! It promises to be a great evening!!!! &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the folks having fun!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacey</member_name><member_id>7637795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272462888000</updated><rating><average>4.92000007629</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>32</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269206334000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Olde School Saloon and Bistro - Encore Performance</name><id>12948985</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271196000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/12948985/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
