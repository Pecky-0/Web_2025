Bring your snowshoes... if you don't have any and would like to try snowshoeing there will be about 20 pairs available for our use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring food if you'd like - we can make an afternoon of it. If you plan on bringing food, please post &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; on the meetup page... just in case we're all thinking of the same comfort food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/messages/boards/thread/6123382"&gt;message board&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it easier to take 101 to 101A, cross streets Wilson and Frye's Mill Road. Coming from Manchester or Nashua you pass the Monadnock Water and the storage units on the left on 101 A and then you will see a Mobile gas station on the left. Directly across the street from the Mobile take that right up the steep hill, that is Frye's Mill RD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the top of the hill at the first place the road splits, go right onto Wilson and take a quick right into the parking lot. You will see a green dumpster in the lot so you know you have the right place. Walk down to the side door marked with a sign &amp;quot;Lodge&amp;quot; it will be open. If you see the &amp;quot;Playhouse&amp;quot; you have gone too far up the hill. My number is 603-475-3351 in case anyone gets lost. ~ Gabriella&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOOD LIST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soup and Cornbread = Gaby &lt;br /&gt;Mini Quiche = Carolyn &lt;br /&gt;Potato Casserole = Liz&lt;br /&gt;Hot Chocolate = Liz&lt;br /&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Mushroon in sauce = Christine &lt;br /&gt;Vanilla/Vanilla Birthday Cake = Judi &amp;amp; Plunk&lt;br /&gt;Salad = Barbara&lt;br /&gt;Meatballs = Joan&lt;br /&gt;Chop Suey = Dave&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4894798</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judi-Judi-Judi</member_name><member_id>7477606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233608491000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232678267000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wilton Wilderness, Snowshoeing &amp; Pot Luck - Celebrating Joan's Birthday</name><id>9582598</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233421200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/9582598/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/f/a/global_7035066.jpeg</photo_url></item>
