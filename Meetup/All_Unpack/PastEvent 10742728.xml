Let's hope we catch a break, and hit the beach for an evening stroll. I can't think of a better way to unwind after work, and get ready for the long, holiday weekend then a walk on the beach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, we'll meet at the picnic tables by the pine trees in the West Beach parking lot. Drive into the park, bear right at the fork, and follow the sign to West Beach. We park in the farthest parking lot on the left, in front of the pavillions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested, we can go to Chip's Pub afterward for a drink and/or dinner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247418304000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246044842000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Take a Walk...</name><id>10742728</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246572000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/10742728/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/4/global_8618804.jpeg</photo_url></item>
