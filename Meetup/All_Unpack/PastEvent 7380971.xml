Constantly looking for authentic, heartfelt sounds, Borges digests the sounds around her and then delivers them anew in her own distinctive and unique style, full of country power and alt rock.&lt;br /&gt;Didn't see a cover charge listed for this one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/borgesrocks" target="_blank"&gt;Listen to Sarah Borges and the Broken Hearts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope some of you can make this meetup &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer can provide cell number to members that would like it.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg D</member_name><member_id>4879355</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207533157000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Why Not?</why><group><who>Fans of Live Music</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-live-music</urlname><id>444171</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Live Music</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203632636000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sarah Borges @ Johnny D's</name><id>7380971</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207359900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-live-music/events/7380971/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/a/b/global_3290731.jpeg</photo_url></item>
