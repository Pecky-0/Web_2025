See the description below.  The Kendall theater website has it starting at 6:30, which will give us plenty of time to get to the fireworks by 10:15.    If others would like to meet for dinner ahead of time at 5:15 at Tommy Doyle's, let me know and I'll organize it.  Otherwise, see you in the middle of the theater at 6:20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I've had trouble with movies selling out.  I can't imagine that this one will, but I'm going to buy my ticket ahead of time just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Theatre Des Champs-Elysées in Paris, Igor Stravinsky (Mads Mikkelsen, Flame and Citron) premieres his ballet The Rite Of Spring. Coco Chanel (Anna Mouglalis) attends the premiere and is mesmerized. But the revolutionary work is too modern, too radical: the enraged audience boos and jeers, and a near riot ensues. Stravinsky is inconsolable. Seven years later, now rich, respected and successful, Coco Chanel meets Stravinsky again—a penniless refugee living in exile in Paris after the Russian Revolution. The attraction between them is immediate and electric. Coco offers Stravinsky the use of her villa in Garches so that he will be able to work, and he moves in straight away, with his children and consumptive wife. And so a passionate, intense love affair between two creative giants begins.
