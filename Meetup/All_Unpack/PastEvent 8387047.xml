<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A very easy and lovely fairly level 2-3 mile hike at the Belding Trout Management Area in Vernon. This 2 hour long hike is very pleasent and is great for beginners and is scenic enough with the forest, stream, and dammed pond to interest more advanced hikers. We'll hike as much as we can in the 2 hours we have. This area is a hidden gem and even connects to Valley Falls, the Hop River Linear Trail, the Schinipsit Trail, and some Northern Connecticut Land trust property! How's that for location? Dogs and kids welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at trailhead parking but this can be somewhat limited depending on the number of attendees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for the Hartford area: &lt;br /&gt;* I-84 East to Exit 66&lt;br /&gt;* Turn left off the exit and left again at the light. &lt;br /&gt;* Cross over the highway and at the next light, turn right onto Route 30 East. &lt;br /&gt;* Follow Route 30 East to the 7-11 on the left at corner w/Vernon Ave. (meet-up location).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Northeastern CT:&lt;br /&gt;* I-84 West to exit 66&lt;br /&gt;* Turn right off the exit and left at the intersection.&lt;br /&gt;* At the next light, turn right onto Route 30 East. &lt;br /&gt;* Follow Route 30 East to the 7-11 on the left at corner w/Vernon Ave. (meet-up location).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions to trailhead parking for hike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=99+Tamarac+ln&amp;amp;city=vernon&amp;amp;state=ct" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topographical map of the area via Google Maps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=99%2BTamarac%2Bln,+vernon,+ct&amp;amp;sll=41.445493,-73.069468&amp;amp;sspn=0.018561,0.031929&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.839578,-72.446465&amp;amp;spn=0.018448,0.031929&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/photos/84966/513251/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so please direct any questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
