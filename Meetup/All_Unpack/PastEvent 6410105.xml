I've already started it, and it's a really dazzling book. Very good, and I think we'll get some very good discussion out of it. We can probably count on it being chilly and dark on this date, so I'll look for somewhere bright and indoors. &lt;br /&gt;For anyone new to 20s and 30s Book Club, we're still a young organization--everyone here is still meeting and getting to know each other, so don't be a stranger. Come to the discussion even if you haven't read the book (You can cheat and rent the movie at the very least)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cathy</member_name><member_id>4263429</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193180791000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190499348000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brookline Meetup</name><id>6410105</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193007600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/6410105/</event_url></item>
