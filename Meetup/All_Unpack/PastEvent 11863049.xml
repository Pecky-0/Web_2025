He wields his badge as often as he wields his gun in order to get his way. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina he becomes a high-functioning addict who is a deeply intuitive, fearless detective reigning over the beautiful ruins of New Orleans with authority and abandon. Complicating his tumultuous life is the prostitute he loves (played by Eva Mendes). Together they descend into their own world marked by desire, compulsion and conscience. The result is a singular masterpiece of filmmaking: equally sad and manically humorous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.badlt.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bad Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (2009) -92 % Tomatometer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The offbeat combo of director Werner Herzog and star Nicolas Cage (unleashed in one of his best performances), should make for potent box office in this story of a drug addicted, anything-goes cop who gets wrapped up in a case involving Senegalese illegals and an underground drug murder. This commercially potent movie is getting exposed using the same strategy typical for a fledgling prestige piece; it’s following the fall festival routes with stops in Venice, Telluride and Toronto. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the film, John will be standing in the aisle holding a Meetup Sign that might be pathetic, but might also be a new homemade version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go to an area restaurant (Doyle's?  CBC?  Friendly Toast?) for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258074456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans</name><id>11863049</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259441100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/11863049/</event_url></item>
