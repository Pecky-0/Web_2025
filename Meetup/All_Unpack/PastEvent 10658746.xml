When we can open our hearts to another's suffering, something changes in us. The Tibetan Buddhists have a practice called tonglin where we take our own suffering and transform it through compassion. In this practice, we breathe in another person's suffering, and as we breathe out, we send loving kindness, compassion, and healing, very similar to meta meditation. This is spirituality in the truest sense of the word, connecting to others beyond ourselves with an open mind and an open heart. Here is a nice article on the practice: &lt;a href="http://www.innerself.com/Meditation/weiss_andrew_60604.htm" target="_blank"&gt;compassion and tonglin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us as we discuss aspects of compassion and how it can help transform our spiritual practice. I have a recording by Jack Kornfield that includes a guided meditation we can listen to, and as always, we will have a short silent meditation as well. All meditation and mindfulness experience levels are welcome. We'd love to see you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TomC, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting people at the door until about 6:05pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248735475000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245108742000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Meetup: Compassion</name><id>10658746</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248127200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/10658746/</event_url></item>
