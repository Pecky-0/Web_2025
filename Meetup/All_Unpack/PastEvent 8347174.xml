Then we'll go in and buy our tix and goodies and choose our seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't already RSVPed, please do so I know who to wait for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's go see a truly 3-D movie, from beginning to end! Brendan Fraser is a superhero this summer w/ the Mummy 3 and Journey. We have to wait a bit for Mummy, but we can relive the classic Jules Verne story on July 24!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll update the time next week, as showtimes don't come out this far ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet outside the theater before the show and I'll buy our discounted tickets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring friends! Just be sure to include them in your RSVP so I know how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll hit Friday's or somewhere of similar ilk after the show, if everyone's up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be outside the theater waiting for you!
