We will post gear recommendations the week before the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a loop hike up to Mount Major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * From the back, left-hand corner of the parking lot, get onto the snowmobile trail which quickly crosses a wooden bridge.&lt;br /&gt;    * After about 0.4 mile on the snowmobile trail, turn right onto Boulder Loop which starts to climb.&lt;br /&gt;    * Boulder Loop climbs easily at first then gets steeper as it winds amongst ledge and boulders. After a final steep pitch, you will reach semi-open ledges (where the trail curves to the left) with views and much easier inclines.&lt;br /&gt;    * After 1.4 miles on Boulder Loop, you will reach the summit of Mount Major.&lt;br /&gt;    * Descend by walking away from the view (in a westerly direction) to get onto Brook Trail.&lt;br /&gt;    * Follow Brook Trail, keeping to the right as you pass two trail junctions on the upper part of the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;    * Brook Trail will flow straight into Mount Major Trail/Main Trail which will return you to the parking lot, 2.4 miles from the summit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead: Parking lot is on the left hand side or Route 11 just 4.2 miles north of the town of Alton Bay. There is a sign on route 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailhead is on the back right side of the parking lot if you are facing the mountain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can find a place to get a sandwich after the hike.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236524447000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235163658000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MT MAJOR   ALTON BAY, NH </name><id>9785486</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235919600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9785486/</event_url></item>
