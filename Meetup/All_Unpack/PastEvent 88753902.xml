So please join me for aÂ  4.0 mile trail run starting and ending at Walden Pond. The route begins along the pond shoreline. About halfway around the pond we will cross the railroad tracks into Lincoln woods. We'll run on multiple trails on a nice loop and finish back where we started from on the pond loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trails are fairly level with limited rocks and roots and the pace will be approximately 9 min/per mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer we included a swim after the run and although it will be November I did see a few people swimming in the pond today (Oct 26th). So if it's nice, let's go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parking fee at the reservation is $5. There are also places to park at Concord high school (across RT 2). It's about a half mile away from the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We'll meet in front of the gift shop (which is next to the parking lots on Rt 126)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in front of the gift shop.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>4878639</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352072524000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351303094000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walden Pond Run/Maybe Swim</name><id>88753902</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352037600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/88753902/</event_url></item>
