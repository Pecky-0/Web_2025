Here is the synopsis for &lt;u&gt;A Prayer for Owen Meany&lt;/u&gt; from Barnes and Noble:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;John Irving’s &lt;u&gt;A Prayer for Owen Meany&lt;/u&gt; is the inspiring modern classic that introduced two of the author’s most unforgettable characters, boys bonded forever in childhood: the stunted Owen Meany, whose life is touched by God, and the orphaned Johnny Wheelwright, whose life is touched by Owen. From the accident that links them to the mystery that follows them–and the martyrdom that parts them–the events of their lives form a tapestry of fate and faith in a novel that is Irving at his irresistible best.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;Free Copy Link Removed  ...  It was a pirated copy.  Sorry!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Lamothe, one of the organizers, was kind enough to bring everyone who attended this evening a new copy of &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/books/product.aspx?EAN=9780618812677&amp;amp;box=97806188126&amp;amp;pos=-1&amp;amp;ugrp=1" target="_blank"&gt;The Best American Mystery Stories - 2008&lt;/a&gt; from the Best American Series.  If you have time, please add this book to your reading assignment as we plan on discussing this book as well.  Thanks Bob!  That was a wonderful Christmas present!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a local Portsmouth author was with us this evening discussing his new published work, &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Violence-Veils-and-Bloodlines/Louis-J-Salome/e/9780786446599/?itm=1&amp;amp;USRI=violence+veils+and+bloodlines" target="_blank"&gt;Violence, Veils and Bloodlines&lt;/a&gt; by Louis J. Salome.  He gave a compelling account of his new novel and I encourage everyone to support your local authors and pick up a copy of his book!  Here is a synopsis from Barnes and Noble:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;This memoir by an American journalist explores how entrenched notions of self, family, and tribalism dictate human behavior in our modern world. Salome's work as a foreign correspondent, reporting from such places as Belfast, Kabul, Bosnia, and Somalia, provided him with a unique perspective on the role nationalism and tribalism play in global conflicts.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!  I look forward to seeing you all next year!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask the bartender or hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob Lamothe</member_name><member_id>6364190</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>7202411</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Craig</member_name><member_id>8977543</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295543559000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portsmouth-Book-Club</urlname><id>1147811</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292386488000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portsmouth Book Club January Meetup - A Prayer for Owen Meany</name><id>wnvlpypcbpb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294790400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portsmouth-Book-Club/events/15738223/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/e/6/global_20270022.jpeg</photo_url></item>
