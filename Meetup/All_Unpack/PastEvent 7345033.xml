<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Meet inside the TD BankNorth Garden commuter rail station in front of the donut shop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will walk along the Rose Kennedy greenway from North Station to Chinatown and see how much of the Greenway has been completed. To walk for a good 2 hours we will likely have to take a tour of the South End also. Either way we will end up at the Empire Garden restaurant in Chinatown to have yummy dim sum. You can also order from the menu if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are arriving by T, you must go to North Station, exit to the street, then enter the TD BankNorth Garden commuter rail station.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204571190000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203206374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rose Kennedy Greenway walk &amp; Dim Sum</name><id>7345033</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204398000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7345033/</event_url></item>
