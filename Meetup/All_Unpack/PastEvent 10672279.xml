<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have mapped out a 6 mile route along the Charles similar to last week's 7.5 mile run. The group that met up last week ran around a 9 1/2 minute mile pace, so if that works for you, please attend. The more people we have, the more we can accommodate people who want to run a little faster or a little slower. I picked this location because it has plenty of parking and it's pretty close to the running path. There is also one water fountain along the route. (Actually there are two, but one isn't working...arrgh.) Though this week's run is a step backward (in terms of mileage), the goal is to use this meetup time for longer training runs. (For example, next week, according to my Marine Corps Marathon training schedule, I should be doing a 9 mile run. Please don't make me run that alone.) In any event, please attend. As they say, the more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Panera Bread at Arsenal on the Charles</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>heidi</member_name><member_id>8485896</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245705768000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245252784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Morning Run Along the Charles</name><id>10672279</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245502800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10672279/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
