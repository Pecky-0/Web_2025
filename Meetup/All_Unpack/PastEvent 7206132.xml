The agency offers year-round adaptive outdoor recreation programs for people with disabilities and thier families and friends.  Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, kick sledding, ice skating, and sled skating.  The purpose of this training is to get us comfortable with outdoor activities and it will also cover general disability awareness.  I think it is a great way for us to get together and give back to others.  The nice thing about it is that we will have fun and feel good about what we are doing at the same time.  For more info you can contact Sue at (413)527-8980 or go to the website www.alloutadventures.org.  I have made Sue aware of our group and our intention to post a volunteer activity with this agency on our Single Mingle site at least once a month.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202220335000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201452013000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>All Out Adventures Training</name><id>7206132</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202047200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/7206132/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/6/b/global_2890459.jpeg</photo_url></item>
