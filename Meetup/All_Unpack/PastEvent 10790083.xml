According to my training schedule, I'm supposed to do a 10 mile run this weekend, but that's not going to happen. So, if any of you would like to join me for a leisurely (9.5 minute per mile pace) run, or, if this weather keeps up, backstroke along the Charles, let me know. I am open on the distance; we can do just 6 or we can do 8. We'll start at Panera Bread in Watertown at Arsenal on the Charles and figure it out from there.  Please only rsvp if you are a &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Maybe.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in front of Panera</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>heidi</member_name><member_id>8485896</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246915074000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246559362000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Morning 6 to 8 Mile Run Along the Charles</name><id>10790083</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246712400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10790083/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
