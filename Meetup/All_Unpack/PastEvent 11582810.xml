Two more official winter 4000 ft summits for your NH 48 list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry Peck will be hosting this hike and plans to be a bit different, go counter-clockwise around the loop.  Starting at the Hancock Notch trail head, he  plans on taking the Hancock Notch trail to the Cedar Brook trail, to the Hancock loop trail, and return&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This round trip loop is 9.8 miles, 7.2 of which are relatively flat, only 2,940 feet of elevation gain, in 7.0 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late Fall conditions are in effect. Dress in synthetic layers and pack a change of clothing should your clothes get wet.  Pack water and food for 9 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike starts out on a flat, easy walk on the Hancock Notch, Cedar Brook, &amp;amp; Hancock Loop Trails to the base of the range, then a moderate climb for .7 mile up to the ridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/8/9/7/event_1274487.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are spectacular views from both North &amp;amp; South peaks and along the Ridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hancock Loop Trail is the only trail to Mount Hancock, a 4000-footer at the edge of the Pemigewasset Wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos2.meetup.." target="_blank"&gt;http://photos2.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;It starts with old woods roads to the loop junction, climbs steeply to the N or S peak depending on which fork you took, then follows a wandering path along the ridge to the other peak before descending back to the loop junction. The route up the N peak is rougher and steeper so we plan to go up that way and down the slightly-better route from the S peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:Hancock Outlook, Lincoln , NH 03251&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions take I-93 Exit 32 at Lincoln and go E on NH Route 112 (Kancamagus Highway) about 11 miles to Hancock Notch Trail. There is a notable hairpin turn on the highway and the parking lot is right after the turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second hike option: A second light hike group can be formed for a intermediate level hike of the beautiful Hancock Notch Trail. This hike is suitable for beginner and intermediate hikers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Families are welcome&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255438537000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255032007000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North and South Hancock Mountain </name><id>11582810</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255265100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11582810/</event_url></item>
