We can skate for an hour or two and then either get something to eat at Chau Chow City in Chinatown or go see a movie at the AMC Boston Common.  You can let me know your preference when you RSVP.  Admission is $4.00 and if you don't have your own skates, $8.00 to rent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI the Frog Pond (www.bostoncommonfrogpond.org) isn't actually a pond for those of you who don't know.  It's just an outdoor rink that's frozen from underneath.  I know some people don't skate on ponds for fear of ruining their blades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This location is T accessible by Park Street on the red and green lines.  If you are driving you can pay to park at the Boston Common Garage or park on the street for free as the meters are shut off on Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm giving the option to RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot;.  Please update your RSVP if your plans change.  I'll also be combining this event with the Social Fun group too.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will meet at the Frog Statues.
