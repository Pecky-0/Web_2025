<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;This is a dual meetup with &lt;a href="http://beer.meetup.com/194/"&gt;The Waltham Beer Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt; AND the &lt;a href="http://redsox.meetup.com/158/"&gt;Red Sox Natives Meetup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  Yeehaw! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sox are taking on the Yanks in the first of a 2-game series in the Bronx... and the Celtics game might be on as well, since it's their last home game of the season.  The Mad Raven has a bunch of TV's and as a bonus, a large pull down screen in the middle of the room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've got a bunch of locals from the Waltham area coming to meetup, so let's make this a great dual event.  Please email me if you have any questions, and looking forward to seeing you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll probably wear a Sox hat!  Take a look at my picture - the bar is pretty small, so you should be able to find me there.  I can give out my cell number if that will help. :)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208558304000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>You'll get to watch a game, try a new place, and meet a bunch of new people from a nearby meetup group.
