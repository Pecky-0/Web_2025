Notably there will be a Mardi Gras Festival in Burlington that weekend put on by the Magic Hat Brewery - so, good times will be had for sure...    Here's the plan:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, February 26th - Drive up in morning and Ski STRATTON Mtn - Note:  For those of you w/ CT Ski Council passes lift tickets are only $32 for that Friday.   If you can't drive up Friday morning, then just meet us up there that evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lodging - &lt;a href="http://www.greenmontfarms.com/virtualTour.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.greenmontf...&lt;/a&gt;     Dorm style, converted barn, with kitchen.   Awesome - only $15 a night.     I stayed here a couple of weeks ago and it is truly unique and awesome.  It's only 10 min away from Smuggs and 25 from Burlington.   Dorm style sleeping arrangements - bring your sleeping bag!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, February 27th - We can split the group, if need be.  If you want to go skiing -  Smuggs is 10 min away from our lodging, or you can accompany me to the Magic Hat Mardi Gras Fest which is sure to be a fun time - parade starts at noon in downtown Burlington!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, February 28th - Skiing Smuggs All day, then driving home.
