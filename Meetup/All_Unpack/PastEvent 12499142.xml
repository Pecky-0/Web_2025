Departs from behind the Federal Reserve along the Fort Point Channel off Summer Street. Look for the Shuttle Sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Band Schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:30 – 7:00 PM Dicey Riley  (Celtic Rock and Irish Pub Songs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:30 – 8:00 PM Colum Cille Pipes &amp;amp; Drums  (Bagpipes &amp;amp; all) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:20 – 10:20 PM Joshua Tree  (Boston’s Premiere U2 Cover Band) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details:&lt;br /&gt;-Cover charge $20.00 and includes a souvenir Pint Cup and one (1) drink ticket (does not include food or additional beers)&lt;br /&gt;-Must be 21 or older and have proper I.D.&lt;br /&gt;-Cash bars serving a selection of fresh Harpoon beer for $5.00 per 16 oz. cup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:  FRIEND OF HARPOON FRIDAY NIGHT SPECIAL!&lt;/b&gt; Present your Friend of Harpoon Card, and you will receive HALF PRICE ADMISSION ($10 includes admission and one drink ticket)! You MUST have your Friend of Harpoon card to receive this price! If you don't have your Friend of Harpoon card, please request one on the Friend of Harpoon website.  And if you are not a Friend of Harpoon, you can sign up on the website as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's usually a coat check (a few $$) so you don't have to lug your coat, etc. around all night. Bathrooms are porta-potty's, so be prepared! Also, the food isn't THAT good, so eat something before hand or take a snack with you. There are a few food vendors inside south station if you want to grab something there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Like Susan, who has organized this event in the past, I recommend taking the T and leaving your car at home, especially if you're going to drink.  Some even say that the beer is stronger than normal, since it comes fresh from the brewery.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet between 5:30 and 6:00 outside Clarke's. Then we'll head over using the shuttle. Please RSVP by 3pm on March 5th so I know who to look for at Clarke's. Maybe's will be considered a &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; at that point. Thanks! :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268758255000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265143407000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harpoon St. Patrick's Festival 2010</name><id>12499142</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267828200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/12499142/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/3/6/global_12923430.jpeg</photo_url></item>
