Windsor starting at 8:45 AM and carpool from there. I'll be at Walmart earlier in case people want to get there earlier. I have a van and can seat up to 7 additional people. I already have 1 (maybe 2) people who have commited to carpool with me for this excursion. Directions from the Hartford area are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Take I-91 N. to EXIT 45 (CT-140, E. WINDSOR).&lt;br /&gt;2. Turn RIGHT onto CT-140 E.&lt;br /&gt;3. At stop light, turn RIGHT onto CT-5 S.&lt;br /&gt;4. Less than a mile on RIGHT you will see Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;5. Go down the drive to Walmart and we will meet up there and park car(s) to be left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will leave at about 9 AM from Walmart and drive the approximate 1 hr. to Holyoke Range SP. Arrival will be at approximately 10 AM at the parking area off of Bachelor St. at the south end of the park (see the image in a previous post on this thread from me).  Directions from the Wal-Mart are on the message board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will hike about 2 hr. and get back to the vehicles at about Noon. Then the plan is to head out to someplace (TBD) to eat lunch together in the area (likely S. Hadley area back down MA-116).  Kevin's cell phone number will be emailed to all those that RSVP for this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact Kevin with any questions, as he is the man with the plan for this one.  For more information, please see the website below or check out the link on the message board for this hike, titled &amp;quot;What about a Jan. 28th hike?&amp;quot;  If you are carpooling with Kevin to get there, please consider donating money towards gas.  This is paid directly to him, not through the paypal link on the website&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/hksp.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/hksp.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1137952810000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holyoke Range Hike</name><id>4838844</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1138456800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4838844/</event_url></item>
