You can take a belay test when you get there. If you have never climbed before, you should take a class at Metrorock. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements to take the class. You can use the message board on this meetup to find other people that want to take the class. The classes do fill up, so please call ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metrorock charges $16 ($14 with student ID) for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 10 pm we usually go for beer/pizza/etc., in Everett or Somerville 'cuz climbing works up an appetite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I'll be around the picnic table until about 7:15 pm, after that you'll have to come find me. I'll be wearing tan shorts, a black shirt, and glasses.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be by the picnic table wearing tan shorts, a black shirt, and glasses</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>4689439</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222904801000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222279618000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Night Climb</name><id>8824554</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222383600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8824554/</event_url></item>
