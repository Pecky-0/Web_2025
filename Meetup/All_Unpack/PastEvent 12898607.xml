Admission is $10 - or $5 for members of the Friends of Mount Auburn&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;... If there is a Nerd Fun Meetup event regarding history in the past year-and-a-half, you probably have seen Rob there. Perhaps at any event mentioning Poe. Or you may have run into him as part of the National Park Service at the Longfellow House. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be waiting wherever the tour begins, but 20 minutes early, just kicking around, assembling a group, &amp;quot;herding Nerds&amp;quot; as Heather our scruffy Nerd herder says. Feel free to join him! He'll find a more exact spot later. T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with blue eyes, short brown hair, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. The &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J. &amp;quot; nametag will not be worn, since he keeps getting mistaken as a tour guide at places such as this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Mt Auburn Cemetery:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mountauburn.org/national_landmark/history.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mountaubur...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Mount Auburn Cemetery has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the Department of the Interior, recognizing it as one of the country's most significant cultural landscapes. Founded in 1831, it was the first large-scale designed landscape open to the public in the United States. Today its beauty, historical associations and horticultural collections are internationally renowned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Our founders believed that burying and commemorating the dead was best done in a tranquil and beautiful natural setting at a short distance from the city center. They also believed that the Cemetery should be a place for the living, &amp;quot;embellishing&amp;quot; the natural landscape with ornamental plantings, monuments, fences, fountains and chapels. This inspired concept was copied widely throughout the United States, giving birth to the rural cemetery movement and the tradition of garden cemeteries. Their popularity led, in turn, to the establishment of America's public parks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;u&gt;Famous Residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Mount Auburn is the final resting place of thousands of distinguished people.
