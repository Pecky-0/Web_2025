<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Note: Our April swap was a bit too early to do significant plant swapping so let's aim for May.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Post in the comments area if you're looking for something in particular or have plants to bring...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please join us for the &lt;b&gt;Portland Trading Post&lt;/b&gt; monthly swap event, inspired by our friends in &lt;a href="http://www.somervilletradingpost.org/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Somerville &lt;/a&gt; - and the success of our recent plant and preserved food swaps!  Trading Post events are&lt;b&gt; free and open to all&lt;/b&gt;.  Space may be limited in our first few sessions while we work out the kinks, &lt;i&gt;so please take your RSVP seriously&lt;/i&gt;.  Plants, seedlings, seeds, preserved or fresh produce, hand-made items, etc. are all welcome at Portland Trading Post.  The main idea is that we are stepping outside of the cash economy and mutually &amp;quot;gifting&amp;quot; things to each other in a way that turns whatever we have in abundance into a diversity of goodness and good will.   &lt;b&gt;The only rules are:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;No cash changes hands (like anyone has any, anyway.) &lt;li&gt;Don't start the swapping until everyone's there and has a chance to look around at what's on offer. &lt;li&gt;You can swap with someone or simply &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; things to each other without taking a return item. Your choice. The IRS doesn't care about gifts, right? :) &lt;li&gt;Make sure you've found a home for all your stuff before you leave (or take home what hasn't been gifted). &lt;li&gt;If you bring a food item with multiple ingredients, pls label.  &lt;b&gt;Please use the comments area of this page to talk about what you might be bringing or seeking.&lt;/b&gt;  Potluck/Food/Snacks/Fiddles/Juggling optional.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Homa </member_name><member_id>2587064</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aaron Parker</member_name><member_id>6845673</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305672651000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289864841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Trading Post :: Monthly Swap Event (Plants!
