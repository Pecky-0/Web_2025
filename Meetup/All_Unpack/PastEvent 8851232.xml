We meet out front of the theater, but if it's too cold, we'll meet just inside the doors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP if you can come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809947151/info" target="_blank"&gt;Miracle at St. Anna&lt;/a&gt; seems to be one of those movies that just look and feel different on the big screen. So how about we get involved in the story together? Here's the synopsis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four soldiers from the army's Negro 92nd Division find themselves separated from their unit and behind enemy lines. Risking their lives for a country in which they are treated with less respect than the enemy they are fighting, they discover humanity in the small Tuscan village of St. Anna di Stazzema. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring guests, just be sure to include them in the RSVP. Discounted tickets are $8.50 for FMM members and their guests. Small popcorn and small drink tickets are $3 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cell: &lt;b&gt;508-308-4897&lt;/b&gt; in case you get late, get lost, or need direx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll head to TGI Fridays after to chat/snack/whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223839175000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222629172000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Miracle at St. Anna</name><id>8851232</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223508600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/8851232/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
