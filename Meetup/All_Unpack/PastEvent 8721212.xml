Come have a drink right after work and learn who all these cool girls are!  OM is a gorgeous lounge in the heart of Harvard Square (Red Line, Harvard Stop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll discover what everyone does for &lt;b&gt;work, play, hobbies, etc.&lt;/b&gt;  Let's find out if we have any connections to each other!  You never know who you will meet that may be able to help or give advice on anything from: job transitions, finding a class, dating, travel, music, career/opportunity networking, fun upcoming events, volunteering, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's really great to come together as women and help each other to move forward in any way that we can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to meeting everyone.  This event is free, although you will purchase your own beverages.&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Bernadette&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in the lounge/patio area, first floor - Bernadette cell: 617-372-3557</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222449858000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220972237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>1-Hour Networking at OM Lounge</name><id>8721212</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221861600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/8721212/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/d/5/global_5455749.jpeg</photo_url></item>
