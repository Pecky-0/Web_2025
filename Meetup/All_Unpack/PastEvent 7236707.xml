They are a cover band that plays a mix of songs and the shows are usually a lot of fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you missed the last show, you missed Lionel Ritchie, Shania Twain, upsidedown shots, and the singer taking pictures of his junk. Oh, and the usual swearing, drinking, and dancing. Don't forget to let us know if it is your birthday that night...you may get something a little special from the band... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 9 pm, and there are only 2 opening bands according to the Toad's website. Darik and the Funbags usually start playing around midnight. Tickets are $8.50 in advance, $10 at the door but you can usually find coupons for free admittance before 10/$5 after 10 around places in New Haven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** You can get tickets to get in free before 10 pm on the Darik website (below)...just go to their calender. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.toadsplace.com/calendar.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Toad's website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dfunbags.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Darik and the Funbags website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Andrea is the contact (Cell # 203-641-8083). I will get there between 10 and 10:30. We usually hang out in the back bar -- the one with the jungle theme -- until Darik starts playing. Then we'll be on the dance floor.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202850293000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201823193000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>DARIK &amp; THE FUNBAGS at Toad's Place 2/08</name><id>7236707</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202526000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/7236707/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/e/4/global_3164020.jpeg</photo_url></item>
