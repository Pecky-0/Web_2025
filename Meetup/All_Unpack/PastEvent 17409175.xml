It is a story whispered by the wind of Burning Man desert, secrets of the Vine and ancient city of Varanasi, one of the seven oldest cities on Earth. In this breathtaking interactive performance we meet humorous Ganesh, courageous Shiva, beautiful Parvati, wrathful Indra, shining Lakshmi, wise Sarawati and terrifying Kali .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year of 2012 is fast approaching, the&amp;nbsp;end game&amp;nbsp;of Kali Yuga. We are moving faster and faster now &amp;ndash; cruising through multiple relationships, treating our bodies like malleable plastic, changing our e-identities like gloves. We do not read past the first paragraph, if it is not instant we do not want it. We are burning resources of the world faster and faster. We have no time to catch up with our own breath. The speed is exciting but where exactly are we going? Are we going to higher consciousness or into the dead end? Is humanity doomed or there is hope? Brahma, the creator says that the only way to survive now is to get the nectar of immortality out of the polluted ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiva, the Hero of Our Times, the father of yoga and tantra is the only one who can drink the poison out of the ocean at Mount Meru and charm the snakes. His heart is broken, he has seen it all, alone he is sitting in meditation &amp;ndash; is he going to push himself to the limits once again for the sake of others? Can he withstand the scary visions which are coming up as he is drinking the ocean? Can he conquer the asuras &amp;ndash; the ever-changing, multiplying demons of fear and desire who want the nectar for themselves? They are the ones who are taking over as the end of Kali Yuga is approaching. People could not defeat them, Gods could not, great Mother Kali could not get them, what is glorious madman Shiva going to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching and participating in this play we are immersing ourselves into a deep meditation on our own qualities, qualities of the universe and human design. We are learning how to invoke these aspects of energy in us &amp;ndash; humor, compassion, courage, creativity, dedication though observing, dancing, singing and improvising. We will be learning how to transmute poison into nectar in our lives and in the life of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The play is written by Luba and the Tantra Without Borders Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-line $25; at the door $35&lt;/p&gt;
