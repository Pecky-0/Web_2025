Cultural Café, a new fundraiser for HI’s Cultural Kitchen program, will explore the world’s cuisines and cultures the first Tuesday of each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Le's Restaurant&lt;/b&gt; in bustling Allston Village is the December destination. Your dinner will include a full family-style meal of pho, Canh Chua (hot, sweet and sour soup), caramelized pork or fish, and other Vietnamese specialties. The staff at Le's will wear traditional Vietnamese dress and will demonstrate how to make fresh summer rolls, a favorite at their restaurant.  The restaurant is vegetarian-friendly; please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an afterschool activity, Cultural Kitchen teaches Boston and Somerville youth about culture and diversity using cooking as the primary vehicle - just like hostel travelers learn about one another while cooking together in the shared kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cultural Café provides an opportunity for community members to experience what students experience in the Cultural Kitchen program. The setting is informal as guests gather to build community, share a delicious meal, learn about another culture, and support a great cause!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP at &lt;a href="http://culturalcafedecember.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://culturalcafede...&lt;/a&gt; by November 25th for this affordable and fun event – space is limited. For more information or to rsvp directly, contact Karin Turer at 617-718-7990 ext 23 or kturer@usahostels.org. &lt;b&gt;Tickets must be paid for in advance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be at the large group table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259885514000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Culturalcafe</urlname><id>1554280</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Cultural Café - Dine Out for a Cause</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257803934000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cultural Café - Vietnamese food!
