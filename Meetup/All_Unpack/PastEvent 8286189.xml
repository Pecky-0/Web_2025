Field Day for Justice is going down today at 1pm near the Stony Brook T stop on the Orange line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're moving Field Day for Justice one block over to the field by New Minton Street due to the festival at the Stony Brook T field.  Just walk one block down Amory towards the tennis courts and you'll find us.  We'll be the ones having all kinds of fun with water balloons and orange cones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's included in Field Day, you ask? Oh, just an Egg Race, Balloon Toss, Sponge-Bucket Race, 3-Legged Race, and Tug of War! Other possibilities include: Parachute games, Blob Tag, Red Rover, Human Knot, and Crab Soccer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest up! Not only is it gonna be a scorcher, but some SoJusters have been known to be pretty fierce competitors! (Of course, it's all fun and games...)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hilary</member_name><member_id>3092728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216746797000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215363872000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Field Day for Justice</name><id>8286189</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216573200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/8286189/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/0/f/global_4697391.jpeg</photo_url></item>
