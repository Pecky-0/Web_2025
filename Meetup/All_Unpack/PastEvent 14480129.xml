The selected text for this first meeting is the Preface, the Introduction and Part One: Abstract Right. Please note that the text has numbered paragraphs. Under most of them are &amp;quot;Notes&amp;quot; which are lecture notes, and also in many cases there are sections called Additions, which may be incorporated within the text or at the end, depending upon what printing you have.   All of this material is interesting and worth reading, but if you don't have time to read the Additions, then skip over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text:&lt;br /&gt;There is a public domain earlier translation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/hegel/right.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;https://docs.google.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxford publishes: Outlines of the Philosophy of Rights (translator T.M.
