In the distance are trees and some small scenic buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO MEET: 3-3:30, Sandwich Coffee center on Jarvis Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: (from memory) Take route 3S, over the Sagamore bridge and take the exit to historic Sandwich/New Seabury. Take a left off the exit and follow straight about 3 miles into town. Sandwich center is small. You'll pass a pond on your left, a library on your right, and Jarvis street is the 1st or 2nd left thereafter. The coffee-shop is at the far end (1/4 mile) of Jarvis street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER:&lt;br /&gt;            RSVPs: It's best to let us know you are coming so we can look for you or alert you to any changes. &lt;br /&gt;            THINGS TO BRING WHICH ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN: &lt;br /&gt;                        Mosquito repellant,  Paper towels,  Sweater, water, food&lt;br /&gt;            IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call.&lt;br /&gt;            LAX: You have a half hour of leeway to meet us. After that we may leave without you.&lt;br /&gt;            INCLEMENT WEATHER: It is up to you to determine if the weather makes painting untenable. Although, I will try to leave a message on my voice mail if I myself do not intend to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541905000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186493511000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>OUTING ANNOUNCEMENT: Sandwich, MA</name><id>6138892</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186858800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/6138892/</event_url></item>
