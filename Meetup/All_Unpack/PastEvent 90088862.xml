 Please join Steve Ob1. and about 20 to 85 friends at our tables for an evening of dancing and socializing. This is the largest Singles Dances in NH, with between 200 and 400 singles, in a ballroom setting, not a Bar. Yet, it is not a ballroom dance. Meet and dance with the most tasteful variety of people and ages you will find anywhere. Because of the popularity of this Dance. Tables and seats are hard to hold, much past 8:30. Parking is also limited to only around 250 to 300 cars. So, bring your walking shoes. If you are late. Plus, the Cover Charge goes from $12 to $15 after 9 pm. Please get there before or as close to 8 pm as possible. So, you can meet some new people. Steve Ob1. will do his best to introduces you to everyone at our tables.. If you get there late? Introduction become very difficult. Because there is no one at out tables. Because they are all dancing. Also, as you pay at the door, ask where Steve Ob1., or meetup, are sitting. They will show you where our tables are. &lt;br /&gt;
