We're usually there for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is no event at the Garden, parking is $10 at the Government Center Garage.  Haymarket and Govt Center are the nearest MBTA stations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;/b&gt; Invite your friends! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't be discouraged by the small number of RSVPs on this site; we usually have 20-30 attendees!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt; This meetup event is cross-posted at the Boston Republican Party Meetup Group and on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk to the back section near the fireplace &amp; TV.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>4385831</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264115200000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Republicans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>republican-94</urlname><id>131129</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Republican Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260967874000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Republican January Meetup</name><id>mvkvyncbzb</id><headcount>60</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263942000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/republican-94/events/12095906/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/f/global_8964575.jpeg</photo_url></item>
