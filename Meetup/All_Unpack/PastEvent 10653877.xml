If anyone wants to be the point of contact please let me know! - Andy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's do a little cross training this weekend with a hike of the Middlesex Fells Skyline Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail follows the outer perimeter of the western Fells. There are great views of Boston and the surrounding area. Most of the Skyline trail is in wooded landscape, with several steep ascents to rocky outcrops. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can view a trail map &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/502534/middlesexfells.jpeg"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail is 6.9 miles and average hiking time is 5 hours. It is considered a difficult hike and my plan is to keep things moving with minimal breaks for water, snacks, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring sturdy footgear, insect repellent, sun block, food and at least a liter of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is dependent on the weather and the current forecast calls for 75 degrees and showers, but we'll keep an eye on it and pray for sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=114321057277806371939.00045b6fbad7d7bd48bce&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=17"&gt;Sheepfold parking area&lt;/a&gt; off of route 28 (see directions below). For those of you who are not dog lovers you should know that the Sheepfold area is a popular place for dog owners to meet and let their animals run free. Dogs are often on the trails as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting time is 9am and we will head out promptly at 9:15. I will send my cell number out to attendees so that you can call me if you're running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Sheepfold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MBTA:&lt;br /&gt;Orange Line to Wellington Station, MBTA bus #100 to Roosevelt Circle Rotary, walk south to the rotary, turn right on South Border Road, Bellevue Pond is 1/5 mile right on South Border Road.
