I would rather be gaming with my bro-s and my ho-s. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... if you want to have a crappy time dealing with long lines and bitchy parents having to spend money on garbage their kids will only appreciate for 2 weeks... then enjoy the mad rush of purchasing this season.  However... if you want to have a kick arse time playing cool games and hanging out with fun people kicking my arse at games, then come by and enjoy for the entirety of the day!&lt;/p&gt;
