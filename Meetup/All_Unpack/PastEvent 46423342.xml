Two Conquer artists are performing at Hennessey's on Union St. (Fanueil Hall) from 5-7:30pm -- Mia Boostrom, of two-time America's Got Talent fame, &amp;amp; Ryan McHugh, with a career including regular gigs in the Boston area &amp;amp; beyond as well as a performance for tv's "The Sopranos"! The duo puts on quite a show, playing a range of music including hits across genres like pop, rock &amp;amp; more! No cover &amp;amp; a fun bar that also serves great food! Conquer contact: Nina Pickell, Certified Artist Developer team lead, at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target="_blank"&gt;617-513-9631&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a definite fun time! Start your weekend off right with a little bit o' live music, good food and spirits.&amp;nbsp; I should be there around 5:30pm and will try to get a couple of tables up close in front but this place gets a good after work crowd so it will be busy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hennessy's is conveniently located in the Haymarket, easily accessible to the Green, Blue and Orange lines.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO. Don't forget to tip your bartender/server! ;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

NOTE: THIS EVENT IS CROSSLISTED WITH SOCIAL FUN AND BOSTON HAPPY HOUR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Isabel Bourelle</member_name><member_id>8394555</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326046327000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325599424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Happy Hour</name><id>46423342</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1325889000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/46423342/</event_url></item>
