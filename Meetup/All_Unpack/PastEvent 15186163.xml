Try walking. What an inspirational and uplifting feeling a walk can bring. They've helped to strengthen my spiritual self, and they may help you in an ongoing spiritual journey.  &lt;br /&gt;I have just experienced one of these moments and another incredible experience has transpired. I would love to share this with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lake Quannapowitt in Wakefield&lt;/b&gt; for a transformational walk.&lt;br /&gt;We will meet by the boat dock, in the parking lot, at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Corner of Church St. &amp;amp; North Ave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lake is about 3 miles round trip and should take us 1-2 hours to complete.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on stopping midway for a bite to eat, drink and chat at my favorite place the &lt;span style="color: chocolate"&gt;Gingerbread Construction Co.&lt;/span&gt; before moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise you this will be a true Spiritual an Uplifting experience.&lt;br /&gt;So please bring your walking shoes, your listening ears, &amp;amp; an open heart.&lt;br /&gt;Come join me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking lot by the Boat Slip </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ellen</member_name><member_id>9941060</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288658302000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>northofbostonlawofattraction</urlname><id>567480</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The North-of-Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287691835000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spiritual Walk Around the Lake </name><id>15186163</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288450800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/northofbostonlawofattraction/events/15186163/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/5/global_6948997.jpeg</photo_url></item>
