So, let's go to a really nice one that's not too large. It's also easy to drive to, walk to, bike to and its right across the street from the Brookline Village Green Line station. We'll meet at the Inner Space Yoga (17 Station St.) where there are 4 artists and plan where to go after that.  Brookline Open Studios is an annual springtime event, held in locations all over Brookline, since 1986. Artists working in all media participate by opening their homes and studios to the public for one weekend. This allows viewers to experience the dynamic impact of viewing original artworks within the artist's creative space. The public connection to the artist nurtures an understanding of the creative process. Much of the artwork is for sale, providing an incredible chance for collectors and the general public to acquire original pieces directly from the artist. &lt;a href="http://www.brooklineartists.com" target="_blank"&gt;Brookline Artists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Q.</member_name><member_id>2269958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272907020000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272375918000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brookline Open Studios</name><id>13304982</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272733200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/13304982/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/a/global_14676298.jpeg</photo_url></item>
