He didn't think he'd be out before spring, but sometimes the force is too strong in him. Turns out this Saturday, Whiskey Republic is having an outdoor block party. Doc just can't resist making an appearance at this type of event. It'll be a chilly night, so bundle up or drink a few warming beverages. Water St will blocked off, so plan for driving/parking. Doc expects there will be a crowd, but he'll be there somewhere with sunglasses on and a Gansett in hand. Why not join..?&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doc LateNite</member_name><member_id>9585499</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316403011000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316039165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Block Partying with Doc LateNite</name><id>33591352</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316304000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/33591352/</event_url></item>
