It's Hack Night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This months (STILL STILL very loose) agenda is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Welcome to new people.&lt;br /&gt;2) Open Code Reviews - a fast way to understand Ruby idioms. Bring a class or method and the group can tear it apart and build it up again (if needed...maybe *you'll* be teaching us a thing or two.)&lt;br /&gt;3) Open problem solving, help with dev environments for new users, open discussion.&lt;br /&gt;4) Lightning talks (If anyone has one they want to present.)&lt;br /&gt;6) Dinner? This is up in the air. Post to the list what your desire is. We'll can break around 8:30 - 9:00 and go out for food on Rt-9 or we can plan on having food at the location. I know *I* plan on getting a beer or two after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of this night is to solve your problems, share nifty hacks, and learn new stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are completely new and want help setting up a Ruby development environment, bring your machine and you'll probably leave with a working development environment. I said probably. :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You can't miss me.
