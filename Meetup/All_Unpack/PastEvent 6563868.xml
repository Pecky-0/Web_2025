I have had one request for a medium-level trail. We can decide at that day if we all want to do one path or if we want to break up into groups (if some want to do a tougher trail and some want to do an easier trail).  Feel free to post your preference in your RSVP. May go to lunch at a restaurant near Sleeping Giant after the hike if there is interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's too early to know what the weather will be like that day so check back when it gets closer. If it rains that day, I'll probably reschedule the hike for Sunday or another weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the Sleeping Giant parking lot at 11:00 am. There hasn?t been a charge to park yet but I don?t know if that will change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact is Karen, 203-535-8751&lt;br /&gt;(I copied Andrea's event from May, thanks Andrea!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193065892000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192588770000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday am-- Hike at Sleeping Giant</name><id>6563868</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192892400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6563868/</event_url></item>
