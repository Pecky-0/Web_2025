I know for some of you it is far but I hope you can come since it is for a great cause! And there are different length walks for all so everyone can join us! And you don't have to walk if you don't want to, there is a lot to see and do! Read below, it is right from their website!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Take Steps to Help Pets. Participate in Concord-Merrimack County SPCA’s 15th annual “Walk for the Animals” fundraiser and you can help provide a better life for abandoned animals. Join us Sunday, September 26, 2010 at Northeast Delta Dental in Concord, located at 1 Delta Drive. The funds raised at our Walk make a vast difference in the lives of many homeless pets that come to the shelter. Our Walk is a day of fun demonstrations, contests, raffles and more! Bring family, friends, co-workers, club members and anyone who wants to enjoy a great day!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's from 10am til 3pm! Everyone is invited!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At the front registration desk if they are there at 10 if not call my cell which is posted for the event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jamie</member_name><member_id>8350267</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285589554000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284249757000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Walk for the Animals!</name><id>14737852</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285509600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/14737852/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/5/global_17869461.jpeg</photo_url></item>
