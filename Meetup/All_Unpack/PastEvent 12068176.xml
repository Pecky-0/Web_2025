Come relax after New Year's Eve, nosh some food, and have some fun with pieces, tokens, dice, and cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;See below for a list of games that I own&lt;/b&gt;; feel free to bring anything else you have.  I'll keep a running list of games people are bringing, so we won't have duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'm also asking you to bring some nosh food (snacks)&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;u&gt;non-alcoholic&lt;/u&gt; drinks.  &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;I am a strict vegetarian, so you cannot bring cheese (cheddar popcorn, e.g.), marshmallows or gelatin (jello).&lt;/span&gt;  Milk, eggs and butter are fine.  Chocolate-themed food is very fine!  Or chips, pretzels, cookies, cake, etc.  If people are interested in making mulled cider, I have the spices; hot chocolate (milk + melted chocolate) would also be great (we can have whipped cream with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;It is rude to both the organizer (that's me) and to the other attendees (that's all of you) if you RSVP Yes and then don't show up.  SO DON'T RSVP YES unless you know you can definitely make it!  If your plans change--then change your RSVP.&lt;/span&gt;  I understand you may not be sure you'll be in the mood for going out on January 1st -- so in that case, mark yourself down as a Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'd rather have 1 Yes (who I know is definitely coming) and 10 Maybe's (who may or may not show up) than have 5 or 8 people say Yes and then not come.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;b&gt;If there's a big waitlist&lt;/b&gt;, then I'll ask the Maybe's to change to Yes/No, to allow definites to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'm scheduling this to start at 1pm, for after lunch/brunch.&lt;/b&gt;  (Please eat a meal before you come.)  But you're welcome to show up late -- if people are all in the middle of games, you'll have to wait until one ends to join in, but there will also be cards, etc. for you to entertain yourself with (and it's usually easy to jump in on a party game).  You can also leave early (as long as you don't leave in the middle of a game you're playing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll play at least until 5 or 6pm, or whenever people want to stop.  If people love playing and don't want to stop, but are really hungry, you can order food in--but it has to be vegetarian (really!  I said I'm strict!).  There's an Indian restaurant down the street, among others, that has lots of vegetarian options.  Ask me about this in advance so I can prepare (get you menus, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I live in Jamaica Plain&lt;/b&gt;, off the Orange line and 39 bus; there's also free street parking.  Exact address will be given to those who RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also note:  I &lt;u&gt;won't&lt;/u&gt; be checking my e-mail on January 1st.&lt;/b&gt;  So get all the info you need from me by mid-day on 12/31.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Games I own:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life&lt;br /&gt;Mastermind&lt;br /&gt;Backgammon&lt;br /&gt;Mille Borne&lt;br /&gt;Rummy Q &lt;br /&gt;Yahtzee&lt;br /&gt;Uno&lt;br /&gt;Pictionary &lt;br /&gt;Monopoly &lt;br /&gt;decks of cards&lt;br /&gt;Boggle/Big Boggle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Games others are bringing:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bang, Stone Age (RSVP is Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Scrabble (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Racko, Phase 10 (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Space Hulk (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Dalmuti, Taboo, Mars Fluxx (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Apples to Apples (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Carcassone, Settlers of Catan (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Bananagrams (Maybe) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Food/drinks others are bringing:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;chocolate and tapioca pudding (RSVP is Yes)&lt;br /&gt;apple juice (Yes)&lt;br /&gt;carrots (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;a few single-serve bottles of diet Pepsi (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;orange juice (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Chai (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;sweet potato pie (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;casserole (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;Pepsi, chips/popcorn (Yes) &lt;br /&gt;cupcakes (RSVP is Maybe) &lt;br /&gt;hummus &amp;amp; pita (Maybe) &lt;br /&gt;pie (Maybe) &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I live in Jamaica Plain; I'll give my address to people who RSVP Yes</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1262613134000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260577214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Year's Day board games (Jamaica Plain)</name><id>12068176</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262368800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/12068176/</event_url></item>
