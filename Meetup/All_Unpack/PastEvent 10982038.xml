I can't wait to share this gem with the group!&lt;/i&gt; (Please note: the $5.00 cost is in addition to the cost of your meal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are some reviews in the news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bamboo House takes you on an aromatic journey and brings you straight to brilliant flavor fest. The minute you step through the doors of The Bamboo House you’re transported thousands of miles east to a warm-hearted Vietnamese household....Sharing a bowl of soup takes on a whole new meaning at The Bamboo House. In Vietnamese culture it’s traditional to see a family sitting around a table, slurping up flavorful broth and noodle soups. The soup dishes at The Bamboo House are tantalizing to the senses and incorporate distinct spices like chili, lemon, mint leaves, and sprouts. Vietnamese soups appear to balance the worlds of sugar and spice like it’s an acrobatic act. My favorite soup was the Pho, a Vietnamese beef noodle soup. The beef was thinly sliced and delicate, melting in your mouth at first contact. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you visit The Bamboo House make sure you have your adventurous hat on because you’re in for a real culinary experience. Don’t be scared to take some risks with your menu chooses. The prices are pretty affordable for the quality and portions you receive.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dishinwithalexis.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/dishin-it-with-alexis-the-bamboo-house/" target="_blank"&gt;Dishin' It With Alexis (Alexis Miller)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;...this little Vietnamese restaurant puts out rich and subtle soups and refreshing salads vibrant with fresh herbs. When it’s hot outside, this is the kind of food that energizes rather than weighs you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, as is the case here, less energy wasted on fancy dishware and pretty wall hangings means more attention dedicated to providing excellent food. So the carpet’s a little shabby and the tables and counters show some wear, but you hardly miss the distraction of soaking up atmosphere, since many of the dishes require your active participation in selecting condiments and garnishes from a gorgeous pile of fresh vegetables and herbs and rolling them up together in a rice paper roll or lettuce leaf.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=1753" target="_blank"&gt;Valley Advocate Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have room for 25 foodies at this event, so please make sure to register early here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Western-Mass-Eat-Up/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we will be the largest table!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254266163000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>food lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Western-Mass-Eat-Up</urlname><id>1464899</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western Mass Eat-Up!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248833081000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August [Western Mass] Eat Up! at the Bamboo House in Springfield</name><id>10982038</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251064800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Western-Mass-Eat-Up/events/10982038/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/f/5/global_9925269.jpeg</photo_url></item>
