Join us Sunday evening at the movies to see The Hangover Part III. We will be joining members of another Meetup group for the 6:45 showtime, so let's meet at 6:15 in the lobby by the entrance to the restaurant in the lobby. Since this is opening weekend for this movie, and it's also a Holiday weekend, I expect it to be crowded. I strongly suggest buying tickets in advance online. Please use the following link: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

After the movie, we will be heading out to one of the local establishments for a drink and/or a bite to eat. Depending on the weather, either Shea's outdoor patio or Boston Gourmet Pizza are both good options we have done in the past. We can meet back in the lobby after the movie and make our final decision then. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures comes “The Hangover Part III,” the third and final film in director Todd Phillips’ record-shattering comedy franchise. &lt;br /&gt;

This time, there’s no wedding. No bachelor party. What could go wrong, right? &lt;br /&gt;

But when the Wolfpack hits the road, all bets are off. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

“The Hangover Part III” reunites Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha as Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug. Also returning to the ensemble are Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow, Heather Graham as Jade, and Jeffrey Tambor as Alan’s father, Sid. Joining the starring cast is John Goodman.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby by the entrance to the restaurant</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>3461529</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leslie</member_name><member_id>6069707</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369617432000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1367939973000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hangover Part III</name><id>qvgncfyrhbjc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369606500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/118171462/</event_url></item>
