Maher bumped into Ellen Berklend, Archeologist for the City of Boston while she was giving a talk at the Old South Meeting House regarding her archeological survey of Spectacle Island [ &lt;i&gt;Notes on the lecture contained on &amp;quot;Spectacle Island and Its Native American Past @ The Old South Meeting House&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/calendar/11686756/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt; ] back in November. Of course, when she asked after the wonderful lecture if there were any questions, T.J. shouted out &amp;quot;Do you give tours of the Archeology Lab?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes. Yes she does. Anybody want to join me in a tour of the lab? We have limited space for the tour, only 36 people. Feel free to initially RSVP &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; but please try to firm up your plans as the date gets closer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if you missed that lecture, it is now posted on PBS and NPR's Forum Network, at &lt;a href="http://forum-network.org/speaker/ellen-berkland"&gt;http://forum-network....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be waiting in the lobby of the Archeology lab starting at 6:00 pm if people want to drop by before the tour. The lab is in the basement of 152 North Street. The door to the building isn't clearly marked, he was told, but if you walk around you can find it. It's the gold-domed brick building between the entrance of the Callahan and exit of the Sumner Tunnels. The front door faces North Street, not the open area on the Rose Kennedy Greenway. You get to the basement by the elevator. Wow this is complex. T.J. needs to remember to duct tape a red MEETUP sign on the door, and next to the elevator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can take a headcount just before the tour on who wants to grab dinner somewhere in the North End, and reserve a table there before the tour. Ellen Berkland recommended La Famiglia Giorgio &lt;a href="http://www.lafamigliagiorgio.com/menu.htm"&gt;http://www.lafamiglia...&lt;/a&gt; up the street, since they easily accomodate large parties. Judging from their website, they encourage multiple people to split their ten to fifteen dollar pasta dishes. Judging by the reviews on Yelp, La Famiglia Giorgio is not the absolute best in the entire North End if you are a big foodie, but it is still good food, and very accommodating to last minute parties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the City Archeology Program&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/Environment/program.asp"&gt;http://www.cityofbost...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;At the urging of the Massachusetts Historical Commission, the position of City Archaeologist was created in 1983 as part of the Boston Landmarks Commission to protect Boston's archaeological resources [...] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Today, the Environment Department's City Archaeologist manages the archaeological remains located on public land in Boston, and over 27 collections of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts held by the City. The City Archaeologist is also committed to public outreach and education in archaeology for Boston city schoolchildren and the public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The City Archaeology Program offers a number of opportunities for the public to experience Boston's archaeological legacy. The 4,000-square-foot City Archaeology Laboratory, Education, and Curation Center is located in the North End in the brick, gold-domed building between the entrance to the Callahan Tunnel and the exit of the Sumner Tunnel, just 200 feet west of the Freedom Trail. At present, the lab is open Monday through Friday by appointment, and on weekends for special events. During the last year, thousands of visitors toured the lab and viewed the collections. Other activities offered by the City Archaeology Program include a hands-on artifact type collection, an artifact washing and processing station, an experimental Native American ceramic workshop, a simulated dig box, and many other stations&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conversations: Digging Under Beantown&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Archeology.Org. Volume 57 Number 5, September/October 2004  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.org/0409/etc/conversations.html"&gt;http://www.archaeolog...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A professional archaeologist for more than 18 years, Ellen Berkland has been Boston's city archaeologist since 1996. She runs the City Archaeology Laboratory, Education and Curation Center, where 27 collections excavated from sites in Boston are kept, including half of those from the $14.6-billion, decades-long highway project officially called the Central Artery/Tunnel Project but better known as the 'Big Dig.' ARCHAEOLOGY recently asked Berkland about her work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[Q.] &lt;i&gt;What was your role in the Big Dig?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[A.] I've worn many different hats. My favorite was a hardhat, digging as a crew member on various sites. Being the first person to uncover deposits left by other humans hundreds and even thousands of years ago is pretty exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[Q.] &lt;i&gt;Has all of the Big Dig archaeological work been completed?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[A.] The project reports have been submitted and approved, and the results and the collections are available to the public through popular reports, a website, educational materials, and an artifact exhibit at the Commonwealth Museum in Dorchester. Next time you're in Boston, come visit me at the City Archaeology Lab in Boston's North End! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[Q.] &lt;i&gt;What was the most surprising thing found during the Big Dig?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[A.] The condition of artifacts in a seventeenth-century privy. This waterlogged, sealed environment preserved extremely fragile organic remains such as bugs and parasites, pollen remains, seeds and bones, and even leather shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[Q.] &lt;i&gt;How did you become an archaeologist?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[A.] My digging career began at a very early age in a gigantic backyard sandbox designed and built by my father, Ted. Many hours were spent burying, mapping, and excavating things. I even had a Barbie cemetery at one point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[Q.] &lt;i&gt;You live in Boston's oldest home, the Blake House, built in 1648. Does living there give you any insights into your work?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[A.] The Blake House in Dorchester is an important artifact. It's hard not to think of the hundreds of people who were born, and who lived and died, in the 'Blakey'...especially with the family burying ground (ca. 1634) right around the corner. It makes me realize that we are only a blink in the eons of time&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Via T&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* From Haymarket Station on the Orange Line: 6 minutes, according to Google Maps: &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Haymarket+Station&amp;amp;daddr=152+North+St,+Boston,+MA+02113&amp;amp;geocode=FY1ohgIdjrzD-ylXyqwMj3DjiTGR6LCdC3A0Gw%3BFXNphgIdh83D-ylXf0fhiHDjiTFG0G9chnr3lw&amp;amp;sll=42.361866,-71.05544&amp;amp;sspn=0.005557,0.008272&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;mra=cc&amp;amp;dirflg=w&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=17"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* From Government Center on the Green Line: 10 minutes, according to Google Maps: &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=Court+St&amp;amp;daddr=152+North+St,+Boston,+MA+02113&amp;amp;geocode=FQ1ahgId_rfD-w%3BFXNphgIdh83D-ylXf0fhiHDjiTFG0G9chnr3lw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;mra=dme&amp;amp;mrcr=0&amp;amp;mrsp=0&amp;amp;sz=17&amp;amp;dirflg=w&amp;amp;sll=42.360669,-71.055858&amp;amp;sspn=0.005557,0.008272&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.360954,-71.055493&amp;amp;spn=0.005557,0.008272&amp;amp;z=17"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
