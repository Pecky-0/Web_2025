This 5 piece band pays homage to the golden- throated, guitar slinging pioneers of rock-n-roll, focusing on much of the pre-Vegas Elvis era, as well as many of The King's compatriots, like Carl Perkins, Bill Hayley, and Jerry Lee Lewis, to name a few. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever thumb through the Want-Advertiser looking for a used automobile and stumble upon those ads with the side note - &amp;quot;great for parts?&amp;quot; Velvet Elvis is just that - the sum of extremely salvageable parts from classic Boston area bands, welded together to create one finely tuned, well oiled Roots Rock/Rockabill Rock. Rich Bartlett, of The Fools fame, provides the V-6string engine that gets the audience rockin' from 0-60 in seemingly zero time. &lt;br /&gt;Jimmy Rogers is the aftermarket flare that customizes the style and energy of what is known as Velvet Elvis - Boston's Best Tribute to Elvis and the Pioneers of Rock and Roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From Mass.
