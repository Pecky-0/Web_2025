<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Join us for a winter weekend get-away in Bar Harbor (Friday-Sunday). Acadia National Park offers 45 miles of carriage roads that are fabulous for skiing and snow shoing of all abilities, you can also enjoy winter hiking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; his is a tentative date, but we should have ample snow by them. Due to the large response (I put the invite out to 2 other groups I belong to), I am leaving it up to individuals to make their own reservations. I will gather a list of Inns, B&amp;amp;B's, motels etc so people can shop around and stay where they want. I'll also try to keep a list of where people are staying for coordination purposes.  We will head up on  Friday, ski and snowshoe on Sat and Sun, socialize, have dinner together etc on Friday and Saturday night. From what I've seen so far, off-season rates are $40-70 per night for 2 (that is usually with a queen size bed, or 2 twins). I'll update as info becomes available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.barharborinfo.com/lodging_frame2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Bar Harbor Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good resource for lodging info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be staying at a B&amp;amp;B right in the heart of town, not sure which one yet though.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>This event is run by Tara</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202666655000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190750475000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>XC Ski/Snow Shoe weekend at Acadia National Park</name><id>6426257</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202493600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/6426257/</event_url></item>
