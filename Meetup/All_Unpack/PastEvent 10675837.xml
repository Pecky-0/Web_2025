Some of the proposed taxes are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  49% tax on expanded gambling in the form of Video Slots.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Suspension of the Business Enterprise Tax Credit in 2011 penalizing companies based on the dollar amount of their payroll.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Increase in the Rooms &amp;amp; Meals Tax to 8.75% (a 10% increase).&lt;br /&gt;4.  confiscation of $110 million dollars from the Joint Medical Malpractice Insurance Fund.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Increase in the Tobacco Tax to $1.78.  The fourth increase in five years.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Increase in the fee for drivers License's, Car Registrations, Vanity Plates and doubles the Boat Registration fee.&lt;br /&gt;7.  eliminates the EZ Pass discount&lt;br /&gt;8.  Increases the Home Heating Oil Tax by 25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a list of proposed taxes.  It does not contain any of the additional taxes already approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind folks, that we are in a recession!  There should be no tax increases whatsoever. &lt;br /&gt;Further, it really comes down to their excess SPENDING which is completely out of control.  &lt;br /&gt;If you want to take back your country, it must start with your State. &lt;br /&gt;Please be there on June 24th and bring your signs focusing on &amp;quot;It's the Spending Stupid&amp;quot; or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Kimball&lt;br /&gt;Granite State Patriots&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246032479000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245280773000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>State Of NH Tea Party</name><id>10675837</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245859200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/10675837/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/f/global_6800399.jpeg</photo_url></item>
