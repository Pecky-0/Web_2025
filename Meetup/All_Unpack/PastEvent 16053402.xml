Do you often wish you could go dancing but don't like going alone and your roommates/cousins/workmates aren't willing?  Would you like to go anyway but would like some support and friendly faces that you know?  Then let's all get together and go dancing on a Sat night at the beautiful SpringStep bulding in Medford.  This mothly dance is very beginner friendly and a LOT of fun and a great opportunity to meet different people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can meet at a local Medford restaraunt (TBD but prob within walking distance) for drinks/snack first.  Everybody will have a chance to meet each other and break the ice a bit before we walk over for the free 1 hour lesson at 8pm.  The dance starts at 9pm, and the cost is $18.  I'm excited about this because I *love* soul music!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details here:&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;a href="http://www.bluescafeboston.com/2010/10/january-22-2011-tbd/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bluescafeb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;Band info here:&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/chickenslacks" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David</member_name><member_id>3357411</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295745713000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Socializing</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>wakefieldweeknights</urlname><id>1270802</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Wakefield Weeknights and More!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295051850000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swing/Soul/Blues Dancing on a Sa.t night in Medford</name><id>16053402</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295740800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/wakefieldweeknights/events/16053402/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/d/global_17499549.jpeg</photo_url></item>
