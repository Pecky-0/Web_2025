<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So according to the poll, more people would like to have the Block Island Trip on the 30th.  Why don't we meet at our place (parking is easy and free), we can then carpool down to Point Judith and take the ferry.  Round trip rate is 17.40 (on the traditional ferry).  There is one that leaves at 10:30, and if we leave the house by 9:30 we should be fine (hence the meetup time at 9:00am).  If you are running late give me a call at 630 857 0556.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikes are easy to rent in town.  We plan on spending some quality time on the beach as well so bring ,or wear, some swimgear and a beachtowel.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We generally stop by the little grocery there on Block Island to pick up some picnic goodies - bread, cheeses, deli meat - then stuff it all in our backpack and head off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an all day event so plan on leaving early and catching the last ferry back - maybe we can stop at the little beachfront pub in point judith for fresh seafood and beer after we make it back to the mainland that evening?  We will see how the mood is at that time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can all make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Brad&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ring Doorbell</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Taylor</member_name><member_id>1999104</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220404968000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216922223000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bicycle Tour Around Block Island</name><id>8404504</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220101200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/8404504/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
