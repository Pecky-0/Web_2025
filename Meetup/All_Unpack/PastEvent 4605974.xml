Tangosol is also graciously providing light refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the presentation we are planning to move to a nearby bar (TBD) to continue on in a more relaxed atmosphere :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you all at the meetup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About presentation:&lt;br /&gt;Cameron Purdy will discuss application development considerations for&lt;br /&gt;maximum scalable performance and reliability in clustered J2EE  environments.&lt;br /&gt;He will focus on improving scalability and scalable performance of applications through the use of clustered caching, and will describe Tangosol's architectural approach to the challenges of reliably sharing live data among clustered JVMs in the application tier while providing transparent fail-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Cameron:&lt;br /&gt;Cameron Purdy is president of Tangosol and has ten years of experience with Java and Java-related technology.  He is a frequent presenter at industry conferences and has received a number of awards in recognition of his contribution to the Java community.
