<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Good News Everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I finally got off my ass and scheduled this event! I've been saying for a while now that I wanted to do a day at KRF, so lets do this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Faire is open from 10:30 to 6:00 every day. Don't worry if you can't make it for the 11 AM meeting at the Faire. We will be there a decent portion of the day and we should be able to round stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://kingrichardsfaire.net/about-2/about-krf/" target="_blank"&gt;King Richard's Faire&lt;/a&gt; is located at &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=235+Main+Street,+Carver,+MA&amp;amp;sll=44.961882,-93.440626&amp;amp;sspn=0.012374,0.025427&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=235+Main+St,+Carver,+Plymouth,+Massachusetts+02330&amp;amp;z=17&amp;amp;ll=41.8642,-70.7608" target="_blank"&gt;235 Main Street in Carver, MA&lt;/a&gt; about an hour outside of Boston. It has free parking on site. Tickets are $26, but there are $2 discounts available from the Metro newspaper (the one they give away on the T). If we get a group of 25+ (doubtful but possible) we can get tickets for $22. Children 5-11 are $15. Any children younger are free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a list of events and shows going on at the Faire, please refer to their website: &lt;a href="http://kingrichardsfaire.net/entertainment/entertainment-schedule/" target="_blank"&gt;http://kingrichardsfa...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to dress in costume for the event, feel free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;-Josh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If we do get 25 people, I will set up an Amazon payment thing so we can get the group discount. If not, we can just get tickets at the gate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You can call me at 774-766-2094.
