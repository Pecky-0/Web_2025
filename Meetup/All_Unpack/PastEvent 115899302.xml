&lt;p&gt;Guests will be transported into a world where dirigibles and hot air balloons race the skies, an old-fashioned midway entertains the crowds, and there are unique performers, musicians, and characters at every corner all telling the story of their world. International published authors and entertainers known nationwide will fill our bookstores and auditoriums. The town common will be transformed into a bazaar filled with vendors offering fine leatherwork, costumes and wearables, gadgets and jewelery along with buskers and demonstrations that tip their hat to a realm forgotten. There is even a race for Mayor to put the best man or woman into the seat to make decisions on the future of Watch City! &lt;br /&gt;

 The event is family-friendly but will also offer some adult entertainment in the form of “Steampunk After Dark” events which will entice guests with musical acts, burlesque dancers and carnival side-show performances. &lt;br /&gt;
