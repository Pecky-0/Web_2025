I have 20 signed with our other group but could fit a other 20 more. Bickfords is a very popular place with a lot of my cards group members the food is awesome they have a full bar. They have anything from breakfast straight through the weekend to a fried calamari dinner. The is no T transportation but there is a bus just not sure how late it runs. We will have a night 24 hours worth of open cards and games and bridge. The snow shouldn't scare you all away it is supposed to be lit and most of it overnight.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We have our own private room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Brown</member_name><member_id>8675153</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy Blum</member_name><member_id>8796666</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361119942000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1361018168000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back to bickfords again joint event with c and c and Beantown bridge</name><id>104868322</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361052000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/104868322/</event_url></item>
