(&lt;a href="http://www.saysyou.net" target="_blank"&gt;www.saysyou.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.saysyou.net" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) travels the country taping radio shows in front of a live audience. This fall, Pipit and Finch (the program's creators) will be taping at the Emerson Umbrella Center for the Arts in Concord, Massachusetts. I have always wanted to attend a taping of Says You! I can hear Richard Sher's voice already. If you're a fan of the show, you know exactly what I mean!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased a ticket for myself, as follows:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, October 2, 2010  &lt;br /&gt;7:30 p.m. (I plan to be there by 7:00 p.m.)  &lt;br /&gt;Reserved Seating ($30.00)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to arrive early (by 7:00 p.m.) to introduce myself to the other Nerd Fun members. Two shows will be taped, with an intermission between them. We can catch up during the intermission, too. I will update this event once again as we get closer to October.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: &lt;b&gt;You must purchase a ticket to get into the live taping&lt;/b&gt;. Go to &lt;a href="http://www.saysyou.net" target="_blank"&gt;www.saysyou.net&lt;/a&gt; for more information about purchasing tickets. &lt;b&gt;As of September 13, 2010, both the reserved-seat and general-admission tickets are sold out for the Saturday, October 2, 2010, taping.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can go out after the taping if anyone would like. I have done some research on Concord night life and it is limited, which is what I expected. The Main Streets Market and Cafe hosts live music (sometimes jazz) on Saturdays from 8:30 to 11:30 p.m. There's a good chance the Says You! taping will continue long enough that we will miss any night life that Concord has to offer, but we can keep the Main Streets Market and Cafe in mind, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Streets Market and Cafe&lt;br /&gt;42 Main Street, Concord, MA&lt;br /&gt;978.369.9948&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mainstreetsmarketandcafe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.mainstreetsmarketandcafe.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marianne&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marianne</member_name><member_id>9387943</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286152971000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282749927000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live Taping of Says You! -- Saturday Night Is Sold Out</name><id>14536977</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286060400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14536977/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/d/global_17461325.jpeg</photo_url></item>
