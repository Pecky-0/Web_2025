His address is 130 Newbury St and his phone number 203-767-3514. Feel free to call whenever. Once again if you can't make it to his place by 6 just head to the Copley T stop on the Green Line and we will basically be standing within 100 feet of the entrance/exit. The more the merrier even if you can only make it for a little bit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring signs, Tea Party flyers and regular Ron Paul literature to hand out to those who want more information about him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is in need of literature and/or signs (and lawn holders), Corie has a surplus and would love to get a lot of it distributed. Call her at 508-308-9008 to come pick it up. She lives in the North End.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197852404000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197432418000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Copley T-Stop Flyer Distribution / Sign Wave</name><id>6898351</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197671400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/6898351/</event_url></item>
