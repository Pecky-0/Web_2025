&lt;p&gt;The end of the eighties in the twentieth century. Alois Nebel works as a dis­patcher at the small railway station in Bílý Potok, a remote village on the Czech–Polish border. He’s a loner, who prefers old timetables to people, and he finds the loneliness of the station tranquil – except when the fog rolls in. Then he hallucinates, sees trains from the last hundred years pass through the station. They bring ghosts and shadows from the dark past of Central Eu­rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alois can’t get rid of these nightmares and eventually ends up in sanatorium. In the sanatorium, he gets to know The Mute, a man carrying an old photograph who was arrested by the police after crossing the border. No one knows why he came to Bílý Potok or who he’s looking for, but it is his past that propels Alois on his journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film will be introduced by Igor Lukes, Professor of International Relations and History and Honorary Consul of the Czech Republic in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366723376000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366478130000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Film Screening: Alois Nebel (Czech Republic, 84 minutes)</name><id>115311302</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366668000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/115311302/</event_url></item>
