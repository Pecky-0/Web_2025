We will be holding a holiday gift swap, but don't think you need to go out and buy something!  We know that regifting is a considered taboo, but not here!  We all have received gifts that weren't for us, or purchased something with the intentions of using it, and later find it sitting around with the tags still on.  These things would make great items for our gift swap.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your wrapped item to the breakfast meeting, and participate in our gift swap game, everyone is sure to walk away with something exciting!  We tried this for the first time last year, and it was a blast!  There will also be more time to do some networking than our regular meetings, so make sure to take advantage of it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Allison Biggs</member_name><member_id>10438666</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292696422000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Womens-Business-Owners-Alliance</urlname><id>1525453</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>Women Business Owners Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291139530000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Breakfast Meeting and Gift Swap</name><id>15596453</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292503500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Womens-Business-Owners-Alliance/events/15596453/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/d/global_10758349.jpeg</photo_url></item>
