Tell the security guard you are here for the Plone Users Group meeting. Call me on my cell if you have trouble. If coming by T, closest stop is green line Symphony T stop. Hynes Convention Center is also very close, as is Mass Ave (Orange line). Parking at the Christian Science Center underground parking garage available, but will cost $5. Please let the parking attendant know that you are here for the Plone Meetup hosted by Danny Robert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that while the official location of the church is 1 Norway Street, the meetup location is in the Christian Science Church Park and is closer to Huntington Ave. See this &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/yegprt" target="_blank"&gt;Google map&lt;/a&gt; for clarification.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180930506000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172192632000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone March Meetup</name><id>5505551</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174604400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/5505551/</event_url></item>
