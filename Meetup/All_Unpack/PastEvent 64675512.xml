&lt;p&gt;This is an easy paddle, about 1 1/2 hours, so it will be a good route for beginners, we'll go through the pond into the lake by Sunset Beach, continue through the lake a bit and back into the pond at the other side. We'll meet at the Flint Pond State Boat Ramp on Rt. 20 in Shrewsbury, which is about 100 yards east of the Shrewsbury/Worcester line. The entrance to the boat ramp is at the traffic light at the intersection of Rt. 20 and Edgemere Blvd.&lt;/p&gt;
