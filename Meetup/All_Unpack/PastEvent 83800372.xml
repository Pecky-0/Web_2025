&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to reduce the negative effects of stress on your body and mind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you want to try something fun that will improve your physical, emotional, and spiritual health?   Medical research shows that Laughter will do it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Sherry will be your laughter guide to an evening of fun and laughter. Meet new friends in a fun easy-going atmosphere. Just bring with you some child-like playfulness and an openness to laugh and connect with other people who also are looking for more fun in their lives!  You'll leave class with a blissful feeling and a glow (both inside and outside) that will last for hours afterwards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our evening will be based on activities used in Laughter Yoga (a branch of Yoga developed in India by Dr Madan Kataria) and by the World Laughter Tour.  &lt;em&gt;We'll play fun interactive games that will lead to infectious laughter!   It's very simple and easy.  Don't worry--NO physical yoga postures or poses will be used. Our only connection to other forms of Yoga will be deep breathing exercises.  We'll even burn a couple of hundred calories as we work out over 350 muscles from our waist up to our heads! &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laughter has many proven physical benefits: It boosts the immune system's production of disease-fighting T-cells, releases endorphins that serve as natural pain killers and make us feel good, helps reduce stress, anxiety &amp;amp; blood pressure by lowering the level of the stress hormone cortisol, provides aerobic exercise &amp;amp; promotes muscle tone, increases blood flow thereby bringing more oxygen to body cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now over 6,000 Laughter Yoga clubs all around the world and that number is growing every day.  &lt;span style="color : #3366ff"&gt;Laughter Yoga has been recommended by Oprah, Dr. Oz, Dr. Andrew Weil, and Dr. Sanjay Gupta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donations are gratefully accepted (Suggested donation $3-$6)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
