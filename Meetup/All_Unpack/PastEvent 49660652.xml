&lt;p&gt;The 563&amp;plusmn; acres of the Horse Hill Nature Preserve consist of gently rolling to fairly steep terrain and two hills of approximately 400' elevation. The land was cleared for pasture in previous centuries, has been logged several times, and now consists primarily of a mixed hardwood forest with trees between 20 and 60 years of age. The property includes a series of streams, ponds, swamps, and numerous wetlands totaling approximately 60 acres. A power line easement traverses the property, creating a shrubland undergrowth area. A small sandpit was created by previous owners, but sand has not been removed for several years. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be hiking The Loop Trail, between posts 1 through 12 (3.9 miles). &amp;nbsp;At post #3 you can choose to walk the Loop clockwise or counterclockwise. The brochure says walking its entire length can be strenuous (I think at most it should be rated as easy/moderate), and there are several connecting trails that allow visitors to design smaller loops of varying lengths. &amp;nbsp;The Loop Trail is blazed with white.&amp;nbsp;Connecting trails are blazed with blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here is a link to a trail map along with trail descriptions: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to&amp;nbsp;apologize to any hiking regulars who have to work on Saturday. &amp;nbsp;Looking at the weather forecast it seemed like Saturday would more likely be the better day for a hike comparing Saturday and Sunday's forecast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will gather just a short distance down the trial head in order to get the dogs away from the road way.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Bigelow &amp;  Kaitlyn</member_name><member_id>8806889</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327799298000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327543479000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Horse Hill Nature Preserve - The  Loop Trail (3.9 miles)</name><id>49660652</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327762800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/49660652/</event_url></item>
