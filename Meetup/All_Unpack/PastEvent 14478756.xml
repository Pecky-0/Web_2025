Hikes will be Sat, Sun and Monday.  Please try to come up by 11pm on Friday night, we will have a little &amp;quot;byob&amp;quot; around our house bar and get to know everyone.  We have some first time guest coming up for this weekend already so all are welcome (well 21+ only, sorry kids).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What trails are we hiking?   more details to come but here is a quick outline:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday we have 2 hikes planned - an easy hike (about 4 miles) near our house and a advanced hike in the Presidentials.  &lt;br /&gt;Sunday we plan to combine groups and hike Kearsage north, a spectacular view.  The trailhead is a short walk from our ski house - yes that is the advantage of having a house that borders National Forest land.  &lt;br /&gt;Monday we are still open to discussion but make sure you bring a swim suit.  There are many rivers and ponds a short drive from the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night we will hang out, have a few beers (byob) and maybe visit some of the local bars.  Bonfire in front of the house is also an option.  If you want to just relax that is OK too, this will be a pretty chill weekend - no crazy parties.  We have a full commercial kitchen and grill, meals are not included.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is only $20 per night.  We have 20 bedrooms and do not expect many people (1 to 2 people per bedroom).  Please bring sheets, pillow, blanket, towel.  directions and more details will be sent to responders.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>come up Friday between 8pm and 1ppm and ask for George (or just look for the really tall guy)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283562949000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282258614000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike-A-Poluza, Labor Day Weekend</name><id>14478756</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283558400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/14478756/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/7/global_11666887.jpeg</photo_url></item>
