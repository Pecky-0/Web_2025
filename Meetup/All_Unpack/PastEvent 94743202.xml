 &lt;br /&gt;

 In 1957, Melba Pattillo turned sixteen. That was also the year she became a warrior on the front lines of a civil rights firestorm. Following the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, Melba was one of nine teenagers chosen to integrate Little Rock's Central High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Throughout her harrowing ordeal, Melba was taunted by her schoolmates and their parents, threatened by a lynch mob's rope, attacked with lighted sticks of dynamite, and injured by acid sprayed in her eyes. But through it all, she acted with dignity and courage, and refused to back down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is her remarkable story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity by Andrew Solomon&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Solomon’s startling proposition is that diversity is what unites us all. He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabilities, with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender. While each of these characteristics is potentially isolating, the experience of difference within families is universal, as are the triumphs of love Solomon documents in every chapter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
