Against the backdrop of the first decades of the twentieth century, Jean Barnery (Berling) struggles through two marriages, the Great War and the coming mass-production that threatens to render his family's factory obsolete. Assayas skillfully weds this narrative, elliptically presented, to wide-screen cinema-tography that embraces both his usual cool, muted palette and the sunnier hues of central France and Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Yahoo website:&lt;br /&gt;In the early 1900s, a former clergyman divorces his wife, marries another woman and settles in Switzerland. When he must return to France to take over the family porcelain business, the move affects his second marriage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll head to a local restaurant (either Yenching or the Thai restaurant) to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank will be up front and to the right of the screen just after the movie.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Frank will meet folks in the front right of the theater after the movie.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>4007722</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201732210000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><why>A great way to see and discuss a movie with like minded folks.
