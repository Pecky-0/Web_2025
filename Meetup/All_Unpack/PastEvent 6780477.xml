I'm told that singing is a great way to lose weight, so if you ate too much turkey during Thanksgiving, this is a great way to use some energy!  Also, please don't worry about your singing skills - I am proud to say that I have a terrible singing voice, but I still love a great night of karaoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Name: Golden Leaf (&amp;#37329;&amp;#33865;&amp;#23621;)&lt;br /&gt;Address: 20 Hudson st., (next to Ginza restaurant in chinatown)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=20%20Hudson%20St.%2C%20Boston%2C%20MA%2002228" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The closest train station near Golden Leaf is the Chinatown T stop on the Orange Line.  Leaving the train station, you will find yourself on Washington Street.  Continue to walk down Washington Street, and take a right onto Kneeland St.  Follow Kneeland street for 4 blocks until you see Hudson Street on your left. Golden Leaf is located at the entrance to Hudson st.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the event will depend on the number of people attending.  I am setting the price at $20 per person, but it will be much cheaper if we can get many people to attend (as low as $7 if 25 people attend).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please e-mail me if you have any questions. See you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196184380000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195614534000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karaoke Night @ Golden Leaf in Chinatown</name><id>6780477</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195869600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/6780477/</event_url></item>
