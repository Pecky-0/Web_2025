Just over 2 miles, warm up walking through old farm fields transitioning into some rock steps until you come to the bald summit area. Twards the top there are a few spots where you will need to use your hands as well but weather permitting the views can be lovely. &lt;br /&gt;

 We can meet at the parking lot 116 Poole Road Jaffery NH, 03452 at 11:30 or if anyone would like a ride I will be at the Springfield VT exit 7 park and ride at 10:15 am. The NH Parks Dept charges 5 Dollars to hike. There are plenty of places to eat after as Monadnock is close to Keene.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344871467000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343927784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Mt.
