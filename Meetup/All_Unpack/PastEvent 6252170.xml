<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's meet at Cambridge Common, located near Harvard Square on Mass Ave. For a map of the park, visit &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; and type in &amp;quot;Cambridge Common.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 5:00 and throw the ball around while getting to know each others' names. If we have enough people, we'll get a game going! Check our About Us page for a list of game rules. If people are flexible with their time we can get some ice cream or grab drinks afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking in metered locations is free on Sunday. For those who take public transportation, the Harvard T stop and the 66 bus stop are a couple blocks away. Send me a note if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189228070000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188243868000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag Football on Cambridge Common</name><id>6252170</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188766800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6252170/</event_url></item>
