Father Peter is the co-director of the Order of Christ-Sophia and is a Master Teacher in every sense.  Every time I attend one of his seminars I learn something about myself, I learn how to live more peacefully, and I feel the joy of being in the presence of a Teacher who is truly loving.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to learn more about Father Peter, or hear some of his previous talks, please visit his website at &lt;a href="http://www.askfatherpeter.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.askfatherp...&lt;/a&gt;.  Give yourself a tremendous gift and come join us.  This seminar will be held from 10 - 2 and a light lunch is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace be with you,&lt;br /&gt;Shakur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death and Rebirth&lt;br /&gt;Most Christian religions teach that we have but one life and that human beings are endowed with an immortal Spirit. In contrast, we teach the Cosmic Law of Rebirth.  This Law states that we learn the lessons of existence in the material world in one lifetime after another.  If we do not master conditions in one life, we simply repeat the lesson in the next life until it is mastered.  In time, every one of us will develop our divine potential.  Join us in a discussion of this Cosmic Law and how it relates to your current life.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542502000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193880139000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar: Death and Rebirth</name><id>6653127</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194706800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/6653127/</event_url></item>
