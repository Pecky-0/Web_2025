The young son of A.A.Milne was born 21 Aug 1920. At the age of one, the boy received a stuffed bear as a present and later accumulated a menagerie of other stuffed animals, inspiring his now famous father to write stories about him and his collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's gather outside in Davis Square to see if we can find inspiration outdoors, and if there happen to be some interesting children, shirted bears, or tiny piglets running around, we can certainly write about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to bring paper and pencils or pens instead of laptops since we won't be near power, but it's up to you. It looks like Mother Nature is with us, but if she bails, we'll be in Blue Shirt as usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>3324571</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345660014000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341599016000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Writer's Meetup: Exercise Night!</name><id>dsqtbdyqlbcc</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345589100000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/72230712/</event_url></item>
