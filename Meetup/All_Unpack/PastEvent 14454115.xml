It specializes in seafood but also has steak and prime rib choices. We will attend during Restaurant Week. The 3-course prix fixe menu costs $33. (+tax &amp;amp; tip) There are 3 appetizers, 4 entrees (mahi mahi, salmon, shrimp and prime rib) and 2 desserts to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.restaurantweekboston.com/?neighborhood=waterfront&amp;amp;meal=any" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.restaurant...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not interested in the prix fixe, you may order off the regular menu. Please bring cash, if possible, as we won't get individual tabs. We'll begin with our usual cocktail hour from 6:00-7:00 in the lounge and then go to our table for dinner shortly after 7:00. The Aquarium T-stop is right next to the Marriott and the restaurant has valet parking. Please join us for an elegant meal in a waterfront setting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: RSVP's are only being accepted for this event on Sunday 8/22, Monday 8/23 and up to 4:00 PM on Tuesday 8/24.
