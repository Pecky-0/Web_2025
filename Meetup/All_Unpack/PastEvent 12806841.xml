After listening to the music I think this is going to be a wonderful and interesting show! Closer to the date I will send some premeetup information! Make sure and check out the sound!!! &lt;br /&gt;Jenn  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://lala.com/z6dCI" target="_blank"&gt;http://lala.com/z6dCI...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mon 4/12 &lt;br /&gt;18+ $9 - Tickets on sale 2/19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those bands that seem like they'd blow your mind live. Such a huge and layered sound made by only two guys. Take the time to watch the vids on their page especially the one at the bottom where the drummer is drumming on the dude's double neck guitar while he's playing it. These guys refuse to except the conventional limitations of their instruments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Winning the prize for the most technically impressive band I've seen this year was L.A.'s El Ten Eleven. Dunn was often playing guitar and bass simultaneously on his double-necked guitar while his foot moved in a blur across effects and looping pedals. The coordination and precision was breathtaking without straying into gimmickry.&amp;quot; DenverPost.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It might sound delusional to say the dude in El Ten Eleven is playing bass in a way that's never been done before, but if you've seen these guys live, you know it's not out of the question.&amp;quot; Arizona Daily Star &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/elteneleven" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will give out my number closer to the show. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jenn</member_name><member_id>10142965</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271290079000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267972187000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>El Ten Eleven @ The Middle East Upstairs</name><id>12806841</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271116800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/12806841/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/b/f/global_13497007.jpeg</photo_url></item>
