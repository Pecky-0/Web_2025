&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you frustrated at the abundance of single people in Boston, and yet the &lt;strong&gt;lack of connection&lt;/strong&gt; you feel with most of them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you like to be able to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;attract a partner for dating or a relationship?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered "yes" to either of these questions, then you're going to love our upcoming seminar. &amp;nbsp;It's all about how to use "the law of attraction" to draw your perfect partner to you like a magnet. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I realize that might sound like a bunch of new age magical thinking, but I can assure you that it's as predictable as gravity once you know how to do it. &amp;nbsp;This is one of my big secrets, and I've been using it with success for many years to attract whatever kind of partner I desire. &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;And the good news is that you can too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*************************************************&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

HERE'S A SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'LL LEARN: *************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you keep attracting the wrong kind of people into your life and what you can do about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you should do after you have a bad date (the answer might surprise you).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My proven process for becoming clear on exactly what kind of partner you want to attract (this also works for attracting friends, business colleagues, jobs, roommates, etc.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REVEALED: &amp;nbsp;A simple 5-word sentence that instantly stops you from attracting the wrong kind of people and makes it easy to meet the kind of people you really want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new strategy to use when going to social events that makes it much easier to meet and attract someone who is a match for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll walk away from this event feeling much clearer about the kind of people you want to meet, and you'll know what to do next in order to draw them into your life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*************************************************&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

PERSONALITY FEEDBACK&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

*************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's just the first part of the seminar! Then we will go into one of the most popular activities that we do in this social skills group...&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;personality feedback!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will have an opportunity to participate in small group evaluations of other members, and you'll also get to experience what it's like to receive both positive encouragement and constructive feedback about how you come across to others. This is often the most revealing part of the workshop, because it's so personalized. &amp;nbsp;After all, when you meet that perfect someone, you want to put your best foot forward, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some members became aware of things they were doing for years that were turning people off, and some learned that they come across much better than they realized (which dramatically boosted their confidence in all social situations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;I want you to know that exercise is done very gently, kindly, and in the spirit of personal growth. We are all there to help each other. So if this section makes you a little nervous, don't let it. I promise that you will find this to be one of the most educational and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enjoyable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;parts of the seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*************************************************&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

HOW TO GET INVOLVED&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

*************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is it? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The seminar is conveniently located in Harvard Square, less than 5 minutes walk from the red line. Please plan on arriving by 2:45pm so you have time to settle in and meet the other members. We start promptly at 3:00 and go until 5:00 (with a break in the middle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Cheap. &amp;nbsp;If you took a class like this through an adult education center, you'd easily pay more than $50 to attend, and&amp;nbsp;that's assuming there even&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;a class that could offer you all this, which there isn't. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other class offers you this kind of cutting edge information plus the ability to get personality feedback. &amp;nbsp;What if one small change is all it takes to immediately and effortlessly begin attracting high-quality friends and dating prospects into your life? &amp;nbsp;I've seen it happen many times in this group, and it can happen for you too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how much?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because I want to help as many people as I can, I've decided to keep the price very affordable so that anyone who wants to come will be able to. &amp;nbsp;The cost for this event is only $25, which is very low considering the quality of training that you'll be getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it...&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;that's 83 cents a day for a month&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;What else do you spend 83 cents on every day that makes no difference in your social life (or love life) whatsoever? I promise that this will be well worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is the class?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In order to make sure I can personally help as many people as possible, the class is limited to the first 30 people who RSVP. &amp;nbsp;We're going to be moving around and doing lots of fun exercises, so I have to limit the size. &amp;nbsp;There are over 800 people seeing this message, so be&amp;nbsp;sure to put in your RSVP right now in order to lock in your spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$25 cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great attitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a willingness to learn fun, new things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and put in your RSVP right now in order to secure your spot. &amp;nbsp;I'm looking forward to seeing you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warmly,&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
