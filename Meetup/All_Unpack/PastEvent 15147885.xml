Roots and Wings Healing Arts Center and Ann are co-sponsoring this event for all who wish to participate. We're sharing this opportunity and experience with you, as it is always an easy way to align and to feel gooooood!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did these meditations on Oct. 15th at Acara Yoga, and, once again, everyone LOVED it!  This time I'll be doing them at Roots and Wings, in Natick.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Here's the selection:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Standing Tree meditation&lt;/u&gt;: When you'll become one with the soul of a tree and experience all of the resources for life that it can bring you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Connecting to the &amp;quot;Core Value Offer of Your Being&amp;quot;, with a Sacred Journey Meditation:&lt;/u&gt; Align with who you want to be in the world and what you have to offer and bringing it into all the aspects of your life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spirit's Kisses:&lt;/u&gt; Experience the presence of Spirit all around you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;Join us to experience magnificent feelings of peace, love, happiness and hope- essentially feeling really, really good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***If you like, you can bring a mat, blanket, and pillow to fully relax lying down. Or you can use the chairs provided, too, of course. Please arrive a little early to get settled (around 7:05).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;All are welcome. The class is appropriate whether you are a beginner to meditating, or experienced. Please invite others to sign up and join you! Forward this to your friends, family and groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Space is limited, so either RSVP'ing thru this site, or registration is required. Non- meetup people should register by sending name, e-mail, and phone number to: annide@newpossibilitiescoaching.com. They’ll receive confirmation of their registration and a reminder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;I generally struggle with being in a quiet space and being present; but tonight’s class helped me channel positive energy and feel good about who I am.”  Michele G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&amp;quot;Ann's guided meditations are a rare opportunity for me to intentionally dream.  The hour or so of deliberate peace and good feelings have become a treasured respite for me.  With Ann's assistance, I find myself able to relax and focus on my mind, body, spirit and thoughts.  I leave there renewed and inspired every time!&amp;quot;  Charlene Frary[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be on the first floor, in the Wings studio</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289229253000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287422730000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE Evening of Guided Meditations for the Community </name><id>15147885</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1289085300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up/events/15147885/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/4/global_5412564.jpeg</photo_url></item>
