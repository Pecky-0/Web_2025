The &lt;a href="http://wapacktrailrace.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MorFun Wapack Trail Race&lt;/a&gt; covers 21 miles of rocky, mountainous terrain in southern NH and western MA, with about 6,000 feet of elevation gain.  There are also 42 and 50 mile options for the ultra-tastic amongst you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are about 6 aid stations along the route, with a variety of food and drink.  I would recommend having done at least a half marathon and some trail running previously.  I've hiked this trail before, and it's very nice scenery -- basically a series of small mountains protruding from the forest, with some great outlooks towards Mt. Monadnock.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can register at &lt;a href="http://wapacktrailrace.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://wapacktrailrac...&lt;/a&gt; .  Please read all the logistical information there carefully. I'll be driving out from the Porter Square area for the start of the 21 miler if anyone would like to carpool.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Paul Lewicke</member_name><member_id>4934046</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242040147000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233167506000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wapack Trail Race (21, 42, or 50 miles)</name><id>9620337</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241866800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/9620337/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
