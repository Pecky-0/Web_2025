Years later, a supremely arrogant young Pip boards the coach to London where, by the grace of a mysterious benefactor, he will join the ranks of the idle rich and &amp;quot;become a gentleman.&amp;quot; Finally, in the luminous mists of the village at evening, Pip the man meets Estella, his dazzingly beautiful tormentor, in a ruined garden--and lays to rest all the heartaches and illusions that his &amp;quot;great expectations&amp;quot; have brought upon him. Dickens's biographer, Edgar H. Johnson, has said that--except for the author's last-minute tampering with his original ending--&amp;quot;Great Expectations is &amp;quot;the most perfectly constructed and perfectly written of all Dickens's works.&amp;quot; In John Irving's Introduction to this edition, the novelist takes the view that Dickens's revised ending is &amp;quot;far more that mirror of the quality of trust in the novel as a whole.&amp;quot; Both versions of the ending are printed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please bring your a book or 2 or 3 to swap!
