To learn more about the victims of this particularly tragic (because particularly preventable) form of childhood suffering, please visit:&lt;ul&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.childrenshealthcare.org/victims.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.childrensh...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/4/625" target="_blank"&gt;http://pediatrics.aap...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Administration/George_Street_Journal/vol26/26GSJ24g.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.brown.edu/...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that at no time will any participant in this event be trespassing on Christian Science property -- this is all to take place on the public thoroughfare, Massachusetts Avenue.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tentative plan is to assemble on Mass Ave in order to begin the two-hour demonstration march by 11 AM. Persons interested in participating in the mock funeral should wear black clothing, and will be carrying picket signs. Other members will be asked to engage passersby in discussion and to distribute informational materials -- this is not just a publicity stunt, but is rather meant to alert the public to the reality that much suffering has been caused by medical neglect of a religious kind, and by the failure of prosecutors and legislators to take appropriate action on behalf of child victims.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be breaking around 1:30 for lunch, and will then reassemble by 3 PM at which time the attendees of the Christian Science annual meeting will begin to emerge from the Mother Church.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tentatively scheduled is a press conference to take place at 12:30, at the same location; arrangements are being made to have adult survivors of Christian Science medical abuse on hand to share their story with the media. As I receive more details from the event organizer, I will update this event description.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I can be reached at 617-935-4951</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245282444000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240096406000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Demonstration at Church of Christ, Scientist</name><id>10215164</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244473200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/10215164/</event_url></item>
