This looks like one of the largest and best cornfield mazes in Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;Since I've never been here, not really sure where we can meet but I'll e-mail the group at LEAST a week before the event with that info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the websight:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DavisMegaMaze.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are: $16.95 for ages 13-59 and $12.95 for kids 5-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it rains that day or the night before they might be closed so the rain date will be the following day. (Sunday the 19th) Same time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a day of fun we can go for some lunch. I don't know Sterling at all but I'll have a GPS that can list local places to eat or we can just go back towards Worcester for lunch (maybe Finder's Pub?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't set a limit on the RSVP's So if you're unsure you can make it (maybe),  RSVP the day before the event.&lt;br /&gt;That's why the &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; isn't an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or ideas for future fall events e-mail me or you can call me at:&lt;br /&gt; (508) 212-4111&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>3673693</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224531673000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220826436000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Davis' MEGA Cornfield Maze</name><id>8709863</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224342000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/8709863/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/6/f/global_5458719.jpeg</photo_url></item>
