Her former clients and collaborators include the Somerville Arts Council, NYC-based artist Christine Wong, and various designers from around the world. In 2008, she merged her passion for writing with her love of fashion to form a blog. She currently blogs at Un-stitched, where she shares her discoveries of emerging designers, fashion illustrators, and social networks built around fashion. Christine originally began blogging when she saw a disconnect between emerging designers and a potential customer base. Since then, she has created relationships with other bloggers and designers, and has successfully navigated the social networking phenomenon which connects brands to their customers. Her most recent interviews and articles for Un-stitched have been featured on Kickstarter.com, Smashingdarling.com and Heartifb.com. Christine holds a BA from Boston University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan</member_name><member_id>2523024</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>yasu</member_name><member_id>3356319</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer Ngo</member_name><member_id>9863902</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288876537000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>fashionandmusic</urlname><id>1390310</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Fashion and Music Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287066114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fashion and Music Marketing and The  Fashion and Music 2010 Initiative</name><id>sgzdpynpbdb</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288735200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fashionandmusic/events/15107592/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/1/6/global_12633862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
