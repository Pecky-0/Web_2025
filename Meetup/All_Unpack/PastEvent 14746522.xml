Breakheart Reservation is a 640-acre hardwood forest with jagged, rocky outcroppings, two fresh-water lakes, and a rambling section of the Saugus River. Seven rocky hills, over 200 feet high, provide vistas of Boston, southern New Hampshire and central Massachusetts. An extensive trail system through the woodlands guides visitors to various areas of the reservation. Fishing in Silver and Pearce Lakes, hiking the trails and birdwatching by the Saugus River are popular year-round activities. The supervised swimming area at Pearce Lake, one of the few fresh- water swimming spots north of Boston, draws crowds in the summer. In addition to its natural resources, the reservation has a rich cultural history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Programs&lt;br /&gt;Rangers conduct year-round programs that interpret the plant and animal life of the woods and ponds as well as reservation management issues and cultural themes of the reservation's past. In the summer, most programs begin at the Pearce Lake swimming area. Many of the programs are suitable for children. Special school programs are offered in the spring.  Metro North Region Programs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camp Nihan offers camping and day use throughout the year for schools and non-profit groups with a permit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;From north or south: Take Rte. 1 to Lynn Fells Parkway exit, follow Lynn Fells Parkway a short distance, take a right onto Forest Street.
