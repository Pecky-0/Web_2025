They will be serving Hors d 'oeuvres the first hour on the evening.  So, please get there as early as you can. Steve Ob1. will do his best to try an introduce you to everyone at our tables. If you are late? introductions become very difficult. Because there is no one at out tables to introduce you too. They are all up dancing. So, please get there as early as possible. Also, if late, the parking lots have only around 250 cars parking spots, and with almost 400 singles attending, bring your walking shoes, if late. Cause late people will be parking a good distance from the Dance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Steve Ob1. or Meetup at the door as you pay, &amp; the Meetup signs on our tables.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357052479000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>SocialFun</urlname><id>950281</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353940432000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Years Eve Singles Dance</name><id>92845322</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>18000000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357002000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SocialFun/events/92845322/</event_url></item>
