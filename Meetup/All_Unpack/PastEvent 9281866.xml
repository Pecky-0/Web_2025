These vaccinations include: DHLPP, Bordatella (canine cough) and Rabies. Please ensure that your dog is healthy and current on vaccinations prior to attending the meetup. If you have questions about this, please do not hesitate to let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily McHugh </member_name><member_id>6348089</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235335043000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>18</count></rating><group><who>small Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-41</urlname><id>404601</id><group_lat>41.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>The North Attleboro Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>41</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228425863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Small Doggie FUN! </name><id>9281866</id><headcount>43</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232913600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-41/events/9281866/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/c/global_1388764.jpeg</photo_url></item>
