<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Do you live in the Allston area?  Do you need a little courage to put on the running shoes and hit the streets?  Well, what are you doing Tuesday night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have returned from traveling and am relatively healthy, I am starting an Allston winter running group.  The idea is to meet weekly in Allston for a casual run on Tuesday nights.  Pending the group, we can split off to do different distances and paces if desired.  Feel free to show up one week or every week, though I'd like to get a core reliable group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where?  My apartment, 1302 Commonwealth Ave.  Initially, we can meet at my apartment building so we have shelter if it's cold to stretch (we can stretch in my lobby), though I'm open to suggestions for future meeting spots.  I am right across the street from the Griggs Street/Long Ave stop on the B Green Line, and 1 block away from CVS towards BC.  I'm 3 blocks away the Harvard Ave/Comm Ave intersection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who?  Open to all, but convenient for those in the Allston/Brighton area or people on the B-Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When? 7pm, Tuesday nights.  We start running at 7pm, so you should be at my apartment building before for stretching - I will plan on being downstairs at 6:50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's the route? It all depends.  I plan to run between 3-6 miles, depending on who shows up.  It's basically a game time decision.  If you show up, you will not be forced to run alone no matter your pace (as long as it's a running speed).  We'll break off into 2 or more people per group and choose routes and speeds, or collectively run.  If you want to come and run at your own pace/distance but want people to help drag you out into the cold, feel free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to contact me with any questions for concerns.  If you are planning on coming and would like my phone #, just email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Guy shivering in tights</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234022749000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233007959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Allston Winter Denial Run (weekly)</name><id>9606614</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233705600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/9606614/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
