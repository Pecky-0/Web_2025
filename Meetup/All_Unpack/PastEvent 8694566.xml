Walsh Theater at Suffolk University&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are intolerance, violence and war so deeply ingrained in religion? Constantine's Sword, the latest film by Oscar-nominated documentarian Oren Jacoby, follows James Carroll, Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence at Suffolk University, Boston Globe columnist, and author of the forthcoming book Practicing Catholic, in his search for answers to this question. Looking to his own past and that of his religion, Carroll addresses the darker side of Christianity and explores the consequences of the religion's influence on United States foreign policy. In what ways can religion inspire us to be better people? How can it lead us astray? And where do we, as a society, draw the lines between our religion and public life? James Carroll joins us to screen the film and address the blessings and perils of religion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235658853000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220621027000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>James Carroll discusses "Constantine's Sword"</name><id>8694566</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225405800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/8694566/</event_url></item>
