Disc-Golf, in essence, is golf played with a frisbee where the &amp;quot;cups&amp;quot; are large chain baskets.  Keith has a number of discs that I am hoping to be able to use, so hopefully, members will not need to provide their own.  The game can be played with regular frisbees, though, so feel free to bring any that you have.  This is our first experience playing disc golf, but the learning curve should be fun to manage.  If you want to learn more about the game, there are a number of resources that can be reached from the park's website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The course should take 2.5-3 hours to complete, and attendees are encouraged to bring lunch.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219680861000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216607237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Disc Golf in Topsfield</name><id>8379003</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219503600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/8379003/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/1/7/global_4871655.jpeg</photo_url></item>
