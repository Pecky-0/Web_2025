It's about a half hour long, free, outdoors (dress warmly!) and afterward you can rent skates to take the ice yourself or bring your own. My sister is the director and also a performer (she is amazing btw!) The skaters are accomplished local competitors and coaches. Some of the performers stay on the ice so you might get some tips on skating. They usually serve hot cider or cocoa or something and there is also a cash snack bar there. It's near Kendall Square T stop and next to an indoor paid parking garage. This has absolutely nothing to do with Mandarin but it will be fun! Happy Winter!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324234454000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323574468000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Off-Topic: Kendall Rink Opening Ice Show!
