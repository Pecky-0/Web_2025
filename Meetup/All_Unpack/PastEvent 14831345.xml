It had been mostly ignored, pre-satellite days as they were, and there were bigger things going on in Europe to take up the front page of the newspaper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't appear to have any storms coming in on Tuesday, but we'll have exercises and writing prompts to try to kick up a storm of ideas. Hopefully we won't cause any destruction or power outages, but we may get moving mentally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's getting dark earlier, the Equinox is Wednesday, so we'll meet inside this week unless it's particularly warm and people want to move outside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any ideas for exercises, send an email with them to Sarah ahead of time, or bring them with you. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>3324571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285171302000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284994234000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Storms of ideas</name><id>14831345</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285109100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/14831345/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
