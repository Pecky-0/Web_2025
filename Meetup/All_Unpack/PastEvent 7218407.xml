I did some checking around tonight and there is a Not Your Average Joes at the intersection of 16 and 28. It's behind the Starbucks (across for the Kappy's towards in an easterly direction).  The strip mall with Walgreens essentially. It's also right next to the T stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember if you are new, you have to pass a belay test before you can climb. They have classes and everything so please just check with the gym in advance.  There is also a shuttle service from the Wellington T stop. If you all have any questions, please drop me a note. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be hanging out at the picnic table sporting a orange Jane Goodall shirt. I like to monkey around at the gym ... :o) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great week and hope to see some of you Friday!&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2680784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202434412000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201578727000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pizza, beer and rocks</name><id>7218407</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1201910400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/7218407/</event_url></item>
