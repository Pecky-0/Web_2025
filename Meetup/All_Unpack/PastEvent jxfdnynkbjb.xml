What opportunities are lost?  What are you creating &amp;amp; not creating?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eckhart Tolle's book &amp;quot;The Power of Now&amp;quot; has certainly jolted the world into an intense awareness of the Power of being in the present moment, the here and now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ann Ide, BostonLOA member &amp;amp; New Possibilities Life Coach&lt;/b&gt;, will facilitate our discussion in the following:&lt;br /&gt;• What does it mean to be &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; in the NOW? &lt;br /&gt;• How do you take moments in the day, make them “delicious” &amp;amp; attract more of what you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann will also guide us through 2 powerful meditations to be fully in the NOW &amp;amp; ease into the flow of easier manifestation.
