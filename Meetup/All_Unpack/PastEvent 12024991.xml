(I tried over a week ago anticipating our numbers!) There is also another group planning to attend on this night. The manager suggests that we all arrive later than the original plan and they will accommodate our party in the room where the band will play. Everyone who has signed up for dinner should plan to meet in the lobby by 8:45. If the later time effects your dinner plans please change your response so I can give them an accurate number for dinner when I get there. I will try to be there by 8:30 to get things rolling. Also...when ordering please tell your server you would like the check written by individual tables so we can more easily determine our tabs. Keep in mind tax and gratuity when paying the bill. Thanks for your cooperation. I am looking forward to a great night. It will be fun to see so many new and familiar faces. Happy New Year to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join friends and dance to Four on the Floor at the China Blossom in North Andover. This was a nice time and well attended last year inspite of the bad weather we had. China Blossom has a buffet and there is no cover for those who have dinner before before 9:30. Otherwise, there is a $20 cover charge for New Year's Eve. The evening includes a champagne toast. Please put in your response if you will attend for dinner so appropriate reservations can be made in advance. Last day to reply for dinner will be Sunday December 27th. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chinablossom.com/new.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.chinabloss...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262817897000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>17</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
