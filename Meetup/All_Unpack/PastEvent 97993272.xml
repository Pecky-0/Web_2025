I plan to ski for a couple of hours and then have lunch in the lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who may be new to XC skiing or who have not been on skis in a while are welcome. We will not leave you behind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windblown is the ultimate New England cross country ski experience with a wonderful lodge, bring your lunch or buy it there (I'm pretty sure they will have the cafe fully open but call to be sure if you are not bringing lunch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll start at 10 am and will be just outside the lodge at the ski rack ready to ski. I'll be wearing a navy blue jacket that says SWIX on it and will start skiing at 10:10. Arrive in time to buy your trail pass and get ready to ski before we meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow at least 1.5 hours driving time from the Boston area. Trail passes are $18--CASH OR CHECK ONLY. Rentals available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact each other for carpooling you can use the discussion board!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>2015761</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357596807000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357356648000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Windblown XC Ski</name><id>97993272</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357484400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/97993272/</event_url></item>
