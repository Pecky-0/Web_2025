These occupy nearly an acre of specially built interior walls that have been installed—per LeWitt’s own specifications—over three stories of a historic mill building situated at the heart of MASS MoCA’s campus. The 27,000-square-foot structure, known as Building #7, has been fully restored for the exhibition by Bruner/Cott &amp;amp; Associates architects, which has closely integrated the building into the museum’s main circulation plan through a series of elevated walkways, a dramatic new vertical lightwell, and new stairways.&lt;br /&gt;     The works in the exhibition are on loan from numerous private and public collections worldwide, including the Yale University Art Gallery, to which LeWitt designated the gift of a major representation of his wall drawings, as well as his wall-drawing archive.&lt;br /&gt;     Jock Reynolds, the Henry J. Heinz II Director of the Yale University Art Gallery, states, “Watching this grand installation of Sol LeWitt’s wall drawings progress over the past six months has been nothing short of thrilling. In addition to providing an enduring exhibition of great beauty, this retrospective will enable visitors to behold for the first time the full trajectory of a major aspect of Sol’s artistic career. Until today, the only way to view multiple LeWitt wall drawings has been to travel far and wide, pursuing them individually in situ or in temporary museum exhibitions. Now, visitors will be able to return to MASS MoCA again and again to experience this visual feast of Sol’s wall drawings in a single location, doing so at their leisure over the next twenty-five years.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.artidea.org/event.php?id=279" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.artidea.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=27" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massmoca.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking&lt;br /&gt;In addition to street parking, there is a conveniently located garage: Chapel York Garage at 150 York Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HMMM, maybe we will need to take a road trip to MASS MoCA in North Adams MA in the near future. :- ]&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meet in lobby entrance at 2:40, will wear bw scarf with piano keys</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy M</member_name><member_id>6563416</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276607408000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Arts  lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Arts-Cultural-Events</urlname><id>1343414</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Arts &amp; Creative Cultural Events</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270060908000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sol LeWitt: Transforming Art with Conceptual Ideas</name><id>13049916</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276369200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Arts-Cultural-Events/events/13049916/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/a/b/global_14048475.jpeg</photo_url></item>
