It actually isn't on the Blackstone's website, no idea of cost.  Meet before hand to get a corner and maybe a chair or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover is $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Abe's suggestion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys were great live, it's a salsa fusion band. I have seen them at Newport Blues Cafe So we may be able to practice what we learn on Friday at Monet...lol&lt;br /&gt;They have got a show coming up right around the corner in both time and space:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blackstone&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, January 16 - 9 pm&lt;br /&gt;1005 Main Street - Pawtucket, RI&lt;br /&gt;www.blackstoneclub.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It'll be our first appearance at the the Blackstone since the Planet Groove days, and the evening promises an awesome show. We're excited to say that the award-winning Route .44 will be sharing the bill with us. So if you missed the chance to get a ticket to tonight's event please come out next Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abe</member_name><member_id>9044742</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263864849000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263222420000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Santa Mamba Band feat.
