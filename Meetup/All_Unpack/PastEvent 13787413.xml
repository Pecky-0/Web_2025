Let's get together and celebrate it at the Petit Robert Bistro in Needham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be great fun if each person brought along the name of some major institution or symbol that they would personally like to storm/destroy/reinvent and is prepared to tell us why. It should make for interesting conversation. But it's not a requirement! Just bring along your appetite -- and maybe a French dictionary or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, your $3 reservation fee will be added into the tax and tip portion of the bill and credited to you when I add everything up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation is in Kathy Rotchford's name</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281222547000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276451882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bastille Day Dinner at Petit Robert Bistro</name><id>13787413</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279143000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/13787413/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/b/5/global_15685205.jpeg</photo_url></item>
