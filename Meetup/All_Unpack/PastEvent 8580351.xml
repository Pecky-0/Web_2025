Let's rock the other players at the long-standing, and unlikely to be discontinued, Wednesday night Stump Team Trivia at Union Station Brewery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think you aren't good at trivia?  Do you watch TV?  Movies? Listen to Music?  Eat? Good at History? Geography?  Everyone knows something about the world and can make a great contribution to the game as well as to the conversations around the tables while we play.  Come on out, socialize with the easiest group of people you'll ever make friends with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game starts at 8:30 and usually runs for about 2 hours.  I'll be there around 8:15 to get table(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a meetup sign on a table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220990788000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219192648000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A New Place for Trivia @ Union Station</name><id>8580351</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220486400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/8580351/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
