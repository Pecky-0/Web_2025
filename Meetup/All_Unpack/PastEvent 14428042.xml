This new adaptation blends the lyrical whimsy of Alice with high-octane physical theater and the dynamic vision of acclaimed Hungarian director János Szász (Mother Courage, Marat/Sade, The Seagull). The result is a fresh, funny, and emotional remix of Carroll's classic coming-of-age tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info: &lt;a href="http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/alice-vs-wonderland" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.americanre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge has gotten better and better, and I ended up getting season tickets because everything they are doing this year looks fantastic. &lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE: I already have my ticket, since I have season tickets, so we won't be able to sit together as a group (unless you decide to buy tickets together), I just wanted to see if people wanted to join me. There is no group rate. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUYING YOUR OWN TICKET IN ADVANCE, RSVP-ing here does not guarantee attendance! Tickets are now on sale. Showtime is 2 p.m. &lt;/b&gt; If there is interest, we might have dinner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture and plan to be there at least half an hour before showtime </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anna</member_name><member_id>404606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286852999000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281886292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Alice vs. Wonderland at A.R.T. in Cambridge</name><id>14428042</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286645400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14428042/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/5/global_17195829.jpeg</photo_url></item>
