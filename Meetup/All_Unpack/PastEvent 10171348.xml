<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Bombay Club does a pretty good buffet on a Sunday. I think it's one of the best curry houses in MA. It's in the same building as Wagamama and Staples. Go through the doors in the centre of the building and take the stairs to the second floor, and then walk back to the front of the building. There is also a new Shabu place on the same level. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of Vegetarian options. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's good value at $11.95 (from memory), and the place has a pretty good location with a view of Harvard Sq and JFK Street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's often pretty busy, so I will book at a table when I have an indication of how many people are coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://aussie.meetup.com/145/pages/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call me on 857 207 9044 if you need directions.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240939785000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239579570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Curry-Please note change of time from 2pm to 1pm. </name><id>10171348</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240765200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/10171348/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/1/global_8126801.jpeg</photo_url></item>
