I'm sorry, I forget who it was! But when I looked up Cat Rock on Google, it looked really nice and got very good reviews. It's trails around a pond, plus some big open areas; not fenced in, but far from any traffic. There are some lovely pictures of the area you can find easily on Google. I have set the date for the Sunday of Columbus Day weekend, but if that's hard for too many people, we could change it! Just tell me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karla Rab</member_name><member_id>10717717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350245457000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349386473000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Explore Cat Rock in Weston.</name><id>85541712</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350234000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/85541712/</event_url></item>
