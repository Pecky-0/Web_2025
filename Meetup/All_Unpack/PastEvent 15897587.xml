Since it is showing upstairs, I will grab a table at the top of the escalator near the windows.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group going in, we generally gather in the hall, outside the room the movie was shown in to discuss the movie a bit, allow for bathroom breaks and to get a head count of all those interested in going out after.     Now that the Rockbottom has closed for renovations, I am not sure exactly where we will go after, but there are lots of places in the area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie details: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: January 21, 2011  &lt;br /&gt;Studio: Paramount Pictures  &lt;br /&gt;Director: Ivan Reitman  &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Elizabeth Meriwether  &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Ashton Kutcher, Natalie Portman, Greta Gerwig, Kevin Kline, Ophelia Lovibond, Ben Lawson, Chris Bridges, Olivia Thirlby, Jake M.
