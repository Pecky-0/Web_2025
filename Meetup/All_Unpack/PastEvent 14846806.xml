<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Well, I've been dying to setup a hike at Musquash once the bug season ended and it's finally here! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park at the end of Hickory Hill Drive and head straight in to reach the trail entrance---- we can meet under the power lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to the trail head entrance on Hickory Hill Drive: When heading north towards Manchester, on Mammoth Road, take a left onto Shasta Drive (a country store with a Dunkin Donuts sign is right there). Stay on Shasta until it ends (about 1.2 miles) and take a left onto High Range Road. Stay on only short time, (about .3 miles) and take first street on right - Hickory Hill Drive. Go to the end of it and park .... trail head is right in front of where parking is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like it if we could meet a little ways away from parking - under the power lines - so the dogs don't interfere with others and we don't cause too much congestion in the surrounding neighborhood. The power lines are right before you get into the woods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can do The Betty Mac Trail which has been taking about an hour for Beau and I, probably about 1.5-2 hours with a group....&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet under the power lines before trail head entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285434425000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285091022000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Musquash - Hickory Hill Entrance</name><id>14846806</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285428600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/14846806/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/3/global_13504099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
