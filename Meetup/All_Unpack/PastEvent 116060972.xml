&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Event Rating: &lt;span style="color : #ff6600"&gt;Strenuous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Distance: 9 Miles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Time Duration: 4 Hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blaze Orange: &lt;span style="color : #ff6600"&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of the popularity of the NST Hikes, the difficulty of this hike and a maximum number of hikers allowed, this section is only open only to members (No Guests) who have successfully completed at least 5 of the more challenging hikes with the RIHC and are truly interested in completed ALL sections of the NST.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Section 8 of this trail will take us along Old Snake Hill Rd. to where it turns into gravel and leads us into the Killingly Pond Wildlife Management Area. From there we briefly enter into Connecticut and hike around Killingly Pond before we head back into RI and continue on to Rt. 6.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This section is just over 9 miles in length and consists mostly of road either paved or gravel with some parts of it going through forest trail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and crosses through a DEM Wildlife Management area where Hunting Season is in full swing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this section you will need a good pair of waterproof hiking boots, 2 liters of water, snacks and since hunting season is in full swing and all hikers are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff6600"&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to wear a minimum of 200 square inches of blaze orange above their waist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow members and only sign up for this section if you are considering completing the entire NST, in great hiking shape and are definitely committed to attending this hike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, you must be willing use your vehicle to car shuttle from the meetup location to the start of the hike and later back following the hike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
