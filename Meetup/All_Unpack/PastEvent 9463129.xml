<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please Note:&lt;/b&gt; There will be a guest speaker at this screening. The founder of the New England Innocence Project will lead a discussion after the film. The New England Innocence Project (&amp;quot;NEIP&amp;quot;) provides pro bono legal assistance to inmates who are challenging their wrongful convictions. The organization's mission is to identify, investigate and exonerate wrongfully convicted individuals who are currently incarcerated in New England. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is part of Independent Lens, a monthly film series hosted in partnership with Boston Cares, WGBH, ITVS Community Cinema, Hostelling International, and The Boston Public Library. The Independent Lens series offers preview screenings of films covering a range of current social issues. It is intended to connect communities with organizations and information, and give citizens the opportunity to get involved and will be screened at The Rabb Lecture Hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tulia, Texas&lt;/b&gt; tells the story of an undercover narcotics officer that is hired by the small farming town of Tulia. By the end of the summer of 1999, 46 people are arrested for selling cocaine-nearly all of them African American. At first, it was heralded as one of the biggest drug busts in Texas history, until a team of lawyers exposed  the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directors do a great job of telling a simply complex story about... well... it is either about a small, quiet Texan town that got &amp;quot;sick of the dope dealers&amp;quot; and that wanted to send a message to the black community blamed for the dealing OR it's the story about how justice gets corrupted when people with localized power need money.With another documentary having circled the festival circuit on this topic (Tulia, Texas: Scenes from the Drug War) and a narrative feature from John Singleton on the horizon (with Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry seemingly attached), the war may yet be waged in earnest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a good Thai restaurant across the street where we can go to afterward for our group discussion. Since this is a weeknight event please indicate if  you plan to  go to the restaurant afterward so I can make a fair estimate for our group's reservation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tulia, Texas&lt;/b&gt; will be airing later this month on WGBH. I will be contacting Boston Cares to see if there will be any guest speakers for this screening and will update our event site accordingly.  I'll get to the library early and will try to save seats so we can sit together as a group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is indicative of smart filmmaking in general, this documentary focuses on a few characters whose story paints a nationally familiar, and globally relevant, picture. Tulia is indicative of the communities of the world that haven't changed, where, despite &amp;quot;integration,&amp;quot; the black community still lives on the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; side of the tracks, where it is blamed for many problems that spill over the railway lines.&lt;br /&gt;Moving Pictures Magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to the trailer: &lt;a href="http://www.tuliatexasfilm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tuliatexas...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to  a complete review: &lt;a href="http://film.prostamerika.com/SIFF2008English.html#TULIA" target="_blank"&gt;http://film.prostamer...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This screening is free and open to the public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tom will be holding a meetup sign before and after the film</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231290434000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Social Cinema:Tulia, Texas </name><id>9463129</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233097200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9463129/</event_url></item>
