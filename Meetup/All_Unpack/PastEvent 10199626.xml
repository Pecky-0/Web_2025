<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Sarah brought the following event to my attention and I think it would be a great opportunity to listen to a current successful writer talk about his work and the craft of writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where: Porter Square Books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: Thursday, June 4th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What:  David Sedaris will be here to read from the paperback of When You Are Engulfed in &lt;br /&gt;Flames.  A limited number of tickets &lt;br /&gt;for this event will go on sale Monday, May 4 for $16.80, the &lt;br /&gt;price of the book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best way is for people to try and get themselves a ticket and then we can all meet up together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Alexa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>out front</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244586550000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239903462000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>David Sedaris Reading</name><id>10199626</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244156400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/10199626/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
