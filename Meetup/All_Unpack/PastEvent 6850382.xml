The most expensive Egyptian film ever made, The Yacoubian Building is a sprawling, star-studded epic that spans the social stratosphere of contemporary Cairo. In three fast-moving hours, the film dramatizes such issues as adultery, political corruption, terrorism, and homosexuality. Based on Alaa Al Aswani?s novel, first-time director Marwan Hamed crafts a gripping drama set in a downtown Cairo apartment building: an aging playboy represents a vanishing world of gentility, a French singer pines for his former love, and a pretty young girl is disillusioned. The growing influence of Islam is dramatized through two controversial storylines: the doorman?s son, frustrated in his attempts to move up in society, turns to religious fanaticism and ends up training for jihad in a desert camp, while the religious piety of a businessman who has risen from a shoeshine boy is exposed as a sham that hides only self-interest. Description adapted from the Tribeca Film Festival 2006. In Arabic with English subtitles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has limited review on RottenTomatoes  &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yacoubian_building/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rottentoma...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;but it is batting 100% &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we'll head up to the Shawarma restaurant on Huntington to discuss the movie.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198699167000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196727869000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie: The Yacoubian Building at MFA</name><id>6850382</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198351800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6850382/</event_url></item>
