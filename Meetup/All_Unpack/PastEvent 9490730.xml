My favorite meal is breakfast but I rarely eat it in the normal morning hours. What about you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most fun aspect of our group is the lack of organization so there is no need to coordinate dishes or let us know what you are bringing - unless you really really want to share. Just believe that it will all work out and it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us this month with your favorit breakfast recipe. But remember part of the fun is thinking a little outside the breakfast box. Pack up the stuff you need and cook onsite.  The kitchen will be filled with people cooking and chatting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the drillâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;Plan to assemble or cook on site unless your dish takes more than an hour to prepare. Bring any special equipment but I have standard kitchen tools and supplies.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>my home so you will notice me and the dogs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1236981968000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231590547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes February Meetup</name><id>9490730</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234569600000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/9490730/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/f/c/global_6899116.jpeg</photo_url></item>
