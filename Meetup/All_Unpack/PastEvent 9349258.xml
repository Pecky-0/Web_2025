For the people who want to meet for dinner - we are planning on meeting at 6:30 at Panera's in Hadley.  Pat from &amp;quot;Spice of Life too short&amp;quot; will be wearing an orange baseball cap and will be holding a small orange sign that says MEETUP.  My picture is posted so you can also look for me.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just going to the movie, look for the orange baseball cap in the line. We plan on being outside the movie theater at the Hampshire Mall around 7:45.  We will be going in the theater shortly after so we can try and get seats together.  Should be a good movie and a great group...one of the largest we have had so far. Remember, it is best to get your movie ticket BEFORE dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dinner at Panera's at 6:30 or outside the movie theater at the Hampshire Mall</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231081859000</updated><rating><average>3.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229468708000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</name><id>9349258</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230422400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/9349258/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/e/global_3300622.jpeg</photo_url></item>
