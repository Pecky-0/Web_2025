I'll be bringing my dog, so we'll stick to the leashed dog side of the beach, and I won't be going through the dunes since dogs are not allowed. Plan on a fairly quick walking pace....18 minute mile? We'll walk for 1.5-2 hours (basically down the beach and back, which is about 4 miles total.&amp;nbsp; Dress accordingly (especially since it will be cooler and windier on the coast...I'd recommend a face shield or neck warmer as well). My schedule that day is such that I won't be able to host any post-walk social gathering, but if anyone wants to step up and organize the group after, feel free :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beach charges admission- $7 per carload I believe, or $4 for members, so you might consider carpooling from the Ipswich train station.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
