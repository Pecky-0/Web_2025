&lt;p&gt;Join us as we explore the subtle Mind-Breath-Body connection, and understand the ways in which we can consciously use our breath to manage our stress, minds and emotions, and ways in which we can be more aware and present. We will also hang around over some tea, post. These sessions are being offered by the Art of Living Foundation, a non-profit organization engaged in service initiatives across 153 countries. So, come, empty your minds, and rejuvenate mid week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No meditation experience required, all are welcome. Please RSVP!&lt;/p&gt;
