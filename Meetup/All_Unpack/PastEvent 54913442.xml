That journey started on October 21, 2006, when the couple boarded their 43ft Cutter &amp;quot;Bahati&amp;quot; in South Freeport Maine to circumnavigate the globe via the &amp;quot;Coconut Milk Run&amp;quot;. Nat and Betsy will share lots of stories and photographs of their adventure &amp;quot;Sailing in Slocum&amp;#146;s Wake: Round the World in Five Years&amp;#148;. Their voyage eventually took nearly 5 years to complete and along the way they encountered challenging weather and visited with some extraordinary people in amazing places. By the time they returned to Maine on June 17, 2011 they had sailed across more than 30,000 miles of open water. Pelagic Sailing Club meets at Savin Hill Yacht Club, Dorchester, MA, on the second floor at 6:30pm for social hour and pizza, 7:30pm for meeting, 8:00pm guest speaker.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robin G.
