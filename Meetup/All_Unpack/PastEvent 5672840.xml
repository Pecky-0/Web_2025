NEXT SUNDAY IS SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF MEMORIAL DAY, SO PLEASE UPDATE YOUR RSVP'S!  (Hammie sez, if nobody comes, can we have the SNACKS??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, we now have a location by default for our next meetup because the promise of covered deck and sight of the ocean never materialized!   Soooo, the next meetup is at MY HOUSE! (it really belongs to the dogs and cats, since there is more of their stuff in the house than there is of mine), for which marvelous occasion I am actually going to rake and mow (FINALLY!) my raggedy looking shady fenced back yard and scrub my kitchen and downstairs bathroom...  go anywhere else in my house at your PERIL!  Sorry for such short notice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of parking available.  Please bring folding chairs if you don't want to sit on the ground.  I have very few outdoor chairs... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodies and fluids will be provided.  DO NOT FEED CLOVIS!  He has a damaged brain stem and has trouble swallowing.  Imagine a Pug who has trouble swallowing!  (He says, awww, Mom, let me die happy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meetup is on the THIRD Sunday of May (the second Sunday is Mother's Day, don't forget!)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The April 2007 meetup was our first meetup of the year, and it was held at Uncle Oscar's pace in Abington, MA.  We missed Uncle Oscar's birthday by a week (it was RAINING on his birthday, so we had to postpone!), but the weather during our meetup Sunday was perfect beyond all expectations.  At least 30 Pugs, 4 French Bulldogs, a Papillon, and a Feist were in attendance, and everyone had a marvelous time.  Uncle Oscar was just a young 'un at this meetup, since Black Magic, a 15 year old rescue Pug was in attendance as well.  Magic went home early (too much excitement!) and Oscar had to be taken inside for a nap in the middle of the proceedings (too much excitement!), but both old gentlement held up extremely well.  As long as he lives, a Pug loves a party, and these Pugs were no exception!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have! If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180902790000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176664059000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug May Meetup</name><id>5672840</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180288800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/5672840/</event_url></item>
