One side is the beach,&lt;br /&gt;when the tide goes out, you can walk out forever in&lt;br /&gt;the shallow warm water looking for hermit crabs,&lt;br /&gt;horseshoe crabs and blue crabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side is a river surrounded by marshlands&lt;br /&gt;and beautiful Cape homes.  Wear water shoes and you&lt;br /&gt;can walk almost the whole river.  Keep a look out for&lt;br /&gt;heron and the snowy egrets nesting the marshes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO MEET*: At the posted time, with 1/2 hour leeway for late-comers.
