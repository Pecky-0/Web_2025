<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Since this was a lot of fun last time, we thoguht we would toss this out again for this weekend.  Same details apply as last time only one difference, we will only be going with white wines in celebration of spring being here, finally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every couple should bring one bottle of wine ($20 and under) and an appetizer or dessert. I don't think any of us want to drink wine on an empty stomach.  We can cook or reheat anything you have if it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will be doing a blind tasting, so we will disguise your bottle and only label the type of wine it is. &lt;/span&gt;Once everyone has had a chance to taste what they wanted, we can pick a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One quick note. We do have a dog (chihuahua) named Bandit. He is very friendly. I just want to make sure that everyone is aware in case anyone has any allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
