The rest have been energetically scrambled by dark forces who do NOT have the best interest of humanity at heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in with the original organic DNA encryption are codes defining embodiments we have on other spiritual planes, as well as keys to unlock known ascension gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the organizer of this group has a strong interest in the health and wellness advantages of regenerating our natural organic DNA encoding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to understand that doing so has everything to do with &lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPIRITUALITY  AND  ASCENSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain Keylontic Science shielding techniques are essential to protect against devistating energetic changes known for eons to be arriving here by Dec 21, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since all other records have had major portions deleted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With remaining portions containing deliberate distortions designed to perpetuate control dogmas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can now understand why the original records needed to be hidden and cloistered so they could be brought back now... when we really need to know the truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These records were preserved by the Melchizedek Cloister Emerald Order (MCEO), described on this link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.azuritepress.com/melchizedek_cloister.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.azuritepre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To view a description of &amp;quot;The Real Christmas Story&amp;quot; which will be played and discussed this time, click on the link below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.azuritepress.com/products_us/chr_hb.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.azuritepre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this time of the year, you will be able to view a reference to this, and a celebration called &amp;quot;Festival of Lights&amp;quot; on the publisher's home page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.azuritepress.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Meetup adjourns at 9:00 PM. Please bring your own refreshments.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case of snow, this will be rescheduled, so be sure to check back on this site for an update before coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Get on I-93 from wherever you are. We are approx. half an hour north of Concord, NH. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get off on exit 22. At the end of the ramp go North on Rt. 127 (toward Gaza). In approx. 1.5 miles you will come to a stop sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn left, going North on Rt 132. Watch for mailbox number 298 on the right side of the road, approx. 1.5 mi. up. A tan building with semi-circular window is across the street, on the left side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go up the first driveway into the property, which has a Meetup sign at the end. Do NOT go up the second driveway which has a sign &amp;quot;ULCS Clinic&amp;quot;. No parking is allowed there, so if you get that far, turn around in that driveway and go back and up the first driveway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter through the front door, where you will see another Meetup sign. No need to knock. Just go on in and down the stairs and have a seat in the classroom. If you are arriving early for a private appointment, have a seat in the waiting room instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meetup sign at end of first driveway and on front door.
