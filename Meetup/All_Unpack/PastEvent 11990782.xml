Given that, and that The Lemonheads are one of my favorite bands ever, I will be at Great Scott in the front row to pay my respects.  Come out, enjoy the show, and feel free to openly mock my adulation for this Boston music legend.  Doors aren't until 9, so we'll likely gather early for beers somewhere nearby.  Details closer to day of show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan Dando (from allmusic):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemonheads singer/guitarist/songwriter (and sometimes drummer) Evan Dando was one of alternative rock's publicized artists during the early '90s, before drugs derailed his career and nearly killed him. Born on March 4, 1967, and raised in the suburbs of Boston, MA, Dando had gravitated towards such influential '80s punk outfits as Hüsker Dü and the Replacements, which led to the formation of the Lemonheads by the mid-'80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2001 saw Dando launch a more extensive solo acoustic tour and issue his first solo full-length release, the in-concert Live at the Brattle Theatre/Griffith Sunset, which equally mixed originals along with covers. Around the same time, Dando joined up with former Smashing Pumpkins members James Iha and Melissa Auf Der Maur (and, allegedly, also Ryan Adams) in a new group, the Virgins. Dando also began laying down the groundwork for his first solo studio full-length. In 2003, Dando surfaced with the beautifully sweet Baby I'm Bored. Guest spots from Ben Lee, ex-Spacehog frontman Royston Langdon, and producer Jon Brion allowed Dando's first solo studio effort to shine. In 2003, Dando reunited the Lemonheads and released an eponymous album. Three years later, the band returned with the Gibby Haynes-produced covers album Varshons. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call/text me on 617-549-8453 to find me and the group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew</member_name><member_id>8828135</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265421907000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259688114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Evan Dando (Lemonheads' front man) @ Great Scott</name><id>11990782</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265248800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/11990782/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/1/global_12537441.jpeg</photo_url></item>
