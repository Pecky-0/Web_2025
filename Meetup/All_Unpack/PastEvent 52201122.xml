<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This will be our second organizational meetup, we will continue the conversation regarding our strategy for Ron Paul and Liberty in the Constitution state. For the time being we'll have these regularly on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month at New England Pizza. N.E.P. works well because we essentially have a whole section to ourselves, but I would like to find a meeting place a little bit more centralized in the state to encourage bigger turnouts, it's just a matter of finding the right location. Looking forward to continuing the discussion!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sara Lynn</member_name><member_id>29188532</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1329878439000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329162570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CT4Paul Social &amp; Organizational Meetup</name><id>52201122</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1329780600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/52201122/</event_url></item>
