&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAY/TIME: &lt;/strong&gt;Saturday, June 4, from 1:00 pm to ????   (Really, we'll stay as late as anybody wants to stay!) Come for an hour   or two; come for the whole afternoon and into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Free parking. Table space and a chair.   Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge,   microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out,   if people are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt; $18 to help defray the cost of Studio rental and provided materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: &lt;/strong&gt;Any member of the NE ATC+ Meetup and up to two guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP: &lt;/strong&gt;These smaller sessions are often   full with a waiting list. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using   Meetup's RSVP function. Please RSVP for your guests as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP   accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;Your own art kit (scissors, glue sticks, ruler, pencil, pens and markers) will be good to have along. &lt;strong&gt;(Optional) &lt;/strong&gt;All materials will be provided for one or two journals, but please feel free to bring any papers you'd like to use and/or share. We'll have at least 2&amp;nbsp;guillotine paper cutters, but if you have this or some other type of paper trimmer please try to bring it &amp;mdash; we'll be cutting a lot of paper.&amp;nbsp;You can also bring along any particular image or artwork you'd like to use as a cover for your journal. But basic tools and supplies --   scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are also available for your use.   Even if you show up empty-handed, we can get you started on the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;In the unlikely event that we need to   cancel---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a   message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be   on the safe side, please check the Web site and your inbox before   departing for ArtStudio 36&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>emelengy</member_name><member_id>4250560</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pat</member_name><member_id>4858394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307304286000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306810852000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Found Papers (aka "Poor Man's") Journal"</name><id>20310331</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307206800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/20310331/</event_url></item>
