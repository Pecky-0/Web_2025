Just a reminder we are still looking for people to step up and help host upcoming meetups as Kelly and I have other commitments that me make it difficult to always be there in the coming months... February promises to be another great time. What better way to show our love for our beautiful pugs than Valentines? So everone bring say a box of 24 or so Valentines and we will have a fun little Puggy Valentine swap! As usual, we will have some scrumtious snacks and maybe a love potion punch for everyone to enjoy as well...DONT MISS THIS ONE FOLKS! I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome all the new members to our group. Everyone please keep in mind that the point of this meetup is to socialize our pugs, and sometimes this is a transition period...barking is part of dogs voicing their feelings....this is a play group, not church, so please be patient with newcomers....Thank you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another quick note: We have so much fun at these meetups, but all comes with a small price to us as organizers. We do ask that each family pay a small $5 fee at the door when you arrive to each meetup so please be sure to bring that with you as your "ticket" in. It costs us money each month to be a member of this website, we always provide sweets and drinks and prizes and decorations all cost money. Any leftover, are donated to Pug Rescue organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kelly and I truly enjoy being the Organizers of the Grafton pug Meetup. We hope that we have met each of you individually, and if we have not, please come up and introduce yourself at the next one. We are constantly trying to come up with new treats for our precious pugs, and ideas to keep it informative and interesting. We welcome all suggestions. It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun. We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and play in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. Note: &lt;strong&gt;this is a PUG Meetup&lt;/strong&gt;...as not all breeds play well together. There are other small breed Meetups, but this is for PUGS ONLY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)********* (this has not been strictly enforced at the Meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will ask for a $5 fee per family for each Meetup&lt;/strong&gt; to cover Meetup costs and any leftover money will be donated to the Curly Tail Pug Rescue as well as other animal related charity that we all agree on as a group. These donations go toward paying the monthly dues, snacks and to keep this website going so we can all see when the next Meetup is taking place. We will also do special events from time to time to keep it fun and interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
