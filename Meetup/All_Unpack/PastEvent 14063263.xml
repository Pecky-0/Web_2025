This has been on the Organizer's Team Menu for the past couple of summers and it came in 2nd in the Warm Weather Restaurant Poll that members recently voted in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Fishbones offers the Boston areas finest dining. We specialize in Seafood, Steaks, Pasta, Desserts and much, much more. You will be dazzled by our fine food and desserts, as well as the most comfortable and exciting atmosphere offered in Marina Bay. If you are looking for a place for a nice night out with your loved one or just looking for a place for a meal with some friends...Captain Fishbones is the place!  Entrees range from $10-$30, depending on Market Price.  Salads and Appetizers range from $5-$17.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Note about Seating:  While the restaurant cannot guarantee us outdoor seating, they will do their best to accommodate us.  We have reserved the window table overlooking the patio and water that has a sliding door so we will be as close to outside as possible if we can't actually sit outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday Lunch @ Marina Bay&lt;br /&gt;Captain Fishbones&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, July 18th @ 1:00pm&lt;br /&gt;333 Victory Road&lt;br /&gt;Marina Bay&lt;br /&gt;North Quincy, MA 02171&lt;br /&gt;www.captainfishbones.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Location: &lt;i&gt;Outside the front door on the boardwalk.  We will then go in together as a Group.&lt;/i&gt; Otherwise, inside the Lobby.  If you arrive after we are seated the reservation is under &amp;quot;Angela.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer(s): Angela &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: Min of 5 people 48 hours in advance.  Max of 12 people.  *Maximum changed to 8 people at 6pm on Sat 7/17 per the RSVP Deadline.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: 1 per Member&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fees: Current Annual Members &amp;amp; 1 Guest - FREE, Group Members - $2, Guests - $2, Mid-Year Annual Membership is $10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: 6pm on Saturday, July 17th.  Any changes made after this time may not be seen by an Event Organizer and will be considered a No-Show per our guidelines on the About Us page.  Please Note: The restaurant has requested we call in our final RSVP on Saturday. (A quick note about the RSVP Deadline, you can only RSVP up until 10am the day of the event.  After that time you will not be able to RSVP.  While the Group's RSVP Deadline is Saturday evening, this will allow anyone to join us Sunday morning if a spot opens up if someone is unable to make it between Saturday's deadline and Sunday's cutoff.  This is a feature we rarely use.  In fact, we don't intend to use it more than once or twice a year but there may be a special event where it is necessary to use it in the future so we are 'testing the waters' with it for this event so you are aware of it.  Basically, you can't RSVP on the site after 10am on Sunday.  Our No-Show policy remains the same; any changes from Yes to No after the deadline and/or anyone who is a Yes at the deadline who does not attend is considered a No-Show.  Our updated RSVP policy still allows for one excused No-Show per 12 month period from the previous excused N/S.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cash Only Policy: Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over three years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Event takes place rain or shine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are a little tricky for your organizer so I suggest you use mapquest or go to the website for directions.  I am doing my best with directions below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview: At Marina Bay on the boardwalk nearest the giant parking lot near the 'commercial' side of the marina.  The former WaterWorks which is now the Ocean Club is off this parking lot.  When you drive down the main road in Marina Bay you'll come to the row of businesses on the boardwalk and can go left or right.  Take a left and the restaurant is located on the very end immediately off the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take Quincy Shore Drive north bound, you will follow it the entire way until you get to the intersection with Dunkin Donuts.  Take a right at this light and Marina Bay is less than 1/4 mile on the left.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet outside the Front Door on the Boardwalk.
