&lt;p&gt;December 21, 2012: The End of the World As We Know It? &lt;br /&gt;

 December 21, 2012 marks the end of the current cycle of time according to the Maya calendar. But does that mean the Maya predicted the end of the world on that date? Will time stop, the Earth stop rotating on its axis, the sun become a supernova, and will our entire solar system get sucked into a giant black hole at the center of our galaxy? Should we all be exchanging Christmas gifts early in December 2012, because none of us are going to make it to the 25th of that month? Inquiring minds want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Our very popular Connecticut State University archaeology professor, Dr. Ken Feder, will attempt to ease your concerns about 2012 because he knows the Maya didn’t predict anything particularly momentous on that date. Then again, maybe he’s part of a government cover-up to prevent widespread panic before it’s lights out for good!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Kaplan Hall Room 101</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349834897000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1349289477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dr. Kenneth Feder - "December 2012; The End of the World (As We Know It)?")</name><id>85335942</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349823600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/85335942/</event_url></item>
