And as a response to my intense desire to have a cooldown after our hard work bushwhacking around Kettletown, I thought the beach might be a nice place to have our next romp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325210#map" target="_blank"&gt;Hammonassett State Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hammonassett State Park has the longest shoreline beach in Connecticut and attracts over 1 million visitors each season.  And in addition to the beach are hiking and biking trails, and of course, geocaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/gmnearest.aspx?lat=41.253667&amp;amp;lon=-72.549933" target="_blank"&gt;Geocaches at Hammonassett State Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you new to the sport, geocaching is one of the best ways that I have found to find new and exciting places to visit, especially when you are unfamiliar with a place. Below is a link to some of the commonly asked questions about what geocaching is and how the sport works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/faq/" target="_blank"&gt;Geocaching FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the files section you will find a map of the park.  We will meet at the parking area at the far FAR end of the park near the point marked &amp;quot;Meigs Point Nature Center.&amp;quot;  (On the map it's the parking area in the bottom right corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to do a couple of geocaches, possibly have lunch at the fabulous Lenny and Joe's just up Route 1 (where there is also a micro-cache that I have yet to find) and then  spend some time relaxing on the beach.  So, bring your hiking boots, an appetite and your swimming suit for a relaxing Sunday.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>28</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186787151000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183954383000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Geocaching Hike and Beach Romp to Hammonassett SP</name><id>5994439</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186322400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/5994439/</event_url></item>
