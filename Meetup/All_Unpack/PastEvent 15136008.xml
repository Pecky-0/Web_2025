We will be having a bonfire party at my house.  Please bring items that you would like to cook on the fire to share (a potluck)--hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any musical instruments that they would like to play please bring them, I will bring my guitar.  We will be joined by other meetup groups.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be outside but have access to the bathroom in the house.  We have a large picnic table there but please bring your chairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Party starts at 6 pm. If anyone wants to learn how to build a bonfire I will be there at 5 pm, so if you want to give me a hand I would appreciate it.  Please do not bring any wood to burn--I have plenty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a chair, please bring that.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a potluck event so please bring something to cook over the fire or that you've made.  Please no potato chips or twinkies, just real food. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check this web site for rescheduling in case of bad weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My house is actually on &amp;quot;30 Long Pond Road&amp;quot; which is right next to 12 Hampshire Ave.  My road is brand new so it might not appear on someone's GPS or mapquest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for the tiki torches at the begining of the driveway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289237952000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>36</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287327570000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bonfire / Potluck cookout</name><id>15136008</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1289080800000</time><rsvp_limit>55</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15136008/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/1/global_5473521.jpeg</photo_url></item>
