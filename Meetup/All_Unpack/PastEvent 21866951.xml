WHITES/NH - "1 day Pemi Loop Hike" on July 2nd (Sat) by staying at
the campsite on 7/1(Fri) &amp;amp; 7/2(Sat) before/after hike. This
hiking event will be completed on 7/3(Sun) morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;Before you sign up, please read the
  entire event description carefully.&amp;nbsp; When/what time you sign
  up on this event really does 
  &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; matter
  because you'll be staying on the Waiting List anyway for a
  while.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;As this hiking event is strenuous
  and challenging, we (event organizers) are going to screen if
  hikers on the waiting list have enough hiking experience to join
  us and complete 32miles 1 day hike with us.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;After you read and understand what
  is required completely, please sign up. Then, you'll be asked
  several questions.&amp;nbsp; If we don't see your answers for them,
  you won't have a chance to join our hike at all.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Hiking Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemi Loop is approximately 32 miles foot trail which covers 8
4000 footers at Pemigewasset Wilderness in NH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start from Lincoln Woods Trail from Lincoln Woods Visitor
Center Parking lot.&amp;nbsp; Our hike goes clockwise with the
following mountains in this order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mt Flume (4328 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Mt Liberty (4459 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*. Little Haystack Mtn (4780 ft, but, it's not counted as 48 4K
footers by AMC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Mt. Lincoln (5089 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Mt Lafayette (5260 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Mt Garfield (4500 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. South Twin Mtn (4902 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Mt Bond (4698 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Bondcliff (4265 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;Book Time is 21 Hours 49 mins but
  we'd like to complete under book time.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 more 4K peaks nearby which are Galehead Mtn (4024
ft) &amp;amp; West Bond (4540 ft) but each of them require additional 1
miles RT hike to reach its summit.&amp;nbsp; So there is NO plan to go
there on this event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Requirement to join this hiking event:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We expect hikers who join us can keep up with 
&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2mph hiking pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in overall.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If
our average pace is 2pmh, we can complete this challenging long
distance hike by 16 hours. (Beat Book Time about 5+hours)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Since we're planning to start hiking VERY EARLY MORNING (like
5AM) on 7/2(Sat), this event requires hikers to stay campsite on
7/1 Friday night. Once we read your answers against to our
questions, we'll contact you through email individually.&amp;nbsp;
We'll explain the cost of campsite. Once you send us check, we'll
move you to "On Going" list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked one tent site where 4 adults can stay at
maximum.&amp;nbsp; We can try to book one more tent site depending on
the number of hikers.&amp;nbsp; Larger a hiking group gets, slower
hiking pace will be, in general.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, we prefer to hike
with a small group which is up to 6-8 people at most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't provide tent etc.&amp;nbsp; So you're expected to have your
own tent, camping gear, and foods etc. to cook and eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. We may want to car spot at certain location(s) of trailhead
just in case when we have to give up our hike in the middle due to
some reasons. (ex. Garfield Trail TH, Gale River Tr TH and/or North
Twin Tr TH etc.) So we get together on 7/1(Fri) evening at the
campsite and we car spot on Friday night before we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. 32miles hike per a day is very long hike.&amp;nbsp; So we'll be
back to the same campsite on Sat night to stay one more
night.&amp;nbsp; On Sunday morning, after we eat breakfast, we pick up
our cars in car spot location(s).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Then, this event will
be completed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So you'll need to have time available
from Friday evening&amp;nbsp; to Sunday morning to join this
event.&amp;nbsp; No exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. You're expected to hike as a group.&amp;nbsp; If you're faster
than anybody else, you'll need to slow down or wait for us
frequently in every single trail junction at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. This is weather dependent hike since we don't want to hike
32miles during miserable weather. We may cancel this event due to
bad weather forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. We, event organizers, will not be able to access internet for
2 weeks between 6/13-25.&amp;nbsp; We're probably able to access
internet and contact you after 6/26.&amp;nbsp; So please be
patient....&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to drop me an
email.&lt;/p&gt;
