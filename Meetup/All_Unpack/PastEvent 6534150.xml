The book for November will be &amp;quot;Love In The Time of Cholera&amp;quot; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The author is a world famous Latin American writer who has won the Nobel Prize in literature.  He is a pioneer of the style of fiction called &amp;quot;Magical Realism&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get into the spirit of the book we will hold our meetup at On The Border Mexican Grill in West Springfield.  It is extremely important to RSVP accurately so I can make the reservation.  You can view the menu and pricing on the restaurant's website &lt;a href="http://www.ontheborder.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.ontheborder.com&lt;/a&gt;.   When you get into the restaurant just tell them you're there for the book club.  Please try and be at least 10 minutes early.  I hope to see you all for good food and a great discussion at our next meetup.  Remember friends and family are always welcome.  They do not have to register on meetup.com, you can just add them as your guests so we have an accurate count.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melissa</member_name><member_id>3059165</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194564774000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192153027000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November Book Discussion</name><id>6534150</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194391800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/6534150/</event_url></item>
