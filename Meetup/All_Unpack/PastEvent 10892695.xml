We will be continuing our Magic 2010 Draft League, we will have open table for DCI sanctioned gaming as well as prizes and surprises!  In addition this is also the launch party for the new Planechase set!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multiplayer Mayhem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Planechase plane cards introduce a groundbreaking new way to experience planeswalking. Through this innovative new kind of card, two or more players can battle each other across a variety of diverse worlds, each with its own unique effect on the game. These thrilling new conditions add a whole new layer of chaos, meaning the only thing you can count on is unpredictability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be four Planechase Game Packs released on September 4th, 2009: Elemental Thunder, Metallic Dreams, Strike Force, and Zombie Empire.  Each game pack will contain 10 all-new plane cards, a ready-to-play 60-card deck, a six-sided planar die and a Planechase strategy insert with multiplayer rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the 60-card decks will include 8 rares, and will be composed of cards from throughout Magic's history - including a preview card from Zendikar. The 10 oversized plane cards comprise a planar deck. They feature all-new artwork depicting some of the more exotic realms of the Magic multiverse.  Each of the cards in the 60-card decks will be black-bordered and tournament legal. This means that these cards are legal for use in any tournaments where the original printings are still legal.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Szewczyk</member_name><member_id>4695834</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252451466000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247781242000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Magic - Planechase Release &amp; Magic the Gathering 2010 League</name><id>10892695</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252101600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/10892695/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/9/global_9572569.jpeg</photo_url></item>
