Everything from loose leash walking to trick training will be done during our walk plus question and answer through the scenic trail. Help improve the image by giving people something great to look at! Impressions stick with people, so come join us, work on your handling skills and help improve both your dogs&amp;rsquo; behavior and our bully breed image! :) Casual outing here... Leashed walk down the newly-extended Milford Rail Trail with the dogs. Bring the treats for sporadic training from moving attention to loose-leash walking. The NEBBC folks are always up for an impromptu trick session! (We seem to incorporate it into everything! :) ~~~~ As the costs of the group have gone up, we are asking for a $5 donation from participants... Donate to the "Donation Dog" in the vest :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334431479000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333273199000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Walk 'n Train!</name><id>qbdhscyqgbrb</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334329200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/58741282/</event_url></item>
