This is a joint event with the RiversEdge Photographic Society(&lt;a href="http://www.repsc.com/)" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.repsc.com/...&lt;/a&gt;, with Bert Halstead serving as the creative director.  We will have several sets with lights and various backgrounds for the shoot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost will be $20 per photographer to cover studio expenses; there &lt;br /&gt;may be a small additional cost to be shared by everybody if there are additional expenses.  Models will sign a release and photographers will provide everyone who participates with &lt;br /&gt;low-resolution digital copies of their images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All participants must arrive by 12 noon -- models and makeup artists so they can start getting prepared to shoot, and photographers and designers so we can have a meeting about the goals for the shoot and the procedures that we'll follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The studio has many sets and we would like to have as many of them active as possible to maximize the value that everybody gets out of the shoot.  Photographers, if you have studio lighting equipment, please &lt;br /&gt;bring it so we can supplement CoverShot's own lighting equipment and get even more sets into operation.  Also bring your speedlight-type flash units so you'll be equipped to shoot on unlit sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Image makers is coming together nicely as asubgroup of the Boston Fashion Industry Meetup. We currently have 38 members consisting of models, makeup artist, photographers, stylist and designers.&lt;br /&gt;Our first meeting and shoot was on January 24th at Positive Image studio.  Since it was the first meeting we spent about 2 hours  talking and defining our mission then we had a shoot with models Hui and Jo-Jo.  The models wore their own clothes and did their own makeup.  During the first meeting we decided that the format for this group would be a photo shoot about every month with one person volunteering as the creative director for the shoot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second meeting/shoot was Feb 28th on location at a contemporary house.  We spent a short amount of time talking and several hours shooting.  This was a very well organized fashion shoot with excellent team effort.  Clothes were provided by Designers: Olivia Chow, Elena Gorczyca and the Suneri Boutique.  Models were Beata,  Hui, and Lidia.  Styling was by Olivia Chow and Olivia Kostigen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can view images from the Jan and Feb shoots at &lt;a href="http://fashion.meetup.com/1/photos/"&gt;http://fashion.meetup...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info will be posted as the shoot concept and casting develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email me ron@positiveimage-boston.com or Bert Halstead bert@berthalstead.com if you want to participate in this shoot  and donâ€™t forget to rsvp here.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>go to the 3rd floor from the side entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Ranere</member_name><member_id>975035</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240477806000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Fashion Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFashion</urlname><id>59186</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Fashion Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236843018000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Image Makers April Shoot</name><id>9937996</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238947200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFashion/events/9937996/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/b/global_7642395.jpeg</photo_url></item>
