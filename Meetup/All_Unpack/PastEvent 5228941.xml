I just got back from a week long retreat in beautiful Colorado. I am eager to meet up with you all again and the new people who just joined. We will meet Thursday evening Nov 2 at 7pm at The Center of Light located at 97 Perkins St. in Jamaica Plain, MA. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had some good turn outs in the past and I am looking forward to our group growing, please try and come on time so we can introduce ourselves to each other, have some tea and then go inside for some peaceful meditation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a quote for you... &lt;br /&gt;There is a place where words are born of silence, A place where the whispers of the heart arise. RUMI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In light, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1162684951000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1162056776000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meditation and Mystical tea</name><id>5228941</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1162512000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/5228941/</event_url></item>
