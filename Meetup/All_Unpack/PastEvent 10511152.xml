<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm hosting another game day this coming Sunday, May 31, starting at 1 pm and running until 7 pm or so. My gaming brother will be in town fom the UK, and I'd like as many people to beat him as possible, so I hope you'll swing by and help make this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP with an arrival time if you're in, and feel free to suggest games if there's something specific you want to play. Otherwise I'm likely to bring out games from my review stack, and those tend to be hit-or-miss since they're untested. In any case, hope to see you here!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the host of the house</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246120841000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243482934000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>10511152</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243789200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/10511152/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
