Clemma, the family's housekeeper (and the story's narrator), dreads a visit from the husband who deserted her years before. Burt Hines, a recovering workaholic convalescing from a second heart attack, looks forward to the arrival of the ex-wife he still loves. Burt's daughter Josie has just broken her  &lt;br /&gt;engagement to an intense Harvard law student, and she pines for his buddy Ray, an aspiring writer with whom she once had a brief fling. Ray shows up with a strikingly dim-witted model on his arm, and a young Miami gangster with a gift for malapropisms brings comic hilarity to the gathering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday May 21, 2008 &lt;br /&gt;At the Park Road Playhouse &lt;br /&gt;244 Park Road &lt;br /&gt;West Hartford, CT 06119 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:15?7:15 pm Light Dinner, Beer and Wine &lt;br /&gt;Play begins at 7:30 pm &lt;br /&gt;Dessert and Coffee at Intermission &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $35.00 per person and include all refreshments &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceeds benefit the YMCA Strong Kids Campaign&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will find out if you need to purchase tickets ahead of time.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy AKA Jeanine</member_name><member_id>5547282</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211580606000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Because you will be helping Children</why><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205289976000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Proposal By Neil Simon and Light Dinner to benefit the YMCA Strong Kids Campaign</name><id>7515312</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211407200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/7515312/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/e/global_2869038.jpeg</photo_url></item>
