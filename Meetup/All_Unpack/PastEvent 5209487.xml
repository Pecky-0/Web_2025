<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 5 mile hike of generally moderate effort which includes a fair amount of cliff-top hiking. This hike is a thru-hike and not a loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike is on part of the extensive Mattabesett Tail system that makes an arc below Middletown, CT. We'll meet-up on Route 66 at Guida's Restaurant, in the general area where we've done the trail to Higby Mountain, way in the back of the parking lot, near the cell tower. Most vehicles will be left at the meet-up location. The hike will end back at the restaurant. We'll transport people to the starting point for the trail, roughly 5 miles to the south. We'll hike northbound and have a number of cliff-top experiences along the way to the end of the hike. There will also be periods of forested hiking as well as passing through the summit of the Power Ridge Ski Resort. Near the end of the hike will be the most dramatic views from the cliffs overlooking the Black Pond with Higby Mountain and Chauncey Peak in the distance. It will be a little steep in places as we descend from this point. There will be some areas of the hike where there will be some fairly steep uphill hiking for short distances. Most of the hike is moderately rolling along the cliff top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are hungry, we can eat at Guida's Restaurant after the hike as we head to the vehicles. The hike leader will need someone to run him/her and any other drivers back to the hike starting location to pick up vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is anticipated to take about 3 hours and be over by about 3:30 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this hike is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;) so please direct questions on the hike to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from the Hartford area:&lt;br /&gt;* Take I-91 South &lt;br /&gt;* Take the MIDDLE ST./COUNTRY CLUB RD. exit- EXIT 20 &lt;br /&gt;* At the stop sign turn LEFT onto MIDDLE ST and go only a hundred yards or so to another stop sign at COUNTRY CLUB RD. &lt;br /&gt;* Turn LEFT (East) onto COUNTRY CLUB RD. crossing I-91.
