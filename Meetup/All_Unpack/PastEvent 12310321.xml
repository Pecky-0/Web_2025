Please try to come at or Before 5:00PM by almost 5:15PM the place is full and I doubt we can get or hold any tables if people come too late.&lt;br /&gt;If you come after 5:15 PM I cannot be sure you all will be sitting together at one table with our group, I just wanted to warn people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grendels Den has been serving casual gourmet dishes and international specialties in the same location for over 35 years. They have a full bar and an beer selection reknown for its high quality selection of imports, microbrews and hot cider with rum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is an easy T accessible event as well. I hope many of you will be available to join us! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267567550000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263411378000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>GRENDEL'S DEN</name><id>12310321</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267394400000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/12310321/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/2/global_13218210.jpeg</photo_url></item>
