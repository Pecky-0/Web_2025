NH DOT will provide the bags, signs and pretty orange vests (sorry we must return them when we are done!) for the cleanup.  From past events, when we had roughly 10 people show up the clean-up only took about 2 hours (so I'm told).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this activity will be occurring on a major road, this is not a kid friendly event (and I'm sure it's against the law any way).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we will have a lunch at my house for those that helped with the clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am recommending that we meet at my house and then drive/carpool to the location of the pickup.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214831154000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211462449000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHLA Roadside Pick-Up</name><id>7990863</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214658000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/7990863/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/f/a/global_3188554.jpeg</photo_url></item>
