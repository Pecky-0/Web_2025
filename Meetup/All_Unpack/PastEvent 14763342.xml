The Banks of The River Charles is a perfect locating when the weather is nice. It sounds a bit like drums sound in Guinea! - If you've never joined us for one of these outdoor DrumCircles, this is your chance to experience something magical! Playing along the river, having dancers, BBQ's - its a party in the making! And we move to &lt;b&gt;Sat. Afternoons&lt;/b&gt; to make the party last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our next DrumCircle Meetup is Sat. Sept. 25th from 2-4ish at the Charles River&lt;/b&gt; (Parking lot #4  near the Public Theatre - depending on parking availability)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there! Please bring a chair, water and your drum. Email me with any questions you may have. alan@drumconnection.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours in Drumming Spirit,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan, Fanta, and Stu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drumconnection.com"&gt;DrumConnection Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We start setting up about 30 minutes before the circle.
