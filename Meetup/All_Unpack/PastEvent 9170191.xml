If you don't have dinner plans please email me directly if you would like to join us for Thanksgiving dinner at at my mother's (limited to 3 people) in Worcester.  We'll meet at the Visitor Center at 11:00 and start hiking by 11:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wachusett Mountain is about an hour's drive from Boston. Please note the walk to the top is not especially difficult but could be more challenging than other walks.  My plan is too walk/hike for about 2.0 hours so please bring some snacks and plenty of water.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUNCH: My mom is cooking Thanksgiving Dinner so please bring something to share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3,000-acre Wachusett Mountain State Reservation surrounds the summit and offers a wealth of natural and recreational resources. The Reservation's natural resources include forests, alpine meadows, ponds, streams, fields, and even a perched bog. Recreational opportunities abound at the reservation including hiking, nature study, hawk watching, picnicking, and skiing. The Reservation offers 17 miles of hiking and walking trails, including 3.9 miles of the Midstate Trail, which runs from Ashburnham to the Rhode Island border. Mountain Road stretches to the John Hitchcock Visitor's Center at the summit, a short distance from the Wachusett Mountain Ski Area, which is the largest in eastern Massachusetts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/wach.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in front of the visitor center.
