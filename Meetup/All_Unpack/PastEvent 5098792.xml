<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&amp;quot;Lunacy&amp;quot; is the lastest feature from the acclaimed  surrealist Czech animator and director Jan Svankmajer. His previous film, &amp;quot;Little Otik&amp;quot; was a disturbing fable of a desperate childless couple who tend to a log (no typo) which has an infant's features which not only becomes alive but turns into quite a gluttonous little monster. It was brilliant and I've been waiting 3 years for his next feature to play in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adapting the writings of Poe and  De Sade , a young man is befriended by a crazed Marquis who initiates him in some of his rituals and and who eventually is taken to an insane asylum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should let you know that Svankmajer's imagery  at times is grotesque and shocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a link to a review during its recent run in NYC:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be holding a Meet-Up sign near the front row after the movie and there is a good little Mid-Eastern cafe that we can walk to afterwards, although drinks might be in order after this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is $9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.cinematical.com/2006/04/27/tribeca-review-lunacy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cinematical.com/2006/04/27/tribeca-review-lunacy" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cinematica...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156629503000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lunacy at the MFA</name><id>5098792</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1157831100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5098792/</event_url></item>
