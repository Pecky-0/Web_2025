There's more than I could ever use on my own! Here are the berries currently lurking throughout my backyard and along my hidden path:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;1. BLACKBERRIES!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;2. RASPBERRIES!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;3. BLUEBERRIES!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's coming towards the end of the raspberries and the start of the blackberries, so it should be a good weekend to pick. Also, I've found some random blueberries, but they take a little bit more work to find! They aren't all ready yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope too see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please bring:&lt;br /&gt;1. Your own bowls to pick berries in!&lt;br /&gt;2. Something to carry your berries home in (bowl, plastic container, etc!)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>8243578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281136924000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Out &amp; Abouters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Out-and-About-Group</urlname><id>1365436</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Out and About Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280416938000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last Minute Meetup!
