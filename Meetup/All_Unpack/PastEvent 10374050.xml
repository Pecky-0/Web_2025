Purgatory Chasm that it!!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for a fun day of climbing over boulders or as I like to say &amp;quot;Rock climbing the easy way!!&amp;quot;.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your not in the mood to climb, there are also plenty of hiking trails to do instead.  You may just want to stay in the area and enjoy the great outdoors.  The possibilities are endless.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your picnic lunch and we can relax and get to know each other better before we head into the Chasm or we can do the Chasm first and really work up an appetite.  Just remember to bring plenty of water and a hat, it can get very hot in the Chasm.  Good walking or hiking shoes are also a must.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see  you all there!!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/purg.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be near the entrance to the chasm w/ a TFS sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281130664000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241883706000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's go to Purgatory</name><id>10374050</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243272600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/10374050/</event_url></item>
