I've joined them the last couple times and they are a good group of guys (and welcoming to women as Debby and Darlys attended and Darlys creamed us at Power Grid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play the Euro's but they are evenly split between those playing Euro's, Train games (18XX, etc) and War games (you know the ones with 30 page rule books). Some of these guys will play from 6pm until 3am or later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, no children.  I'll send the exact address to those that RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff M</member_name><member_id>4602649</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242687181000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Gamers</urlname><id>393834</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Greater Nashua Gamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241279770000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night in Salem NH (Euro's, Train and War Games)</name><id>10319279</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242511200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Gamers/events/10319279/</event_url></item>
