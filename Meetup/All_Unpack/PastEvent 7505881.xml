I've reserved a table for 16 (4 four tops but together) each table will represent a team; top three winning teams win prizes.  Basically we are dining beginning at 6PM and while we play trivia starting at 6:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The venue is a bit hard to find with no sign but they are downstairs on the corner of Congress and Ave A.  It's an easy walk from South Station and parking is decent for street, a lot on the next block charges $10. I recommend doing the T due to potential traffic and hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: the display pic shows the Trivia starting at 8-they have changed trivia to 6:30 for the Financial District Happy Hour folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring cash for dinner and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it out; &lt;a href="http://luckyslounge.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://luckyslounge.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential for others to join at the bar but I'm told they are strict about the Trivia team policy (?) and sitting together. Don't hesitate to come by if you can't make dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the meeting is full please hit no and ask to be wait listed.  &amp;quot;Maybes&amp;quot; must confirm &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; 1 week prior to the event.  I'll send out a reminder!  Thanks for understanding!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Glow stick bracelet or ask for "Terri Meetup" reservation.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207174315000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><why>If you like to have fun after work with good people... look no further!</why><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205188426000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lucky's Trivia Night...Dinner AND Trivia</name><id>7505881</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207000800000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/7505881/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/8/global_3451048.jpeg</photo_url></item>
