&lt;p&gt;Jacob Wirth is the ideal venue for us to welcome the change of season and celebrate Oktoberfest locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its name Okoberfest is traditionally celebrated during the last two weeks in September but it seems the dates were lost in translation here in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and enjoy some hearty German fare and especially beer for our closest approximation of this Bavarian feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href="http://jacobwirth.com/pages/menu_dinner.html"&gt;Jacob Wirth dinner menu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://jacobwirth.com/pdfs/j_wirth_tasting_menu_sept08.pdf"&gt;Jacob Wirth German Tasting Menu&lt;/a&gt; so you're prepared to place your order and we are able to enjoy our meal soon after we're seated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone daring enough to dine in a dirndl or lederhosen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARKING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have parking luck I advise you check out &lt;a href="http://boston.bestparking.com/#1"&gt;Best Parking&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://parkingcarma.com/ParkingSearchResults.aspx?Address=545%20boylston%20street%2002116"&gt;Parking Carma&lt;/a&gt; for nearby parking garages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before I list the Reservation Rules, please understand the NO-SHOW policy was established to ensure everyone who wants to join can and it will be fairly and strictly enforced. I want to assure you I do understand if you've RSVPd YES and on the day of our meal you have a sudden change of plans because you're lost, you don't feel well or you have transportation issues. My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Rules for Events with Reservations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is less than an hour from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(617) 445-7549&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax. This will help us to settle the bill quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All RSVPs are on a first reply, first seated basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO. Maybe isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the meal is full and you wish to attend, please select WAIT LIST RSVP. When a spot opens, your RSVP will be changed to YES based on the time of your WAIT LIST RSVP and if you answered the RSVP question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the meal and you have not attended nor contacted me, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I change your RSVP to NO because you haven't replied to final update meal confirmation email deadline, it is counted as a NO-SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW each will count as if you've NO-SHOWED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO within an hour of the reservation, it is counted as a NO-SHOW if you do not contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events with reservations you are removed from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email from you explaining your absence is an expected courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are removed and there were extenuating circumstances, please email Tonya about rejoining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is appreciated so please, rate the event and venue by completing surveys afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be arrive at 7:15 PM to welcome you from Jacob Wirth's bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Tonya/Meetup reservation or call/text (617) 445-7549 for help finding us.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349978702000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348417931000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oktoberfest Dinner</name><id>83706612</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1349910900000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/83706612/</event_url></item>
