I'll be posting to the mailing list looking for other places/times the New England Metaphysical Club can meet... so please share your ideas on when/where you'd like other meetings to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topic of this next meeting is still to be decided - if you can attend, please let us know what topic you're interested in. The general topic of &amp;quot;herbs&amp;quot; went very well and it seems like a group with a lot of fascinating interests! I'm sure we'll be able cover almost any topic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The shop is only open for the New England Metaphysical Club at that hour. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>William </member_name><member_id>4792394</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>dawn </member_name><member_id>8580472</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266880399000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Metaphysics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>metaphysics-387</urlname><id>682186</id><group_lat>43.4399986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7600021362</group_lon><name>The New England Metaphysical Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264303597000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February "Monthly Meeting In NH" </name><id>12404891</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266706800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/metaphysics-387/events/12404891/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/1/3/global_12047907.jpeg</photo_url></item>
