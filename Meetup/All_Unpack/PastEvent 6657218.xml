So this is a VERY special SUPER advanced screening. It has only been shown @film festival circuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Remember this is screening only. We won't be having a discussion afterwards. The film will be downstairs in auditorium #1. That means there'll be a LOOOONG line. I'll try to be there around 6PM. I'll be wearing my green hat w/meetup logo+my screename JediFonger. If you want to sit together, look for me.&lt;br /&gt;-JediFonger&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194480573000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193943691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Advanced Screening: The Orphanage</name><id>6657218</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194307200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/6657218/</event_url></item>
