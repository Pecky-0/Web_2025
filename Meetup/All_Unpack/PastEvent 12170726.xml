Have a &amp;quot;Courrier and Ives&amp;quot; experience as you bundle up in your lap robes and hand muffs, and let the sleigh take you from this bustling century to a more tranquil time. Bring your own refreshments to warm your body and spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're riding &amp;quot;over the river and through the woods&amp;quot; on a good old fashion sleigh ride. I have booked 2 sleighs to hold a total of 10 people for a 45 minute ride. Then another 10 can ride for 45 minutes...so a total of 20 people in 2 sleighs for 45 minutes per ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have a campfire ...bring your hot chocolate or mulled cider...and any other snacks that you may want. We have been invited to stay at the campfire for as long as we wish! Thanks, John!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for the ride and campfire is $22.00 per person. A great bargain for a fun afternoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, assuming that there are those who wish to continue the fun...we can all go for pizza at a local pizzeria afterward. Sound like fun? Then go ahead and sign up!!! Let's make the most of the winter!   &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Terri Bruno and the meetup tags... </how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263240588000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262122500000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Over The River and Through The Woods...A Sleigh Ride!</name><id>12170726</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263067200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/12170726/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/f/d/global_12419629.jpeg</photo_url></item>
