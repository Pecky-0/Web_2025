The Apple Hill  hike is about 1 1/2 hours It's a  good hike for beginers, lots of up hill, but not hard. You hike  from the bottom trail head up to the top and back down to your  car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn't much parking at the trail head so we should carpool as much as possible. There's no parking lot there so it's all on the side of the street. Meet at the Conservation Center on Rt. 202.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80 Whitehall Road&lt;br /&gt;Litchfield, Connecticut 06759&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For after the hike there's a Mexican place, Chinese, pizza, and surely more we could go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrive at Concervation Center at 10:30 AM. Transfer to trailhead carpool and leave at about 10:45 AM. Arrive at Trailhead at 11 AM. Hike for 1.5 hours and done at 12:30 PM. Carpool back to other vehicles by 12:45 PM. Arrive at place to eat by about 1 PM. Eat for about 45 min. so done at 1:45 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can all work to arrange a carpool from the Hartford area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this one is Heather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trail map can be found at (poor quality image):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whitememorialcc.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.whitememor...&lt;/a&gt; /map1_med.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.whitememorialcc.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whitememorialcc.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.whitememor...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1142573724000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at White Memorial Conservation Center in Litchfield</name><id>4878416</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1143905400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4878416/</event_url></item>
