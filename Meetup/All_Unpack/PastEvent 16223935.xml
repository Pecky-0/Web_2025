We could paddle out to the Logan runway in this sheltered harbor area, and along the shoreline (for kayakers of only modest experience such as myself :-) over mussel shoals in relatively protected waters, up to (and into, if we go at the high tide) and into the lovely Belle Isle saltmarsh/reservation. Maybe pull up for a picnic in the reservation, or go to one of the little restaurants around the reservation, then paddle back to winthrop. Parking is available at the launch point for a small fee, and there is some onstreet parking available in the immediate area as well...&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309022236000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-38</urlname><id>582176</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270660716000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crystal Cove to Belle Isle Marsh/Reservation and back...</name><id>16223935</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309017600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-38/events/16223935/</event_url></item>
