Eugenia Skeeter Phelan is just home from college in 1962, and, anxious to become a writer, is advised to hone her chops by writing about what disturbs you. The budding social activist begins to collect the stories of the black women on whom the country club sets relies and mistrusts enlisting the help of Aibileen, a maid who's raised 17 children, and Aibileen's best friend Minny, who's found herself unemployed more than a few times after mouthing off to her white employers. The book Skeeter puts together based on their stories is scathing and shocking, bringing pride and hope to the black community, while giving Skeeter the courage to break down her personal boundaries and pursue her dreams. Assured and layered, full of heart and history, this one has bestseller written all over it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Help-Kathryn-Stockett/dp/0399155341/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1276194359&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280966115000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276194416000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Readers:  The Help, by Kathryn Stockett</name><id>13761874</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279751400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/13761874/</event_url></item>
