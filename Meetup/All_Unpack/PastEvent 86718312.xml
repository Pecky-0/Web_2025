The South Shore Natural Science Center is located on 30 acres surrounded by 200 acres of town conservation/recreation land consisting of meadows, woodland, and a pond. We welcome visitors year round.  Please no smoking or pets on the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently checked it out &amp;amp; decided it was worth scheduling as a meetup for another visit.  This meetup is also posted with the Boston/Providence Single Parents Meetup group. If you mention "Meetup" you'll get $1 off each admission (thanks Roger). Also, your local library may have a pass for free admission. I have reserved my library pass &amp;amp; have room for 2 more people on my pass, if you mention it in your RSVP.  Regular admission is $7 for adults and $3 for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is geared to kids around age 10 and under.  They have an iguana named Spike, turtles, a snake, chickens, owls and a huge bear (don't worry, he's stuffed).  At 2:00 p.m. they have an event called Meet an Animal. On our visit, they took out the owl for closer viewing &amp;amp; questions.  They have numerous easy walking trails through the woods around the property that are great for kids&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Outside the front entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cindy W</member_name><member_id>5146051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351973460000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350070033000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Natural Science Center (Families)</name><id>86718312</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351962000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/86718312/</event_url></item>
