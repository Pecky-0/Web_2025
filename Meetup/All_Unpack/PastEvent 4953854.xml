I propose that we each begin work on real-world projects to advance the application of alternative energy technologies.  (I recommend you take a look at my message board post entitled Small Renewables Initiative Program for a little guidance.)  Pick anything - Solar water heating for your house, a conversion of your car to run on waste vegi oil, a campaign to get a local business to install solar power or to buy Renewable Energy Credits - anything you can advance on (not necessarily finish) in a month.  Even if your project turns out to be a dead end for whatever reason, you'll surely have learned something along the way.  We can dedicate our next face-to-face meeting to present our projects, in whatever state they're in, and get ideas from each other.  For my project, I have my sights on getting the local swim club to install solar water heating on their huge south-facing roof.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.  - Josh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://masstech.org/Grants_and_Awards/GBP/small_renewables_3_03.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://masstech.org/Grants_and_Awards/GBP/small_renewables_3_03.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://masstech.org/G...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Dobbelaar</member_name><member_id>2225625</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540272000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Energy Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>AltEnergyBoston</urlname><id>219161</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Area Alternative Energy Supporters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1148753218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Area Alternative Energy Supporters June Meetup</name><id>4953854</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1151168400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/AltEnergyBoston/events/4953854/</event_url></item>
