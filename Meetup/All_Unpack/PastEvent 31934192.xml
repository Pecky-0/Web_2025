<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm hiking at a "conversational" pace and welcome hikers to hike with me.&amp;nbsp;(rt: 7.4 miles, 2,550 feet, C rate is slower than the "5.0 booktime").&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is welcome. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Perfect for newer hikers, those getting back on the trail or those like me who need to keep the heart rate down. A conversational pace is where your heart rate does not exceed where you can not carry on a conversation. That means we will be taking breaks as needed and being careful about staying hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A second meetup can be formed for those who would like to hike at a faster pace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the trail, Trail plan may be altered for current conditions. &amp;nbsp;Tagging the summit is a bonus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Hike Plan&lt;/strong&gt; Moosilauke via Gorge Brook Trail.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;This is the most direct and popular route up the mountain. It leaves the Ravine Lodge area either in front of the lodge or from the trail above the car turnaround, crossing the Baker River on the metal bridge. It continues alongside Gorge Brook, crossing twice before arriving at the Last Sure Water area in 1.4 miles. The route from here on was relocated in the early 90's. It then climbs more steeply, joining with an old logging road for a while before hitting a series of switchbacks. There are views of Jobildunk Ravine and then a long exposed section known as the Balcony before hitting East Peak, a ill-defined open area. After a short drop the trail hits treeline and approaches the summit. Total distance is 3.7 miles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Mt. Moosilauke is the most westerly of the New Hampshire 4000ft'rs. In good weather you get great views to the west into Vermont and New York from its bare summit. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 I plan on hiking a trail loop starting and ending at the Ravine lodge. Go up Gorge Brook trail, the most popular trail on Mount Moosilauke. Since Ravine Lodge is the highest trailhead on the mountain, this is the trail with the least elevation gain. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We will descend by either the Carriage Road and Snapper trail ending at the Ravine Lodge. Food and lodging maybe available at the lodge run by Dartmouth College. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Directions to the trailhead: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 From Boston, take I-93 North. &lt;br /&gt;

 After about two hours, get off at Exit 32 in New Hampshire, and turn RIGHT onto Route 112 West (the ramp turns you around to face back south, so turning right takes you west). &lt;br /&gt;

 After 3 miles (passing through the town of North Woodstock), turn LEFT on Route 118 South (it's easy to miss, if you pass the Beaver Brook parking lot or the Lost River Valley Campground, you've gone too far!). &lt;br /&gt;

 After 7.2 miles (winding uphill then starting down the other side), turn RIGHT onto Ravine Road. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Drive all the way to the end of the road (stay to the right at the access road turn-off) and reverse direction in the turn-around. Drive back down and find a parking space on the right side of the road (the western downhill side, closest to the Lodge and Mount Moosilauke). Make sure there's room for buses to pass. Do not park in the turn-around! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Total driving time from Boston, approximately 2.5 hours. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This hike was organized by Diane &amp;nbsp;Mancino. Cell phone 603-477-5116 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 A minimum number of 3 "yes " RSVP's qualifies this as a meetup. &lt;br /&gt;

 All RSVP's must be posted by 9PM the night before the event. Maybe RSVP's will be considered no shows after this time. YOU ARE EXPECTED TO NOTIFY US UF YOU CAN NOT COME. No one would want to be left at the trailhead waiting alone. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Weather cancellations will also be posted by 3 PM the day before the hike and hikers will be notified of the change. &lt;br /&gt;
