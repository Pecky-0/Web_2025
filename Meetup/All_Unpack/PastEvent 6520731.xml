His recital will be the first of many enhanced by new video technology installed thanks to a generous grant from the George F. and Sybil H. Fuller Foundation. The concert is free, and is followed by pipe chamber tours and a reception hosted by the Worcester AGO Chapter. Supported in part by Music &amp;amp; the Arts at All Saints &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Saints is at corner of  Pleasant and Irving Streets, near downtown.   This should be quite a show, and could be quite crowded.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in &amp;quot;Huntington Hall&amp;quot;  by 7:15 to get seats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194140958000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191973978000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Concert of Organ Music - All Saints Church, Worc.</name><id>6520731</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193440500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/6520731/</event_url></item>
