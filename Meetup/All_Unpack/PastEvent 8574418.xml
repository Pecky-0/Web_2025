Organizations attending agreed to immediately start getting out the word about the October 11 action. The October 11 Mobilizing Committee agreed to immediately begin applying for a permit for a rally on Boston Common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have setup various subcommittees which have been meeting and also have a listserv which all are invited to join. The address is:&lt;br /&gt;  oct11boston@googlegroups.com&lt;br /&gt;Plans are being discussed for a website and initial discussions are proceeding around demands and a program. Much is being done and there is much more to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us at our next planning meeting as we prepare to mobilize and demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all occupation forces from Iraq and the closing of all military bases. All are invited.  Looking forward to seeing you all there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, August 23, 3:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;Encuentro 5&lt;br /&gt;33 Harrison Avenue, 5th Floor&lt;br /&gt;Boston (in Chinatown)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Schaich</member_name><member_id>4406518</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Andrews</member_name><member_id>5009779</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Harris</member_name><member_id>5188497</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suren Moodliar</member_name><member_id>5714882</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219691151000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People for Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>stopthewars</urlname><id>708558</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Antiwar</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219119415000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October 11 Planning Meeting</name><id>8574418</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219518000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/stopthewars/events/8574418/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/global_2184137.jpeg</photo_url></item>
