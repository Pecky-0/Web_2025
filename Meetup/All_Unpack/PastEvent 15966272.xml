There are always a lot of people, prizes and answerable questions. We will split up if more than six show up. It is fun to play all together, but we can split up as well. Don't forget food and drink! Trivia does not start until 8pm however it is good to get there early and find a table. It is a pretty small bar so it will be easy to find the Trailblazers. If you are new the Trailblazers or you have not met me you can email me and I can let you know where we will be. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>9389653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294977423000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294459262000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia Night at Kelley's Row</name><id>15966272</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294878600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15966272/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/c/global_2393356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
