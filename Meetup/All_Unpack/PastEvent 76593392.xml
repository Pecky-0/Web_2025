Another HOLIDAY WEEKEND means that you can stay out late on Sunday night and PLAY! Yaaaaaaay! Join us to hear some awesome live music with The Honors!  This is my favorite band in Boston! They play a variety of rock and pop covers.  It's always a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band starts @ 9:30pm but I should be there about 7:00-7:30pm or thereabouts.  There is no cover but proper ID required, 21+.  They do serve food but kitchen closes at 9pm on Sunday so keep that in mind you plan on coming down to eat dinner before the band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Dragon is conveniently located in the Faneuil Hall area on Union Street.  It's next to Haymarket (Orange and Green Lines), across City Hall Plaza from Government Center (Green and Blue Lines), and a short walk to Park Street (Red and Green Lines).  Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO.&lt;/p&gt;
