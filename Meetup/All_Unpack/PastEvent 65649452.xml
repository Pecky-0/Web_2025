&lt;p&gt;Lance Martin (Berklee College of Music) is a superb and very animated flute player who gyrates around the stage as he plays, always putting on a great show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining Lance is Jonathan Singleton (Berklee), Director of the celebrated Mystic Chorale, whose piano interpretations always delight. Rounding out the group is Zeke Martin on drums. As a special treat, they'll be joined by a surprise guest vocalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner, we'll dine at 7pm at the S&amp;amp;S Restaurant very near Ryles. They don't accept reservations for less than 8 people, so we'll all meet there at 7pm. Also, Ryles tells me that reservations are unnecessary as long as we get there somewhat before 9pm, so dining at 7pm should be just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The S&amp;amp;S Restaurant has a FREE parking lot on Hampshire Street at the corner of Prospect Street.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338180235000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337571079000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Lance Martin Band @ Ryles</name><id>65649452</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1338080400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/65649452/</event_url></item>
