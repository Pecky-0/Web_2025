The place itself is totally lovely and surrounded by wonderful countryside. We could also take a ramble around the vineyard if the weather is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A full flight wine tasting is $10 per person; it includes our classic and limited production wines, and the glass may be kept as a souvenir. We also have a $5 tasting available for a taste of any 5 wines (excluding Pontefract wine) and the glass may be kept as a souvenir as well. &lt;br /&gt;You may take a self-guided walk into the vineyard and enjoy the spectacular view at the top, which overlooks a portion of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The website of Sharpe Hill is:&lt;br /&gt;www.sharpehill.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Northrop</member_name><member_id>8657197</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260214675000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257308698000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wine Tasting at Sharpe Hill Vineyard</name><id>11790057</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259438400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/11790057/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_6487468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
