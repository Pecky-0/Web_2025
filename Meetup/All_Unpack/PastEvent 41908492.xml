<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Mt Hayes is one of the 52 with a View list in NH. Its only a 2600 foot mountain but what it lacks in height it make up for with views. It is located at a major bend in the Androscoggin River and sits back a bit from the surrounding mountains. There are several scenic views along the ascent via the Appalachian Trail (referrred to as the Centenial Trail in the AMC guide)&amp;nbsp;looking down over&amp;nbsp;Reflection Pond with steadilly more impressive view of the Shelburne Moriah Range, the&amp;nbsp;Carter Moriah ridge and most importantly the&amp;nbsp;Northern Presidentials (looking south). There is also a&amp;nbsp;great view of the northcountry from the actual peak and we&amp;nbsp;may see a view of the new windturbines to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route down the mountain&amp;nbsp;is not "cast in stone". Dependent upon the group and the interest in a short car spot, we can take a walk down via Mascot Pond on the Mahoosuc Trail or take a different&amp;nbsp;route. The overall length is approximately 8 miles total round trip and its expected that the hike will&amp;nbsp;take 5 hours. We will try to leave the trailhead at 9:30 but may delay a few minutes by doing a car spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are bringing a guest, he or she has to have the appropriate equipment and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetup location is not hard to find. Take RT 16 north to Gorham NH, Take a right on RT 2 and head to Shelburne. Follow Rt 2 until you pass a large water body to your left, the the mountain behind the Pond is Mt Hayes, after the pond take the first left off of RT 2 onto the North Road. Follow North Road over a set of railroad tracks and over the Androscoggin River. Follow the road about 1/4 mile to a "T' in the road and park near the trail signs. If coming over from the West via Rt 2 make sure to follow RT 2 through Gorham until it meets Rt 16 south, then follow the directions. Note there is an Appalachian trail parking area directly on RT 2, if you see this spot you have driven too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no steep climbing on this section with a reasonable grade up the mountain. The total vertcial climb is 1700 feet. The trail does traverse some open rock slabs. I recomend hiking poles for most folks but they are optional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early winter hiking gear is needed. Traction aids such as Kahtohlas or similiar equipment is required. There is a chance for wind at the view points so enough gear to cover all exposed skin and something warm to put on while standing around. Dependent upon the temps that day, be aware that hydration systems, like camelbacks are borderline and may freeze up. Standard water bottles stored inside the pack or in a large wool sock are recomended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hunting season and participants should wear high visibility clothing. White or tan is not recomedned and hunters orange should be&amp;nbsp;brought if you have some.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
