I will start a thread in the message board area to discuss potential meeting topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi Leah and Gretchen - I had an earlier meeting tomorrow from 4-6 that was just extended until 7pm!  So I am moving our permaculture meetup to 7:45...since it's our first meetup, maybe we can just chat about what we'd like to do with future sessions, get to know each other, etc. and wrap up between 8:30 and 9pm if that's fine for you.  Sorry for the last minute switch.  I'm also adding a link to Google Maps for my address to help you find it.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=1002+sawyer+road,+cape+elizabeth,+me" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=1002+sawyer+road,+cape+elizabeth,+me" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540001000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1133210290000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portland Permaculture January Meetup</name><id>4807524</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1136940300000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/4807524/</event_url></item>
