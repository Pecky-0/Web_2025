The fresh air, sun and exercise will do you good - and sadly, one day all this snow will melt &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/crying.gif' border='0' alt='crying' /&gt; so get out and enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open to all abilities, we break up into groups based on experience/fitness. Bring a picnic lunch if you like, there is no food service at Great Brook, just cookies and cocoa.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be INSIDE the barn by the big door and READY TO SKI by 10:00 AM. Great Brook rents all kinds of gear rental fee $13, trail passes are $12, and it is CASH ONLY * CASH ONLY * CASH ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please correspond with each other if you need a ride.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296437574000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295972321000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Brook Saturday</name><id>16179450</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296313200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/16179450/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
