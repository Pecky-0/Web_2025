<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be our third January cooking club and the second anniversary of our group. The theme is comfort food.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our core group is very comfortable with one another and newbies are always brought right into the action and fun.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to be at Paul and Angela's  new home this month so it is a change of venue. I will send out address, parking instructions and directions the Wednesday before the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul and Angela's new home is very comfortable and welcoming (and bigger than my place).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan to cook on site &lt;u&gt;unless&lt;/u&gt; your recipe takes more than 45 minutes to prepare. Do your prep work ahead of time if you like and assemble and cook on site.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring what you would like to drink and share as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to all the great members of this meetup who have made the past two years so fun and memorable! I treasure the friendships that have formed and the good company every month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you in January at Paul's!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1263225019000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260580430000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes January Meetup</name><id>gwhmhyncblb</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262995200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/12068412/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/d/4/global_12192980.jpeg</photo_url></item>
