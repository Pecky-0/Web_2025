&lt;p&gt;Please join us for this popular Permaculture Design Seminar Series which we started offering in 2009. &lt;em&gt;If, after taking this Intro Short Course, you are interested in proceeding to the full Permaculture Design Course (PDC) starting in April, your full fee for this event will be applied toward the PDC fee. This is an affordable and accessible way to get your feet wet and decide if you would like to learn more about the potential for permaculture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: &amp;nbsp;Portland (or within 20m driving from downtown) Residence To Be Confirmed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW: We can take two students for time dollars in lieu of US dollars. Inquire with LisaF if you are interested and are an Hour Exchange Portland member.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in this Intro to Permaculture Design Short Course will meet on two Saturdays (February 18th and 25th) from 9:00 am to approx 3:00 pm at the home of our sample "client" to work through a real, live design process. With our client (who will have completed a questionnaire in advance) we will co-create a practical permaculture design based on their specific goals and the assets and challenges of their site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will come away with a strong foundation for understanding and applying permaculture ethics and design principles. You will have a framework and a process for approaching a residential property from a permaculture perspective. You will feel confident about taking strides on your own property, if applicable, and will dispel that feeling of not knowing "where to start."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space is limited to 10 students. We may repeat this event if there is enough demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some student comments from the last iteration of this seminar:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To my beginner's mind, the challenge elements of this property seemed to be overwhelming and complicated, but in the end Lisa began to bring together aspects of the property's challenges and assets and a design began to synthesize that was manageable and cohesive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am impressed with the way Lisa teaches. It is great fun getting together in a small group like that and learning new things."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was excellent!!! I left the gathering thrilled and excited by all I'd learned."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was a great experience to walk through the initial analysis phase of a permaculture design. I came away with a better understanding of how to approach permacluture design and some of the questions to ask. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was superb. Much more than I could have reasonably expected. I'm very excited. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
