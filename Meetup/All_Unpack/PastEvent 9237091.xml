The Boston Center of Light organizes a celebration for the new year 2009. We will start with a pot luck, followed by a movie or fun activities. Then at 11:30 we will welcome 2009 by praying for world peace. &lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to join us. Let me know if you are interested in coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is usually what  this meet up look like...&lt;br /&gt;We will start with a short reading to contemplate or guided meditation, followed by  silent meditation.  We will have time to discuss our experiences and talk about ways to deepen our practice over some tea.  The whole thing will be about 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting you all and will be happy to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Christine&lt;br /&gt;617-794-8208&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Center of Light is located in Jamaica Plain just around the corner from the Stony Brook T stop on the Orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231375405000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227748284000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Meditation Group December Meetup</name><id>9237091</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230768000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/9237091/</event_url></item>
