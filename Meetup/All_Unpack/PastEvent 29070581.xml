&lt;p&gt;This movie was one of the ones we were interested in for the drive-in event so this is a substiute meetup for that cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IThe movie starts at 6:30 pm, and I'm planning on arriving at a self-serve restaurant with good food on the corner of Church and Brattle streets just down the street from the theatre.&amp;nbsp; I don't remember the name of it.&amp;nbsp; As stated above, I'll plan to arrive there about 5:30 with my Meetup sign.&amp;nbsp; Hope you can join me whenever you can get there.&amp;nbsp; This will be a casual get-together like the drive-in would have been.&amp;nbsp; Looking forward to seeing you there.&lt;/p&gt;
