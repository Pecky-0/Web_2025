<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi, all: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm creating an official Meetup calendar for the retreat simply so that there's a mailing list associated with this event, which actually runs Thursday night-Sunday noon in Madison, CT. I know that not everyone visits the Web site every day, so this way, if there's an important update about the retreat, we can e-mail all of you at once. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've already RSVP'd for everyone who's paid a deposit to attend as well as for the two day guests I know we're expecting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you listed as &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVPs, keep in mind that--in this case--simply changing your RSVP to &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; won't be enough to cancel your participation in this event. The cancellation policy cited in the retreat discussion threads on the Message Board remains in effect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I just created this calendar item so we'd have a mailing list. All the retreat discussion should continue on the Message Board. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Name tag.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224430158000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219596823000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Weekend Retreat in Madison, CT</name><id>8610015</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222383600000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/8610015/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/e/global_4975454.jpeg</photo_url></item>
