&lt;p&gt;Take the Twin River Rd. exit off 146, take a right and follow the road until it turns into Lincoln Woods. :) Â Turn right into the park and park in the lot immediately on the right as you turn in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a nice trail and a place the dogs and take a swim...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled between routes 146 and routes 123 , Lincoln Woods State Park is one of Blackstone Valley's great treasures. A short ride from Providence, Pawtucket, and Cumberland, it is a popular get away for northeastern Rhode Islanders. Visitors can enjoy swimming at the fresh water beach, trout fishing, playing ball, hiking, jogging, horseback riding, or just relaxing under a shade tree. A new addition to the park is the Eastern Mountain Sports kayak school. For more information about the EMS kayak rentals, canoe rentals, and kayaking lessons please click Here or call (800) 310-4504. For information about the new riding stable at the park click Here. A New Covered Bridge at the Breakneck Hill Entrance has been dedicated in the spring of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1340412067000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339004957000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Afternoon Walks!
