There were 50-some of you out there with interest, hopefully more will join us next time.  Wednesday night seemed to be a hardship for many, so I have moved the &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; meetings to the second Tuesday of the month with the next date being November 13th.  The Wood-n-Tap has been very gracious in providing us a meeting room at no charge, so we will meet there once again.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the last meeting we spoke about the expectation for the direction of the group and future activities.  Obviously everyone wants to work on their conversational Russian, so I recommend bringing a pocket dictionary to the meeting if you are a beginner like me.  Hopefully we have a few people with stronger skills (and patience) to help move the conversations along.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second only to interest in conversation, was an interest in culture.  Hopefully those group members who have traveled to Russia or have had the pleasure of spending time with Russian people will be willing to share their experiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I envision always integrating conversation and culture in our Meetups.  Additionally, we discussed presentations on Russian culture, grammar and history, the possibility of researching and throwing some culturally correct holiday parties, and having a Russian cuisine &amp;quot;pot-luck&amp;quot; dinner by establishing a menu of appetizers, soups, entrees and deserts and then all attendees picking a dish or two off a list to bring for the group.  We also talked of traveling to cultural events in Massachusetts and NY and the future possibility of working through a travel agent to plan a group trip to Russia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all great ideas, but we need participation to be successful.  All of you receiving this notification had interest and asked to be advised if the group got started.  It has started, so &amp;quot;cowboy-up&amp;quot; and join us!  The atmosphere is relaxed and casual and will stay that way.  I intend for this too be fun! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second Meetup will be much like the first; initially a mixer and later slightly more organized discussion regarding expectations, direction and future activities.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, please don't miss out on this opportunity because you are a beginner.  Even if you know only a few words or phrases, please join us.  I am a beginner and we will likely do a lot of translating back and forth so no one is left behind.  The only way to improve is to relax and speak!  (If you have trouble relaxing, The Wood-n-Tap Staff assured me that they will keep a few extra bottles of vodka on-hand for our Meet-up night and we can arrange carpools!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to seeing you on the 13th! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Anderson</member_name><member_id>1738935</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542374000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Russian Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordrussianmeetup</urlname><id>723352</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Russian Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192282977000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hartford Russian Language Meetup Group</name><id>6542216</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194998400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordrussianmeetup/events/6542216/</event_url></item>
