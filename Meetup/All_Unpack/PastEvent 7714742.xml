Rising above the horizon, Great Blue Hill reaches a height of 635 feet, the highest of the 22 hills in the Blue Hills chain. (&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/d..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;We will follow the Skyline Trail, which has many fantastic views of the Boston skyline. This one-way hike is considered MODERATE. It will cover about 7.7 miles and according to the AMC it should take an average hiker about 4 hours 15 minutes +/- to complete it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 9:00 AM at the Park &amp;amp; Ride lot on west end of the Skyline Trail in Canton. The parking lot is located on the west side of Blue Hill Avenue/Route 138 about 1/2 mile north of Route I- 93. This is primarily a commuter lot so try and park towards the back of the lot.  Since this is where we will end our hike, we will leave a few cars there and make the short drive to the east end of the trail (Shea Skating Rink, Willard St. Quincy, MA) where we will start our hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to coordinate ride sharing please indicate in your RSVP if you are able to give a ride or if you are looking to get one. All RSVPs must be updated by noon of the day before this event. A MAYBE will be changed to a NO at that time so that others have the opportunity to participate. Changes or cancellations will be posted on the calendar by 6:00 PM the night before the event and those members who responded YES or MAYBE will also be notified via email. &lt;br /&gt;Please contact me if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I drive a gold Honda Accord MA tags 56H S58.
