&lt;em&gt;The Debt&lt;/em&gt; begins in 1997, as shocking news reaches retired Mossad secret agents Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stephan (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague David (Ciar&amp;aacute;n Hinds). All three have been venerated for decades by Israel because of the secret mission that they embarked on for their country back in 1965-1966, when the trio&amp;mdash;portrayed, respectively, by Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthington&amp;mdash;tracked down Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), the feared Surgeon of Birkenau, in East Berlin. While Rachel found herself grappling with romantic feelings during the mission, the net around Vogel was tightened by using her as bait. At great risk, the team's mission was accomplished&amp;mdash;or was it? The suspense builds across two different time periods, with startling action and surprising revelations that compel Rachel to take matters into her own hands. Academy Award nominee John Madden 
&lt;em&gt;(Shakespeare in Love)&lt;/em&gt; directs this espionage thriller, which was adapted from the 2007 Israeli film 
&lt;em&gt;Ha-Hov&lt;/em&gt;. (Partially subtitled)
