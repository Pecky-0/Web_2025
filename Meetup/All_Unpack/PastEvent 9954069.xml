I am looking to get a lot of people together for a full day of Top Roping. I plan to get there before 10 and set up my own ropes so that they will be ready to go at ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need at least a few more experienced climbers with their own ropes and anchors so we have multiple routes to work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New climbers are welcome though I encourage you to bring your own gear (harness, shoes, belay device) and I ask that you take a belay course at a local gym. Both Metrorock and Boston Rock Gym have nightly belay classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress warm and bring a bag lunch. I will bring a stove so we can boil water for cocoa. Bring your own mug!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please answer the questions on the RSVP so I know who will be bring additional ropes and so we can set up a carpool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For directions and cliff description, go to this site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/Massachusetts/Greater_Boston/Quincy_Quarries/" target="_blank"&gt;RC.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be the guy in the red Down Coat.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pete</member_name><member_id>4925014</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237852749000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237058690000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring Climbing at Quincy Quarry</name><id>9954069</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237644000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/9954069/</event_url></item>
