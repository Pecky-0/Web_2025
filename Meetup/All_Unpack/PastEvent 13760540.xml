<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;br /&gt;How about a meetup to Fishers on Thursday July 1 (also known as Canada Day....eh).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll do a late afternoon flyout, Bill and Sheila would be there to shuttle people to their house there and we could do burgers, dogs, sausage etc hey, er, ya know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should bring some salads, etc as getting loads of food to the island has its challenges, so airplanes are a good way to do it!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Taylors have gratiously also offered to pick up the cost of the landing fee, $8 per single, as a gesture of invitation to come see their little bit of paradise. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;an intro to Fishers Island&amp;quot; Great little airport with a fun approach. The island is a hidden gem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to kick off the weekend! Did someone say &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Taylor's First Annual Fishers Island Canada Day Celebration, eh&amp;quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP for this one. Rent, Borrow, or...er...whatever... But don't miss this one.. It's a short hop and a fun one! ... Rain date for the following day, Friday July 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.navmonster.com/map/KFIT-0B8-10" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.navmonster...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bill and Sheila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet you at Elizabeth Airfield and transport you to our house ph: 631-788-7106</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>William Taylor</member_name><member_id>6716262</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278154841000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276186655000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fishers Island , Canada Day, with the Taylors...eh</name><id>13760540</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278019800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/13760540/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/7/global_15624935.jpeg</photo_url></item>
