<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy talking with other music lovers about the first band they adored, the one song or album they are currently listening to on repeat, and the awesome concerts they have attended. I think it would be fun to have an event where members can get together to discuss as well as share music with the hopes of getting to know some of the people in this group better and exposing ourselves to some awesome new bands.
