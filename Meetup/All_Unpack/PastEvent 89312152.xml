&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the Grails48 global Hackathon is coming up quickly and it'd be great for the Boston Grails community to be involved. The Hackathon will occur the weekend of November 9th, starting at 5pm and ending that Sunday, the 11th. The event organizers have been claiming via Twitter that this is already the largest JVM-based hackthon ever; let's see if we can increase that number. If you'd like to participate, head over to &lt;a href="http://www.grails48.com" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.grails48.com&lt;/a&gt; and register!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

This meetup will occur the day before, Thursday the 8th at 7pm, for the purpose of planning. I think it'll be a great opportunity for us to get together in order to discuss potential hack ideas and form small teams. Those of you who are interested, please stop by!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, VMWare has graciously offered to host this meetup at their office in Kendall Square. Hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Pember</member_name><member_id>9587085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352430845000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Grails-Boston</urlname><id>1458975</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Boston Grails Users' Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351687502000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grails48 Discussion and Planning</name><id>89312152</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352419200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Grails-Boston/events/89312152/</event_url></item>
