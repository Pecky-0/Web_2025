I'm addicted to those prickly pear Margaritas! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get out of work around 3pm that day and I'm sure many of you will be free around that time as well.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zuma's is downstairs in the North Market building at Faneuil Hall.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'll be in the bar area wearing a green scarf around my neck.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: yellow"&gt;I have a bright yellow LL Bean ski jacket that will be hanging from my chair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check out Zuma's Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zumatexmexgrill.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.zumatexmex...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie and I are going to see the &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blue Man Group at 10pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Feel free to join us for that as well!  Get tix ahead of time before it's sold out, or take your chances that day at the BosTix Booth for half-price tix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the Blue Man Group's website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blueman.com/tickets/boston" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.blueman.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of night:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;I plan to have a couple of Margarita's and get a bite to eat at Zuma's from around 3ish to 5ish, then maybe go to The Common to check out the ice sculptures around 6ish, then see the movie, &amp;quot;The Reader&amp;quot;, at Loews Tremont Street theater near Boston Common at 7pm to kill off two hours and to stay warm, then go to the Blue Man Group show at 10pm.  Group hug at midnight.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: black"&gt;Feel free to call me that night at 617-999-9094.  If you happen to get my voicemail, please leave a message and I'll call you back.  I'll check my voicemail often that night.  I'll need to shut off my phone for the 7pm movie and for the 10pm show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress casual, in comfortable shoes for walking, in layers for cold weather, in case we spend some time outside between 5pm to 10pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no group tab because people will be coming and going at various times, so a group tab doesn't work out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the bar area with a green scarf around my neck and a yellow jacket.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>2969721</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231457707000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nightlife-421</urlname><id>505098</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Happy Hour</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230043293000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last Happy Hour for 2008!</name><id>9379919</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230753600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/events/9379919/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/4/global_6661524.jpeg</photo_url></item>
