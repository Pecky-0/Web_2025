 &lt;br /&gt;

When you go out to social gatherings (such as a meetup event), do you often wish that people would see through your shyness and take the time to discover the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you that's hiding inside?   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you answered "yes" to either of these questions, then you're going to love this.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

In this unique event, you'll learn the secrets to becoming more interesting and attractive so that you can experience the kind of effortless connections that you've been hoping for when you go out to socialize.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

*NOTE* - This class is not just for singles, by the way.  Whether you're in a relationship or not, you'll get a lot of benefit from what we cover.  You can use these ideas and techniques at social events, in a relationships, and certainly at work.  So if you're partnered up, don't be shy.  Come join us :) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

*************************************************   &lt;br /&gt;

HERE'S A SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:   &lt;br /&gt;

*************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The single most important ability you must develop in order to be interesting and attractive to other people. Once you master &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;, you'll have a never ending supply of quality people wanting to spend more time with you.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My proven method for instantly make people feel closer you. You can use this for dating, friendship, and even business, and people will find themselves making excuses to spend more time with you.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "secret question" that everyone's subconscious mind is asking when you first meet them. Once you know this, you'll be able to put people at ease and make them feel comfortable around you.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple steps you can take right away to make yourself more physically attractive. If you do this, be prepared to get a lot more compliments on your appearance!   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*************************************************   &lt;br /&gt;

PERSONALITY FEEDBACK   &lt;br /&gt;

*************************************************   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

And that's just the first part of the seminar. Then we will go into one of the most popular activities that we do in this group... personality feedback!   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

You will have an opportunity to participate in small group evaluations of other members, and you'll also get to experience what it's like to receive both positive encouragement and constructive feedback about how you come across to others.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This is often the most revealing part of the workshop, because it's so personalized. Some members became aware of things they were doing for years that were turning people off, and some learned that they come across much better than they realized (which dramatically boosted their confidence in all social situations).   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/span&gt; I want you to know that exercise is done very gently, kindly, and in the spirit of personal growth. We are all there to help each other. So if this section makes you a little nervous, don't let it. I promise that you will find this to be one of the most educational and &lt;span&gt;enjoyable&lt;/span&gt; parts of the seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

*************************************************    &lt;br /&gt;

HOW TO GET INVOLVED    &lt;br /&gt;

*************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Where is it?&lt;/strong&gt; The seminar is conveniently located at the Watertown Center For Healing Arts which is a beautiful facility for an event like this.    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;What time?&lt;/strong&gt; Please plan on arriving by 6:45pm so you have time to settle in and meet the other members. We start promptly at 7:00pm and go until 9:30pm (with a break in the middle).  There are plenty of bus lines that go to the center, and there is also lots of parking both on the street and in a big parking lot near the center.  The bottom of this page has details:    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://watertowncenter.net/directions-2/"&gt;http://watertowncenter.net/directions-2/    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much?&lt;/strong&gt; Cheap.  If you took a class like this through an adult education center, you'd easily pay more than $50 to attend, and that's assuming there even &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a class that could offer you all this, which there isn't.      &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

No other class offers you this kind of cutting edge training that's based in real world results.  This stuff WORKS!  What if one small change is all it takes to immediately and effortlessly begin attracting high-quality friends and dating prospects into your life?  I've seen it happen many times in this group, and it can happen for you too.     &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;So how much?&lt;/strong&gt; Because I want to help as many people as I can, I've decided to keep the price very affordable so that anyone who wants to come will be able to.  The cost for this event is only $20, which is very low considering the quality of training that you'll be getting.    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Think about it... &lt;strong&gt;that's 67 cents a day for a month&lt;/strong&gt;.  What else do you spend 67 cents on every day that makes no difference in your social life (or love life) whatsoever? I promise that this will be well worth your time.    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;How big is the class?&lt;/strong&gt; In order to make sure I can personally help as many people as possible, the class is limited to the first 50 people who RSVP.  The personality feedback exercises take up a lot of room, so I really do have to limit size.  I'm listing this event in two groups, so there are over 7,300 people seeing this listing.  If you want in, then be sure to put in your RSVP right now in order to lock in your spot.   &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please remember to bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$20 cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great attitude, and a willingness to learn fun, new things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and put in your RSVP right now in order to secure your spot.  I'm looking forward to seeing you there.    &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Warmly,     &lt;br /&gt;
