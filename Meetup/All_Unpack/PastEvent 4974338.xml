<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>sorry about short notice but after all the rain it's great to get out! This is an moderate to easy roughly 2.5 mile hike that includes a relatively scenic view from the summit of Lookout Mountain (a.k.a. Case Mt., 744 ft.). Portions of the trail include the Shenipsit Trail. The start of the hike from the parking lot is somewhat steep but after that it is much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is anticipated to last 1.5 hour and rise 350 feet. Overall the hike should start at 5:15 PM and be done by about 6:45 PM. We'll meet in the parking lot. A map can be found as hike #6 in the &amp;quot;50 Hikes in Connecticut&amp;quot; book by the Connecticute Forest and Parks Association. There is no meal planed for after this one (Leader has a meeting to get to, sorry!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this hike is Kevin S so please direct questions on the hike to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Hartford:&lt;br /&gt;* Take I-84 E to I-384&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 4 off of I-384 (Highland St.)&lt;br /&gt;* From the end of the Exit ramp, right onto Spring St.&lt;br /&gt;* Go about 0.2 mile and make a sharp left and you'll see a small parking lot at the bottom of the hill on your left.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1150320258000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1150030296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike to Highland Springs and Lookout Mountain in Manchester CT</name><id>4974338</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1150146900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/4974338/</event_url></item>
