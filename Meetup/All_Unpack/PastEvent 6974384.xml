<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 100 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 9 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 9:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;* North on Merit Pkwy get off at exit 59.&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp turn left on Whalley ave. &lt;br /&gt;* Take first right turn onto Pond Lilly.&lt;br /&gt;** Go up hill &amp;amp; take first right turn onto Valley St. &lt;br /&gt;* Follow Valley St about 1 mile to the intersection of Blake St.&lt;br /&gt;* There is a traffic light at Blake street so turn left onto Blake street &amp;amp; go a short distance &amp;amp; turn left into Blake Street Center.&lt;br /&gt;* We meet in the back parking lot for the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* South on Merit Pkwy get off at exit 59.&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp turn right onto Whalley Ave.&lt;br /&gt;* Go under Merit Pkwy &amp;amp; turn left on Pond Lilly.&lt;br /&gt;* Follow rest of directions(**).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location/directions via MapQuest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;addtohistory=&amp;amp;address=490%20Blake%20St&amp;amp;city=New%20Haven&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;zipcode=06515%2d1286&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;geodiff=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
