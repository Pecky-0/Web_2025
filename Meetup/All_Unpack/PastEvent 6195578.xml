She has informed me of the following Rakugo performances being performed in the Boston area towards the end of the month.  Rakugo is a very impressive form of traditional Japanese comedic theater involving only a single person performing in front of an audience.  Please try your best to make it to one of these performances since it really is a rare treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, let me just say that we will miss you SOOOO much, Yutaka!
