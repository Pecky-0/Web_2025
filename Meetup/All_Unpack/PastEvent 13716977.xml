The Bikeway extends 10.7 miles, from County Road in North Falmouth to the Steamship Authority's Ferry terminal in Woods Hole, a historic seaside fishing village and the site of several major research institutions. It also connects at a number of points to the network of designated Bike Routes across Falmouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bikeway traverses salt marshes, cranberry bogs, ponds and woodlands; it skirts sandy shores and a busy working harbor. Its course includes numerous intriguing geological features. It is also the only bikeway on Cape Cod that has a section along the seashore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Boston:&lt;br /&gt;Take route 24 south to 1-495 south to the Bourne Bridge. Or take Route 3 south to the Sagamore Bridge Rotary. Follow signs to Buzzards Bay/Falmouth, then cross the Bourne Bridge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Bourne Bridge to Depot Ave. Bikeway Parking in Falmouth Village:&lt;br /&gt;Continue on Rt. 28 into Falmouth Village. Turn right on Depot Ave (just beyond Queen's Buyway and Corner Cycle on the left). Just past the Enterprise Newspapers building enter the Depot Ave. parking lot, directly alongside the Bikeway.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277649043000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Leisure Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-235</urlname><id>527341</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Boston Leisure Bicycling</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275857525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Shining Sea Bikeway</name><id>13716977</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277571600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-235/events/13716977/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/1/global_1549089.jpeg</photo_url></item>
