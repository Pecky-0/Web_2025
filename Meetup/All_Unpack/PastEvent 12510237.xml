These fun games could turn into your next story, especially since this week we will be attempting to brainstorm at Tavern on the Square in Porter!tav&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 rotating taps, fried pickles, and writing. Oh, heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of food...When you are RSVPing, please keep in mind that this is a sit-down restaurant, so we should all order something - even if we're just having drinks and pitching in for table appetizers. Also, please ONLY RSVP 'Yes' if you KNOW you can be there. I need to call ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me, and the fried pickles!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1265933398000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265229806000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Writing Exercises and Fried Pickles</name><id>12510237</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265760000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/12510237/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
