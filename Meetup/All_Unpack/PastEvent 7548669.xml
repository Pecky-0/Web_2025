<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will finish Locke's essay with its 4th (last) book at our last two meetings on this text. For next time let's cover about half of the 4th book Of Knowledge and Probability. Half is about chapters 1(Of Knowledge in General) through 8 (Of Trifling Propositions). After Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding we plan to continue with Leibniz's chapter by chapter answer to this work (New Essays Concerning Human Understanding). We will decide at our next two meetings what parts or what abridged version of this work we will use.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you soon!&lt;br /&gt;Andras&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206876758000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205757653000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Locke: An Essay Concerning Human Understanding V</name><id>7548669</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206658800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/7548669/</event_url></item>
