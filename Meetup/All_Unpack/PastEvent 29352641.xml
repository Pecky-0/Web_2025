&lt;p&gt;The race begins at 9am on Saturday September 18th.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**PARKING FILLS UP QUICKLY!***
 &lt;br /&gt;I listed the event time for 8am.&amp;nbsp; This gives time to meet, pick up your number and Tshirt, stop in the bathrooms before the lines are long, walk around and stretch, all without any stress of missing the starting gun.&amp;nbsp; Plus, this early you can actually get a parking space at the Woodsdale School.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you call can make this great event and stay around for a fun after race party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
