It is free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me knows that I&amp;nbsp;love chocolate. And that I have&amp;nbsp;toured the Taza Chocolate factory in Somerville (more than once!). Chocolate produced&amp;nbsp;organically and under free-trade auspices is truly guilt-free eating. (I'll check, but I think free-trade organic chocolate still contains calories.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what the Harvard Food Literacy Project had to say about &lt;em&gt;Chocolate Country&lt;/em&gt; via e-mail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*****In the isolated hill towns of the Dominican Republic, cacao farmers (who sell to Somerville-based Taza Chocolate) have been fighting a losing battle with the global economy for as long as anyone can remember. But in Loma Guaconejo, things are about to change. If the farmers here can win organic&amp;nbsp;certification and market their product directly to the United States, they&amp;nbsp;just might manage to turn the system on its head. But to pull it off will take the effort of an entire community. (30 mins.) (Grand Jury Prize , Short Documentary, Seattle Film Festival.) We'll enjoy Taza Chocolate while we watch it (of course!).&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All films will be screened on Fridays at lunchtime (12 noon to 1 p.m.) in Dana Palmer House (16 Quincy Street), Room 102. Bring your lunch. Appropriately themed snacks will be provided.*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can bring your lunch to this movie. I'm&amp;nbsp;guessing that the portions of&amp;nbsp;Taza Chocolate served by the Harvard Food Literacy Project&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;get me craving for more, so we can go out&amp;nbsp;for some type of chocolate treat in Harvard Square after the movie, if that's what people would like to do. Or we could go out for lunch. The movie is one half hour long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will arrive at&amp;nbsp;the Dana Palmer House&amp;nbsp;early; my plan is to arrive between 11:30 and 11:45 a.m. I'll be carrying my bright red backpack &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; likely wearing my chocolate-brown Taza T-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for me after the movie. I'll try to gather everyone, and then we can decide if we would like to go out&amp;nbsp;in Harvard Square. The Algiers Coffee House at 40 Brattle Street serves iced chocolate, chocoate cake. You can also eat lunch there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at the Dana Palmer House!&lt;/p&gt;
