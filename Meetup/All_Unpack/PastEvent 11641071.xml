This is one of our favorite walking locations.  We usually donate a portion of our event fees to the upkeep of PMP.  We will be meeting on the Braintree side of PMP by the flagpole near the Ranger Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should be able to walk around the loop twice which totals 3.5 miles altogether and takes about 1 hr 5mins - 1 hr 15 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Please Note: There are only two entrances to PMP - in Braintree and Weymouth.  There is only one place to meet on the path and that's where the Braintree and Weymouth paths converge.  If we walk against the flow of traffic and you will be more than 10 minutes late you could potentially meet us at the merge as we will wait 5-10 minutes for late (Yes RSVP) arrivals, and within 5-10 minutes of our departure we will pass the convergence of the paths.  However, if we walk the right away we won't pass that point until almost 1/2 hour into our walk.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loop is 1.6 miles, with the walk to and from the parking lot it is 1.9 miles.  It takes about 35-40 minutes to walk the loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this time is too early/late for you and you would like to walk PMP please note it in your RSVP so we may note your feedback for scheduling future walks and events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: Today is their Annual Pumpkin Festival so there may be more traffic than usual.  (Feel free to arrive a few minutes early to get a pumpkin.)  We will wait about 5 minutes to no more than 10 minutes for late arrivals.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday Afternoon Walk @ Pond Meadow Park&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, October 17th, 2009 @ 2pm&lt;br /&gt;Pond Meadow Park&lt;br /&gt;470 Liberty Street&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184&lt;br /&gt;No phone #.&lt;br /&gt;www.pondmeadowpark.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fee: Annual Members - FREE, Members and Guests - $2 per person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer(s): Angela and Julie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: At  least 4 Yes RSVPs by 8pm on Friday, October 16th.  Attendance is unlimited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests: Welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Please finalize your RSVP by 11am on Saturday, October 17th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: Heavy rains will cancel.  We will walk if it is overcast or there is a slight drizzle.  Please plan to bring a lightweight jacket with a hood just in case.  (We will do my best to notify everyone if this event is cancelled around the RSVP Deadline.)  Please Note: This is the weather alternative event for the Beginner-Friendly Hike @ World's End.  If we do go Hiking this Walk will be cancelled.  If we do not go Hiking then we will most likely Walk unless the Organizers decide it is too wet to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Best directions should be taken from mapquest.com or maps.google.com. Located on Liberty Street, 500 feet from the intersection of Liberty and Middle Street near the Route 3 overpass directly across from Zana Park Drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note there is a rotary now instead of a regular intersection just before PMP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Route 3: Take Exit 17/Union St., Braintree.  Exit on the side of the (Sunoco) Gas Station and Police Station.  Follow Union Street to the first set of lights.  Take a Right at the lights onto Middle Street.  Follow about 1 mile to a Rotary.  Go 3/4 of the way around the Rotary and exit onto Liberty Street.  (This used to be a regular intersection where you took a left.)  PMP is 500 feet up on the Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet by the flagpole near the ranger station and map.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>4336960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256247938000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255702691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Afternoon Walk @ Pond Meadow Park</name><id>11641071</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255802400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/11641071/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/8/global_3818056.jpeg</photo_url></item>
