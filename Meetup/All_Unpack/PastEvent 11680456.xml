Visitors will be able to talk to and make purchases directly from the artists while touring the creative environments in which the artwork is produced. The weekend-long event also provides a great opportunity to sample many of this historic neighborhood's restaurants, cafes, pubs, and retail shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Numerous disciplines will be represented throughout the dozens of participants, including: sculpture, painting, drawing, printmaking, installation, photography, video, jewelry, ceramics, woodworking, fabric and performance art. Much of the work will be in-process and the artists will be on hand for questions and conversations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is free to the public, rain or shine, noon to 6pm each day. Public transportation is easy, take the Red Line to Broadway and walk East, or take the #7 City Point bus from South Station to Elkins St.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.southbostonopenstudios.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Boston Open Studios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll be at the Distillery Gallery until 1:30pm and then wander.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a magenta silk scarf.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cristin</member_name><member_id>603739</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257529961000</updated><rating><average>3.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256157385000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Boston Open Studios!</name><id>11680456</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257098400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/11680456/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/a/global_11345562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
