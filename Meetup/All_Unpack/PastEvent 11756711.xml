You will learn how to cure your piece to prevent distortion as well as how to prepare a non-toxic jeweler’s resin to preserve your piece. A number of techniques and tips will be covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle caps and resin are provided. Students are welcome to bring additional materials including papers and found objects. These can also be purchased at Abeille at a 10% discount along with any findings to transform your bottle caps into pins, rings, pendants, cuff links or earrings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that resin needs 24 hours to cure so it’s best to leave your materials over night to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dates: Sunday, November 29 at 3pm&lt;br /&gt;Duration: 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;Fee: $35&lt;br /&gt;Skill Level: 14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To register please call Abeille at 617.232.4343 or for more information visit our website Abeille!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abeille</member_name><member_id>9604034</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259700844000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Crafters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondiycrafts</urlname><id>1301641</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Jewelry Design and DIY Crafts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257014691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bottle Cap Jewelry</name><id>11756711</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259526600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondiycrafts/events/11756711/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/d/a/global_11536826.jpeg</photo_url></item>
