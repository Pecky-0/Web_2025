O'Neill Bike Path, also known as the South County Bike Path, is the state's fourth-longest bike path, stretching 7.8 miles from Kingston Station in the village of West Kingston in South Kingstown to Mumford Road in Narragansett. The path is envisioned to connect Kingston Station to the Narragansett shore, and future studies will consider an extension of the path toward Narragansett Town Beach and spurs toward Kingstown Village and URI. As the path follows the former rail corridor, it is mostly flat with a gradual slope down heading from west to east. Meeting with the ideals of the late Senator O'Neill, the path is immediately adjacent or very close to four schools, including the University of Rhode Island. Cycling the path takes approximately 45 minutes in each direction. Heading from west to east, beginning at Kingston Station:ingston village and the University of Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
