<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 100 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 8:00 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 8:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;South on Merit Parkway&lt;br /&gt;* Off at exit 59.&lt;br /&gt;* Right at end of ramp &amp;amp; then 1st  left onto Pond Lilly&lt;br /&gt;* Pick up directiond blow at **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;North on Merit&lt;br /&gt;* Off at exit 59.&lt;br /&gt;* Left on Whaley, right on Pond Lilly.&lt;br /&gt;** 1st right onto Valley&lt;br /&gt;* Left at second light onto Blake St.&lt;br /&gt;* Left into Blake St. Center.&lt;br /&gt;* Meet rear parking lot of school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
