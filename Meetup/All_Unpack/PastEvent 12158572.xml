This is by no means a pristine wilderness as it is within a mid-size suburban town. It's a good area for family hikes in the summer with youngsters and snowshoeing in winter. There is an excellent set of beaver dams near the trailhead! Throughout the open areas of the preserve, there are frequent hawk sightings. The trails are notably muddy in springtime, and into summer if weather has been wet, but it dries out as the elevation slightly rises after about a half-mile. Be prepared and dress accordingly for hunters in fall. Trails are fairly obvious and moderately well marked.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maps of the area and other information can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.hhnp.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hhnp.org...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Everett Turnpike to exit 11; exit toward west. At the intersection of Continental Boulevard and Amherst Road, head north onto Amherst Road. Travel three to four miles; the park entrance will be on left and is well marked. Parking lot will fit about 20 vehicles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Gray Honda Civic </how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263827319000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262009919000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Horse Hill Preserve   Snowshoe winter hike</name><id>12158572</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263654000000</time><rsvp_limit>27</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12158572/</event_url></item>
