<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I am planning a 3 to 4 hour hike through Bigelow Hollow.  This is a familiar area with beautiful terrain and no terrible ups.  Please plan on bringing water and snacks for this adventure.  Hopefully some of you who made noise about wanting to winter hike will come and have a great experience.  Don't be the one looking at the pictures later and saying, I wish I had gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigelow Hollow State Park and the adjoining Nipmuck State Forest offer over 9,000 acres of recreation opportunities, including miles of hiking trails and an 18-acre pond in Eastern Connecticut. This park is beautiful, and this is a great time of year to hike it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet at 9:30 AM at the I-84 exit 68 &amp;quot;park and ride&amp;quot; lot for those who want to carpool to save gas. We'll get to the park entrance by 9 AM. The hike will last about 4 hours and end by 2 PM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to skip the meeing place and head straight to the park, there should not be a charge to enter the park.  When you enter the park, head up the road and we will meet at the 2nd parking area along the road from the entrance, which is a picnic area. It will be on your left side as you drive in (it has the water pump, 2 dark colored outhouses, and a bulletinboard). On the map, it is the 3rd marked parking area from the entrance. If you reach the boat launch and the end of the accessible road you've gone one parking area too far. In the event the parking area is full, we will still meet at that location as the trailhead we are using is there. Please allow some extra time in case you need to walk to this area from available parking. Note that there is virtually NO CELL reception at the park!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location/directions for entrance to Bigelow Hollow State Park off of Rte. 171 in Union, CT via Mapquest: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?name=Bigelow+Pond&amp;amp;city=Stafford+Springs&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=41.99204&amp;amp;longitude=-72.131743&amp;amp;geocode=ADDRESS&amp;amp;id=13881594" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking map: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/stateparks/maps/big_nipm.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough indication of topography via Google Maps (click Terrain button, if needed):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Bigelow+Hollow+State+Park,+Union,+CT&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.002908,-72.132711&amp;amp;spn=0.016775,0.023947&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the park: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&amp;amp;q=325174&amp;amp;depNav_GID=1650" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
