We are hoping to meet twice a month, both on the 2nd and 4th Mondays.  If this month works well, we will continue this.  Which may mean we would need additional help leading the groups, since Reece and I can't always make it 2 times on Mondays.  If you would like to help out with the meet ups, please respond to Reece by pressing Contact me on the left side of the screen under her picture.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bi- monthly meetings to practice Mandarin conversation. Learners of all levels, and native speakers welcome!&lt;br /&gt;This is an opportunity to meet with other learners and practice whatever you'd like to work on. Bring any books or homework you would like to review, and ask a native speaker to help you with pronounciation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: (a member says that Mapquest directions are confusing)&lt;br /&gt;BCNC is at 38 Ash St., off of Oak St. between Washington St. and Harrison Ave.&lt;br /&gt;Oak St. is between Kneeland St. and Marginal Way (alongside the Turnpike)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest T stop is Orange Line New England Medical Center. &lt;br /&gt;Walk toward the South End (away from Chinatown) on Washington St and take the first left onto Oak St. The entrance to the building is in Ash St., the first small street on the left. There's a sign for BCNC- Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. Sign in at the front desk and ask for the Meetup conversation group.&lt;br /&gt;Parking is limited in the area, due to the theater district, but sometimes you can find spaces on the surrounding blocks. There are pay lots on Kneeland and Tremont Streets.&lt;br /&gt;The phone number in case you get lost is 617-635-5129.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.bcnc.net" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bcnc.net" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bcnc.net...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185402792000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184024312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chinese Language (4th Monday) July Meetup</name><id>5998046</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185229800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/5998046/</event_url></item>
