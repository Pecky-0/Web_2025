If you don't have fun here, then I've failed as an organizer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll get CAKE...I'm offering 5 great things in a RAFFLE, and will be handing out fun and funny DOOR PRIZES, too! AND I have FREE appetizer coupons!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come on...don't be a party pooper!  RSVP by Thurs, Feb 8th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday's was just remodeled and their bar area is just great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to get the room to the left of the bar.  Look for me, I'll be the one with the PARTY HAT! At the door, ask for the &amp;quot;birthday party.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hour prices at the bar 5 - 7 pm, 10 to close. Great menu too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171234945000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Connecticut Arts - Theatre Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Theatre-Group</urlname><id>326612</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>Connecticut Theatre Group Arts-Theater Events Group Discount</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1166551671000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February Happy Hour at T.G.I.
