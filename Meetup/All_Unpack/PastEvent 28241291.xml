Located in Salem, NH, no one knows for sure exactly what this place is, who built it or why. Their website (www.stonehengeusa.com) says: &amp;#147;Built by a Native American Culture or a migrant European population? No one knows for sure. A maze of man-made chambers, walls and ceremonial meeting places, America's Stonehenge is most likely the oldest man-made construction in the United States (over 4000 years old).&amp;#148; Come with us and explore the roughly &amp;amp;frac12; mile of trails and rock formations and tunnels. This is an open event so bring friends, family, children. The site has some adorable alpacas, a concession stand and gift shop. Admission rates are: Adults: $10.00, Seniors(65+): $9.00, Children Ages 6-12: $7.00, Children 5 and Under: Free. Please let me know if you would like to carpool there &amp;#150; the ride is about 1 hour &amp;#150; or if you need directions to get there on your own. We will be leaving from KRI promptly at 10am. I highly recommend bringing dowsing rods and/or a pendulum, and a camera.
