There could be wet sand, dirt paths, rocky hills, grassy knolls, stair climbs - plus great music and people along the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, you can celebrate with great food and a free beer for participating! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadline to register for the June event is June 13. There will be one held on July 30 and August 27 as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't once you've done one, you've done them all -- No course is the same!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the website for more information on registering, the race, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245535544000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>5K-Runners-Meetup</urlname><id>1354697</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>5K Runners Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244210134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Xtreme Scrambles 5k Series Events</name><id>10582926</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245362400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/5K-Runners-Meetup/events/10582926/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/8/global_6885384.jpeg</photo_url></item>
