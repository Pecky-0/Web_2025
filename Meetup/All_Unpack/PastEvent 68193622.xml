<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;It's official, we are on for our next meeting on TUESDAY, June 19th at 7 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to go over an article on baleotherapy (hot water therapy) with everyone that was in the last Fibromyalgia Network News periodical.  There are so many options out there for relieving our pain but this one is tried and true and studied thoroughly.  Getting in hot water is a free and useful therapeutic treatment! Studies show that after just a few weeks this treatment can have lasting benefits even if the therapy is stopped. I'll have reprints of the article to share if you don't already get this super periodical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and talk about your triumphs and challenges so we might share the journey and learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betsy&lt;/p&gt;
