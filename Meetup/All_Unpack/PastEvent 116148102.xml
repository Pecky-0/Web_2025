&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concert This Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us on Tuesday evening for an inspiring program of song and text. Fifty voices from the Copley Singers and the Saint Cecilia Choir join together in a program which progresses from consolation to joy and includes inspirational readings and familiar hymns with audience participation. Anthems included music by Brahms, Lauridsen, Rutter, and the concert premiere of an anthem by Richard J. Clark. Hymns to be sung include "Amazing Grace," "Finlandia" (“This is My Song”), and "America the Beautiful." Readers will be Rosaria Salerno and Liz Walker, transitional preacher of Roxbury Presbyterian Church and former WBZ-TV news anchor. This program seeks to offer solace to Bostonians in the wake of the recent bombings. Tickets are not required, but audience members should arrive early to be ensured a seat.The Copley Singers and Brian Jones participated in the "Healing Our City: An Interfaith Service" on April 18 in the presence of the President and First Lady, and also were invited to represent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the September 2011 commemorations of 9/11 at Ground Zero in New York City. There will be a reception in the Parish Hall following the concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admission: Free-Donations will be gratefully accepted for The One Fund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music starts at 7:30&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to arrive early and post where I'm seating. I'll try for a spot close to the entrance(I have not been to this church), either left hand or right hand side close to the wall)&lt;/p&gt;
