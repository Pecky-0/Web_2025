This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different bar &amp;amp; restaurant scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: India at the end of Blackstone Boulevard on the East Side towards Pawtucket. This week's host is: Suzanne! Thanks Suzanne!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Your welcome Elsbeth.  &lt;br /&gt;India is an East Side favorite and offers a warm and inviting atmosphere, plus free henna tatoos and belly dancing on the weekends! Weather permitting we'll hopefully be outside in their beautiful back garden&amp;nbsp;patio where you can sip cocktails from their swing seats, (alcohol and swing seats.....that will be&amp;nbsp;an interesting mix!)&amp;nbsp;If the weather is not&amp;nbsp;so good&amp;nbsp;we will be near the bar area in the front,&amp;nbsp;where they will also bring us some free apps to sample. They also do $1 apps with each $5 drink purchase. You can see the menu at &lt;a href="http://www.indiarestaurant.com"&gt;www.indiarestaurant.com&lt;/a&gt;. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Suzanne is hosting this one - look at her picture or listen for the Aussie accent!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Suzanne</member_name><member_id>3658033</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305640550000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305252136000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Happy Hour - India!</name><id>18204841</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1305583200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/18204841/</event_url></item>
