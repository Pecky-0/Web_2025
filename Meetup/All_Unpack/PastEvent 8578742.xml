We invite you to visit us at our new location which is opening very soon at 844 Grand Ave. in New Haven and receive these powerful teachings. &lt;br /&gt;Empowerment is a feeling that you have all the resources for strength, creativity and energy within yourself.  It is a knowing that God placed a part of Itself inside you that no one can take away.  When you are critical of yourself you are choosing to focus on concepts that actually drain your power and injure your spirit.  Believing that you are limited prevents you from the full abundance of life that is your birthright.  This seminar will teach you how to recognize your self-critical habits and how  to transform them into  life-affirming  empowerment.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
