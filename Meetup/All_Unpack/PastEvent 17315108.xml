I have on hand "Apples to Apples" "Marry Date or Dump" and some other interesting games.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The house is really nice, and it's a great place to meet new people and talk! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We will be having a potluck so bring something interesting to share! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We will be dancing to some fun music there also. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions or get's lost you can call me at 603-312-6735. I will have some tiki torches at the end of the driveway so just look for them if you get lost.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My parents house is on the intersection of Lundy Lane and Hampshire Ave, it is a long paved driveway. Do not go down the dirt road which is called "Long Pond Road" which is right next to the paved driveway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please park on the side of Hampshire Ave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;See you there.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A small donation would be appreciated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peter &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304119187000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>We all love to meet new people and play games1</why><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302873497000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night Party</name><id>17315108</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304114400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/17315108/</event_url></item>
