<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For LTF day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to set up the fencing and get as much done for Saturday as possible... &lt;br /&gt;We'll need some Gorilla's to help with that and some Gorillaess' to help with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about we meet at 4:00 Friday and see if we can get most of the fence, tables and chairs set up or delivered to the hangars, move planes if possible on the line (Somewhere, need to ask Fred what's open for spots) Or tie down near 20 areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make 4:00, but can 5 or even 6, please let us know when you RSVP your ETA so we can plan work accordingly. We should also be able to figure out how's going to post at what spots on Friday and get emails out to everyone before Saturdays events. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ads are going out as well as stories.... This should be interesting. We'll need everyones continued support and help to make this work out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your help, we're almost there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273886466000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273336045000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>LTF day partial Set Up</name><id>13422867</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273867200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/13422867/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/8/global_14896536.jpeg</photo_url></item>
