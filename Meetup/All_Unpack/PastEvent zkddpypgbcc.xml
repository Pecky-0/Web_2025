<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We'll be meeting at the Seacoast Artists Association in downtown Exeter, NH. There's a large parking lot in the rear of the building, located at 225 Water Street, at the corner of Swazey Parkway. The gallery is on the ground level, accessible from the front or rear of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;We have a challenge for this month's meeting - Water. Between now and the the meeting, take and bring 1-3 photographs which somehow speak to your interpretation of the subject - please feel free to take great liberty with your interpretation of the subject. We'll pass around the photos and see how creative, technical, fun, and skilled we can all be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be shy, we have a very encouraging group of critics and we'll all learn something from the experience. Most of all, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;have fun shooting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown Bag Bingo - Finals!:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;This is the Final Month for Brown Bag Bingo, and we'll be returning bags to their original owners. That leaves everyone one month until the May meeting to get in any missed shots. If you want to find out more, read the rules and track the discussion on our &lt;a href="http://meetup.rumdoodle.com/messages/boards/thread/10040983#38581071" target="_blank"&gt;Brown Bag Bingo Discussion Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring other photos if you'd like feedback or critique, and be prepared to [helpfully] critique others'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything photography- or photographer-related is fair game.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The gallery is in historic downtown Exeter.
