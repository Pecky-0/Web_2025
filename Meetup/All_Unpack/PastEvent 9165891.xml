Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;We are going to do a food drive at this Monday's Happy Hour. As we move closer to the winter season and with the current state of our economy, soup kitchens have an increased need for donations. Please bring nonperishable items to this week's happy hour.  I will have some large bags and boxes to collect the donations and drop off at the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen (DESK) later in the week.  Just taking a few minutes at the store and spending a few dollars -like what you would spend on one drink- will help a lot of people in need out!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is a list of items that DESK is currently in need of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adobo&lt;br /&gt;Canned vegetables&lt;br /&gt;Canned fruit&lt;br /&gt;Peanut butter&lt;br /&gt;Jelly&lt;br /&gt;Sugar&lt;br /&gt;Mayonnaise&lt;br /&gt;Oil&lt;br /&gt;Salt&lt;br /&gt;Pepper&lt;br /&gt;Ketchup&lt;br /&gt;Mustard&lt;br /&gt;Italian salad dressing&lt;br /&gt;Ranch salad dressing&lt;br /&gt;Family-size cream of soups (for casseroles)&lt;br /&gt;Family-size cans of sweet potatoes&lt;br /&gt;Brown sugar&lt;br /&gt;Boxes/bags of stuffing&lt;br /&gt;Butter&lt;br /&gt;BBQ sauce&lt;br /&gt;Crushed red pepper&lt;br /&gt;Parsley&lt;br /&gt;Sage&lt;br /&gt;White vinegar&lt;br /&gt;Chili powder&lt;br /&gt;Garlic powder&lt;br /&gt;Onion powder&lt;br /&gt;Dry mustard&lt;br /&gt;Basil&lt;br /&gt;Oregano&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your support.
