How do you take in information for those three areas differently than the other 5 types?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more about yourself and how others are different and how to communicate more effectively to the other 5 types. Add this tool to others you might know, Enneagram, Myers-Briggs or Astrology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 to 9:30/10pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a sliding scale from $20-40. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $20, it helps the presenter and those who might pay less. No one is turned away because of money, so pay what you can honestly afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcome to bring vegetarian appetizers and drinks, including wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** About Herb Pearce ******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce, M.Ed., has been teaching personality systems for 20 years and has been a psychotherapist for 30 years, having worked with thousands of individuals, couples and families, as well as teams in corporations and agencies.
