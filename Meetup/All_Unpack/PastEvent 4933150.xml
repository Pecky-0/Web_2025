We'll be able to have a more private setting there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring drinks or food for yourselves as this space doesn't have a resturant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chuck from the Boston meetup group will be coming back to give us the results of the survey. We'll discuss the surveys and come up with some ideas for the group show we will be having early next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring any new work you'd like to share and discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to see so many new faces at the last meetup. I look foward to seeing you at the next meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1147393974000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography June Meetup</name><id>4933150</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1149809400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/4933150/</event_url></item>
