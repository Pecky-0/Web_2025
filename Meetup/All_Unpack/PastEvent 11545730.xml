This should be an excellent summit to view foliage. The summit of Owls Head (the north peak of Cherry Mountain), elevation 3,263 feet, provides excellent views of the Presidentials, Crawford Notch, and the peaks surrounding Franconia Notch. Cherry Mountain, consisting of Mount Martha (3573'), Owl's Head (3258').

One is called&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Mountain Slide a about 5-6 miles in along 115 and easily visible from the road and takes you first to Owlâ€™s Head.  We are NOT meeting there.  We are meeting at the first trailhead parking area which is on the right a couple miles up 115 and is set above an embankment and thus difficult to see.  If you reach the Cherry Mountain Slide Trail turn around and head back toward Twin Mountain and look on your left for the hiking trailhead sign on a gravel drive at the embankment and that is Cherry Mountain Trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will have sign NEHM on windshield</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>4KDiane</member_name><member_id>7411900</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255531365000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254692312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Columbus Day Cherry Mtn Hike</name><id>11545730</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255357800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11545730/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/6/global_10646742.jpeg</photo_url></item>
