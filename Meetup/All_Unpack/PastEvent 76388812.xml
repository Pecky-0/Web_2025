<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a few months, but I'm itching to share some Bacon again. Time for the annual Boardgame And Bacon party at the secret lair in the middle of nowhere. For those in the Concord area, I'm involved mostly with the Seacoast gangs, and have only met a few of you. But, I thought I'd post here to pass along, if anyone was looking for something to do on this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All are welcome. Bring a guest if you'd like. It will be a casual all day/all night overnight thing, gaming into the 2nd day, will plenty of chance to play just about anything. The food theme involves tasty meat products, but don't be turned off, we'll have other food yum-yums too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time posting are general. Come when you can. Last year's B&amp;amp;B had us up till the wee hours of the morn, making terrible boardgame decisions. :) Feel free to bring your own games to share. It's in a large home, with a handful of extra sleeping spots and plenty of floor space too. (Bring a sleeping bag just in case, we've even had some campers in the past)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring a simple food dish to pass around and BYOB (Theme is bacon, but doesn't have to be, if that turns you off). We'll be providing some tasty main dishes. Can't wait to see you all!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346181695000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344144087000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boardgame and Bacon Party!</name><id>76388812</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>97200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345914000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/76388812/</event_url></item>
