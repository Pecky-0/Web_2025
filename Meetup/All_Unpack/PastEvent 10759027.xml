It begins to climb by switchbacks toward the ridge top, and the footing improves. A ledge on the left offers a view of Sandwich Mountain, and it crosses a small brook (unreliable). The trail resumes its switchbacks, gains the summit ridge and turns right, and soon reaches the summit ledge, with excellent views. A good outlook to the north can be obtained from a small ledge on a short side path, which begins at the older fire tower site that is located in the woods just to the west of the open ledge. &lt;br /&gt; to Mt Osceola &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals &lt;br /&gt;Distance 3.20 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time 2 hr 41 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2180 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -164 ft &lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +2016 ft &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions&lt;br /&gt;Show in Google Earth&lt;br /&gt;Download to GPS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to here hike 1.00 mi/40 min/-150 ft on the Mount Osceola Trail &lt;br /&gt; The trail then turns left and descends from the summit, alternating flat stretches with steep, rocky descents.
