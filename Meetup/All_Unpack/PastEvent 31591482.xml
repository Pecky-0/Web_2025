Efficient. Hard-working. Moralistic. Straight-laced. Thrifty. No-nonsense. All of these words are common descriptors of the people of Boston. That image of the Boston Brahmins expertly guiding the city to become the Athens of America is an enduring one. But there is another side of the story &amp;ndash; the side of which the Boston Tea Party and the destruction of the Hutchinson House only begin to tell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Did you know that Boston was the most riotous city in the 18&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span&gt;century and third in the total number of riots in the 19&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span&gt;century? This tour will go beyond the Tea Party and destruction of the Hutchinson House to shed light on other lesser-known violent events that shaped not only the history of the city, but the history of America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
