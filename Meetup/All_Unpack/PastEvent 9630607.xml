At The National Institute for the Deaf and Dumb in Paris, the barely clothed and dirty young boy is admitted. Found in a forest living like an animal, the child is unable to speak, communicate or otherwise function normally. Christened Victor by the hospital staff, his case is taken up by Itard, a patient and loving doctor who is also the lone physician who believes he can transform the scarred boy (Jean-Pierre Cargol, in an astonishing debut) from a savage into a reasoning, civilized being. But the road to taming the beast will be a rocky one.&lt;br /&gt;Kendall Description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nearly 40 years after its initial release, Francois Truffaut's &lt;b&gt;The Wild Child&lt;/b&gt; (L'Enfant Sauvage) still manages to cast its haunting, poetic spell.   Washington Post&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truffaut the director's use of black-and-white cinematography and irises suggests an affinity for silent film, and indeed, much of the story's power derives from its imagery rather than dialogue. (That's of necessity, since the story focuses almost entirely on two characters, one of whom cannot speak.) The film's philosophical undercurrent -- is Itard, the man of science, going to have his way with the savage right out of the pages of Rousseau? -- are never pushed too hard, because, as he always does in his best work, Truffaut is more interested in the emotional content of his characters.  All Movie Guide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those keeping score at home, &lt;b&gt;The Wild Child&lt;/b&gt; has the rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoe's Tomatometer.
