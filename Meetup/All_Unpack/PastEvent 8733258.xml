The best part it is free!!  Visit Real Art Ways at www.realartways.org  for more info.  I will be there about 1:10 pm or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SILENT FILM/LIVE MUSIC &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETER PAN (1924)&lt;br /&gt;One of the gems of the (silent) silver screen, this adapation of J. M. Barrie's classic delights children and adults as much now as it did in 1924 (see the period New York Times review linked below, for a description of the 1924 audiences!). Directed by Herbert Brenon, this adaptation makes the Darlings and the Lost Boys come alive before your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are pleased to be able to offer this classic film with live musical accompaniment by THE STUNTMEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCES OF PETER PAN ARE FREE TO THE PUBLIC THANKS TO THE GENEROUS SUPPORT OF THE EVELYN W. PRESTON MEMORIAL TRUST FUND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family Weekends are sponsored in part by the Bank of America, Ensworth Charitable Trust and the Grunberg Family Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture and will hang in the Lounge.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222734693000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221093295000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Silent Movie: Peter Pan w/Musical Accompaniment</name><id>8733258</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222018200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/8733258/</event_url></item>
