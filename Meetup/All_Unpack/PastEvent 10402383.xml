This week the focus will be on creating dating chemistry.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a description from Herb: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You'll learn how to be more attractive - physically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, athletically, aesthetically, etc. to the people you want to attract. You'll be developing yourself at the same time in these areas. Learn how to read body cues, listen for what is attractive and how to encourage people to be attractive to you also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is attraction? That will be explored in depth. Is it something missing in you? Something that you want to develop in yourself? Something that reminds you of someone else? Something that you are &amp;quot;completing&amp;quot; in someone else?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Due to the size of the studio, a RSVP limit has been set. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** About Herb Pearce *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce is a relationship coach of 30 years for couples, singles and families.
