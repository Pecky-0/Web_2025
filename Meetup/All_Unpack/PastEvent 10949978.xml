<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi everyone! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to organize a day trip to Tanglewood on Saturday, August 1st to enjoy some classic music of Debussy, Copland, and Mozart in the beautiful summer evening in the Berkshire (Eastern Mass).     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have not been to Tanglewood, it's a semi-outdoor music venue with lawn area where you can bring food and drinks and have a picnic before and while you enjoy music.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to make this event as a potluck.  Please bring some food either homemade (preferred) or bought at store for you and the others to share.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:  &lt;br /&gt;August 1st, I am planning to leave Boston at 4 p.m. and retuning to Boston around mid-night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: &lt;br /&gt;$30 for a lawn ticket and transportation including gas and toll.  This does not include food and drinks.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transportation:  &lt;br /&gt;We will need other drivers to volunteer to help transport members to and from Tanglewood which is about 2 hours from Boston.  Drivers will be fully compensated for gas (please keep your receipts).  More detailed arrangement will be announced later when I have more information.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passengers will need to do their best to meet at a location convenient for the driver, and this may require passengers to take public transportation to a destination close to the driver. Passengers should also do their very best to be on time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests:  &lt;br /&gt;Because of the limited number of spots available, please e-mail me if you would like to bring a guest. For anyone that wants to bring a guest not affiliated with our group, please remember that you are responsible for your guest's behavior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to bring: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone:  &lt;br /&gt;- A warm fleece, sweatshirt, or blanket (it can occasionally get cold at night)  &lt;br /&gt;- Rain gear (in case of rain) &lt;br /&gt;- Any food or drinks you would like share with the group.   (Please see above about &amp;quot;Potluck&amp;quot;) &lt;br /&gt;Please leave a note about what you would bring to share- Lawn chair, small table, tarp etc. for our picnic &lt;br /&gt;- Sunblock (optional)   &lt;br /&gt;- bug spray (optional)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I am opening up the trip to 12 people, but I will do my best to open it up to more people if there are more interest and additional drivers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shinya</member_name><member_id>4753743</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249428924000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248457502000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Music at Tanglewood</name><id>10949978</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249156800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/10949978/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/7/global_9835063.jpeg</photo_url></item>
