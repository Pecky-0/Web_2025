I've done it in the summer and fall, and the winter is just as beautiful. It is relatively flat with only a few minor challenges. Lots of wildlife and places for the dogs to run (but bring a leash). Park on the side of the road just before or after the sign for the entrance. Depending on the snow depth, bring at least decent boots or snow shoes and dress appropriately for the weather and cold weather exposure (layers and wool or Smartwool socks).&lt;br /&gt;The web site is :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/284_brooks_woodland_preserve.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetrustee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Petersham center (Petersham Country Store is on corner of North Main Street and East), turn onto East street. The entrance is about .8 miles on left. There is, or should be, a sign there. Be sure to go past the North Common Meadow entrance (part of the same area) which is down only about .2 miles on left.&lt;br /&gt;If using MapQuest, or GPS/Nav systems, punch in &amp;quot;85 East Street, Petersham, MA&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hike should take about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;PS: The Petersham Country Store is a great place to visit before or after the hike.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have the gold Subaru Outback and a black lab'.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>7131280</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234622907000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233509360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brooks Woodland Preserve Meetup Hike, Petersham, MA</name><id>9646933</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234116000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/9646933/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/b/global_6770091.jpeg</photo_url></item>
