If we get enough card-carrying patriots together we will be able to cover 3 out of the 4 corners (1 corner does not have a public sidewalk unfortunately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember, park legally in public parking areas (there are PLENTY), do not obstruct pedestrian traffic or vehicular traffic. In my opinion it is OK to engage drivers who are waiting for the light, but not to the extent that you will cause an accident. That is one event which would severely damage our credibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your signage intelligent and to the point. The more creative the better. HONK FOR......signs generate a great deal of feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to everyone from everywhere who is supporting these standouts. I feel they are doing wonders...and we definitely need wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In patriotism,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna R.</member_name><member_id>8973743</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim and Ginny Copeland</member_name><member_id>10195645</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253549266000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252791321000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mini "T" Party @ New Location (Routes 190 &amp; Freshwater Blvd.) @ 12:00 PM </name><id>11356662</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253376000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/11356662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/4/global_10345540.jpeg</photo_url></item>
