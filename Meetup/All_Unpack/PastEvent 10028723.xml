Come join us at the Boston Rock Gym in Woburn to celebrate the arrival of Spring with a healthy and fun workout. It is a great opportunity for you to try rock climbing if you have not yet done so. All levels are welcome. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We have made reservations for our Asian Meetup group for a 2-hour time slot from 3:30 to 5:30pm.  There will be 2 different activities to choose from: rock climbing and bouldering, and you are welcome to try both if you would like.  There will be 1 instructor for every 4 to 5 of us to assist us with securing the cables for climbers (bouldering does not require cables).  Since a private party room is also included in our reservation, please feel free to bring any snacks or non-alcoholic beverages to share with others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since we have to pre-pay for the reservation, an advance payment of $30 per person is required to sign up for this event.  The $30 payment will include the 2-hour use the rock gym for rock climbing or bouldering, gear rental, instructor, the privilege to use the private party room, and the best of all, a chance to hang out with us and to meet new friends!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Payment options&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- paypal or check.&lt;/b&gt; We will email you payment information after you RSVP. Please pay asap after RSVPing. This will ensure that we have enough for the minimum for our group reservations. Space is limited so please pay the fee timely. We appreciate your cooperation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Even though this activity is suitable for anyone who is physically healthy, please consult your physician if you are not sure if it is right for you.
