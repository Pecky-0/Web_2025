<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi, I (Andrew G) will be leading this walk as Greg has other commitments this day.  The walk takes place in Harold Parker's State Forest, a 3000 acre state forest in North Andover a few miles from Route 93.  We will meet in the parking lot of the Forest headquarters - see address and maplink below for directions - at 10:30 am and walk for two hours.  The walk is fairly flat and will take us through forest and around a couple ponds.  The terrain is hiking paths and unpaved (dirt) roads.  See link below for more details on the Forest.  Afterwards, we will drive over for lunch to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee Chen Chinese Cuisine &lt;br /&gt;230 Winthrop Ave&lt;br /&gt;Lawrence, MA 01843 &lt;br /&gt;(thanks Linda and Paul for the recommendation) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to contact me with any questions, including directions.  I suggest checking out the website link for details on the state forest, including trails maps.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to walking with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harold Parker State Forest website link: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/harp.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://mass.gov/dcr/p...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191249204000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188595912000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harold Parker State Forest Walk</name><id>6277100</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191076200000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6277100/</event_url></item>
