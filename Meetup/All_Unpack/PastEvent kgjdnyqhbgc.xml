Although we talk business updates for half an hour and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, telling your own stories, etc. They're so we can all have a little unpressured time as a group. The private back room also has a projector on the ceiling that can be used for evidence clips. As always, Asia has a decent buffet going til 8:00 - $12 per person - or choose something from their most excellent menu. Join us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We usually sit at a table in the back private room.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie Roy</member_name><member_id>4599203</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337869137000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337384989000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>kgjdnyqhbgc</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337812200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/65401982/</event_url></item>
