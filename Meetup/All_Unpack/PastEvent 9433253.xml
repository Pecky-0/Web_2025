The movie is at 7:20. I will be in the theater lobby at 6:50, and we'll head in about 10 minutes before showtime. I will be wearing my red meetup hat. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting at the tables that are at the front of the theater in front of the giant window. If the movie is downstairs, I'll be waiting just behind the ropes across from the concession stand. If you don't catch the group before the movie, no worries, we gather again outside the doors of the room showing the movie. After we go out and have some snacks and a beer. Or two.

[b]Original Introduction[/b]

Yes, this movie could suck. But it was filmed at the Burlington Mall last Summer, and I've eaten lunch in that food court about 10,000 times over my many years working jobs around Rt 128. I have to see it!

Please note, this is not a free screening! And I encourage everyone to buy their tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

In Columbia Pictures' comedy "Paul Blart: Mall Cop," Kevin James stars as the title character, a single, suburban dad, trying to make ends meet as a security officer at a New Jersey mall. Though no one else takes his job seriously, Paul considers himself on the front lines of safety. When a heist shuts down the megaplex, Jersey's most formidable mall cop will have to become a real cop to save the day.
