Accordingly, I would like to divide our very first meeting into two phases:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase I. Theory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose will be to go over what we personally mean by Theoretical Computer Science and invite each member to express his or her interests in each branch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will bring copies of the original papers of Godel 1931 (Incompleteness in Logic) and Turing 1937 (Unsolvability of the Halting Problem giving birth to the Theory of Computation), and Smullyan’s texts.  Either a volunteer or I will go through and present each theorem and its proofs and implications.  For example, does Godel prove that man is superior to machine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d also like to talk about the paradoxes - Liar, Russell’s - including the more recent Metagame and Best Question paradoxes.  The latter has a hilarious and thought-provoking conclusion and is one of my favorite Mathematical stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time permits, we can go over other branches of Computer Science such as Recursion Theory (Kleene’s Program that Outputs Itself, the Fixed Point Theorem, the Recursion Theorem) and Complexity (the P=NP problem.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring your expertise to contribute on the state-of-the-art, as well as your own ground-breaking ideas and real-life examples of paradoxes.  I have an actual bank statement that I received which says “Do not read this statement.”, a catalog of catalogs (does it contain itself?), and a book on books on books!  (Does it contain itself - or perhaps something that does?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase II. Application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floor will be open to questions and problems that participants need to solve.  Members have expressed interest in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The design, analysis and use of Programming Languages in general and Python in particular.  (At least one person in attendance has participated in the development of an ANSI Standard Programming Language.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Topics in Artificial Intelligence including Natural Language Processing and Connectionist Models such as Neural Networks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The use of Mathematics to solve practical problems faced by Software Engineers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see every one of you there with interesting and thought-provoking questions, ideas and discoveries - or just an earnest desire to listen, learn and be fascinated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmest regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the hostess - we will have tables.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlie</member_name><member_id>2078145</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251500568000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Theoreticians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Theoretical-Computer-Science-Problem-Solving</urlname><id>1340773</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Theoretical Computer Science Problem-Solving</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247860920000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>1st.
