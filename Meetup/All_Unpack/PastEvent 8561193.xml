I am currently researching alternative sites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The membership has voted! The September Restaurant of the Month is Cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Restaurant of the Month:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COTTON,  located in Manchester, New Hampshire’s historic Millyard district, is co-owned by Jeffrey Paige, one of New Hampshire’s most celebrated chefs. Jeffrey is co-author of Cooking in the Shaker Spirit, has been featured in numerous publications and on radio and television, and has been the recipient of countless awards and accolades. It might be a surprise to find such a pedigreed chef turning out old-fashioned comfort food, but that is what Jeffrey is doing at Cotton, only with a certain flair and with a helping hand from his wife and business partner, Christine, who runs the front of the house. &lt;br /&gt;A lot of the dishes are familiar comfort foods with a twist or new presentation,” he says. Retro Meatloaf with “All you can eat mashed potatoes” is sauced with a wild mushroom port wine sauce rather than traditional mushroom gravy, and Jeffrey uses Kobe beef for the Bleu Heaven Kobe Beef Burger with applewood smoked bacon, fresh lettuce, hand-cut tomatoes, and homemade pickles. “The meatloaf has never left the menu,” says Jeffrey, “and we make mashed potatoes several times a day in small batches to ensure great potatoes.” As for the burger, Jeffrey believes he was the first to introduce Kobe beef to the southern New Hampshire region when he added it to the menu four years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeffrey has put his creative stamp on a few other classics as well, turning them into menu staples in the process. Fried calamari takes the form of Kung Pao Calamari that are crisply fried and nestled atop an Asian vegetable slaw with ginger soy aioli and spicy peanut vinaigrette. French onion soup is transformed into Baked Onion Apple Cider Soup with fresh thyme and Vermont cheddar cheese gratinee, and spinach salad gets a surprising zip from fresh blueberries, shaved red onion, toasted almonds, crumbled Great Hill bleu cheese, and maple balsamic vinaigrette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to opening Cotton, Jeffrey was the executive chef at Canterbury Shaker Village, in Canterbury, New Hampshire, where a premium was placed on humanely raised and naturally produced meats and seafood, and where much of the produce for the restaurant was grown in the Shaker gardens. Today, Jeffrey adheres to the same standards, using all natural meats, wild caught shellfish, and locally grown organic fruits, vegetables, and herbs whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COTTON has an extensive and always expanding list of carefully selected domestic and imported wines, over 40 by the glass, and an award winning seasonal martini list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tasteoftheseacoast.com/Signature-Dishes/Cotton-Manchester-NH.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tasteofthe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cottonfood.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cottonfood...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Menu:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cottonfood.com/dinner.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cottonfood...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the South: Take I-293 North to Exit 5 (Granite Street Bridge).
