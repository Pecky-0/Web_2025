Fo now the plan ok call it an SOS FUN Mission is to hit Joy Street Sudio CO-OP area first  with over 40 studios first and take is from there. Joy Street Sudio  is Somerville?s vibrant artist community on the other side of the McGrath Highway in the Brickbottom District.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somerville Open Studios (SOS): Visit Somerville's Diverse + Vibrant Arts Community. Over 300 artists in over 100 venues will open their homes and studios for the Tenth Annual Somerville Open Studios Event on Saturday, May 3 and Sunday, May 4 2008 from 12 pm to 6 pm. During this free showcase for the arts, mid-career and emerging artists working across a broad spectrum of fine art styles and craft media ? including painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, glass, fiber, jewelry, furniture and ceramics ? will exhibit their work to the public.&lt;br /&gt;Visitors to SOS will be treated to displays of art in both traditional and non-traditional spaces throughout the city. Come see how Somerville's artists and entrepreneurs have transformed garages, real estate agencies, salons, cocktail lounges, and churches into both impromptu and permanent art galleries.
