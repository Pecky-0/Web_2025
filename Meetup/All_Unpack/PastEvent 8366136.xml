This brand new feature documentary from Italian production company Telemaco explores the latest scientific evidence and reveals dramatic new witness testimony, which directly conflicts with the US Government's account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring presentations from intellectual heavy weights; Gore Vidal, and Noble Prize winner Dario Fo, the film challenges assumptions surrounding the attacks. In the words of the Italian daily newspaper, Il Corriere de da Sera, &amp;quot;What results is a sequence of contradictions, gaps, and omissions of stunning gravity.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The importance of this film can not be overstated. If its thesis is correct, the justification for going to war in Iraq is built on a series of outrageous lies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get this film at &lt;a href="http://zero911movie.com" target="_blank"&gt;zero911movie.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or contact: Zero 9/11 Movie&lt;br /&gt;116 Pleasant Street, Suite 328&lt;br /&gt;Easthampton, MA 01027&lt;br /&gt;tel: 413.282.1000&lt;br /&gt;fax: 413.282.1099&lt;br /&gt;email: info@zero911movie.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the film at 6:00 PM Valley 9/11 Truth will meet to discuss next week's event at the Media Education Foundation space on September 11, 2008.
