<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Thanks to those (9) who showed up for our August discussion, very animated indeed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Location: We're going to try a new restaurant for September 10: Z Square, 14 JFK St. in Harvard Square, downstairs in the corner alcove with the round table. We have it reserved for 2 hours, 7-9 pm, on the understanding that everyone who shows up agrees to spend $10 (or more). I hope that's agreeable to everyone since after all we have to make it worthwhile for the restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: For September, we'll consider the possibilities for naturalistic spirituality. Might Buddhism, for instance, have elements that naturalists would find congenial? Is there a legitmate place for spiritual and religious concerns once we give up the idea of the supernatural?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some readings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thepragmaticbuddhist.com/page2/files/ThePragmaticBuddhistVol1No1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thepragmat...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uuworld.org/life/articles/23523.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.uuworld.or...&lt;/a&gt;  (Rick Heller's article for UU World)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.naturalism.org/spiritua.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.naturalism...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stephenbatchelor.org/msthesiscover.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stephenbat...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there, and please RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189638074000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187049695000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Naturalistic Spirituality? in a new location</name><id>6175318</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189465200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/6175318/</event_url></item>
