To find these buy points we are taking steps to identify who in the group is knowledgeable about specific asset classes, indexes, industry groups or sectors. Doug's Market Talk and Discussion and StockPicks will seek to elicit stocks and ETFs that are at buy points.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We encourage anyone who trades a particular stock or ETF to tell us all, either via posts on BostonIBD (see instructions below if you are not registered for BostonIBD) or via remarks at meetings in the StockPicks segment, or during Doug's Market Talk. Also, we encourage everyone to sign up for the virtual trading (see the link below) so that we can associate people's remarks with performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As regular attendees of our meetings will attest, we prize open discussion. This meeting will have no invited speaker so that we can have an evening of extended discussion about whatever topic you wish to talk about. There will be plenty of time for everyone to get their say and to ask their question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets during the hour from 6:00 PM to 6:50 PM.
