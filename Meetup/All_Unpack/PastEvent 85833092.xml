 &lt;br /&gt;

 SoJust hosts events that draw progressives of all stripes that share common values but may work on different issues. We create social spaces that allow for the possibility of cross-issue connections and run a Skillshare Series, hosted by The NonProfit Center*, which increases our individual capacity for movement building. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Leading With Purpose: Turning Great Ideas Into Reality&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 How many times have you said “I have a great idea..” only to become overwhelmed with how to actually make it happen? This is a chance for inspired leaders, change-makers and individuals to get in the right frame of mind to turn your bright idea into reality and have it succeed. Through interactive, creative exercises you’ll be contemplating, envisioning and sharing your grand plan  with others so you can walk away with a clear sense of what really is possible and what it will take to get your idea going and growing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Socializing for Justice - &lt;a href="http://www.sojust.org"&gt;www.sojust.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With almost 2200 members and almost 6 years of creating a diverse cross-issue community in Boston (135+ events!), Socializing for Justice is the best place to find the great people, organizations and community you're looking for while putting the SOCIAL back in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/strong&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
