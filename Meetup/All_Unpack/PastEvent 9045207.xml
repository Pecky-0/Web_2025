This is a worthwhile cause which I believe deserves as much exposure and support as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the description from the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/calendar/8978117/?success=event_edit_short&amp;amp;eventAction=editing"&gt;BBLD event&lt;/a&gt;.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of reasons I came from New York to Boston is this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been volunteering with the Boston All Stars (www.bostonallstars.org) since I moved from NY.  This is a youth program dedicated to promoting human development through the use of an innovative performance-based model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about the All Stars is that it meets young people where they are, on the streets, and invites them to do what they love to do, &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;span style="color: violet"&gt;perform&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; And then together, we create the opportunity for learning and growth. I love being able to be a part of the lives of young people from poor neighborhoods. Especially, when being a part means being a partner in their development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you'll join me in supporting the Boston All Stars by coming out to an evening of FUN with performances put on by our youth!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of Tri-Chair's of this fundraiser for the Boston All Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boston All Stars Perform!: On the streets where we live&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's a benefit with a silent auction.
