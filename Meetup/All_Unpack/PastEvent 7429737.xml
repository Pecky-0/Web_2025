Christina Congleton will be presenting &amp;quot;Right Rebellion&amp;quot; on Thursday, May 22nd - 7:15 pm.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Generational Spiral and Social Change&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What is the deal with young people these days?  Characterized by the media as both childish narcissists and emerging heroes, it is hard to predict how the social landscape may change as the next generation comes of age.  Integral theory helps us put this puzzle into a broad context, and use historical patterns to make sense of our experience today.  What we discover resolves some of the mystery, and at the same time opens more intriguing questions about the collective future of all generations.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole Trudel Churchill</member_name><member_id>3348175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211671581000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204247795000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Integral Commons - Ken Wilber Meet-Up</name><id>7429737</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211498100000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/7429737/</event_url></item>
