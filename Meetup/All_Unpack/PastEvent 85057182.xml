They hold a weekly trivia event every Wednesday and a group of us will be there this week putting the hurt on our craft rivals who have to gall to think they can beat us! Come join the excitement as we take first place with your help! Or you can just come to hang out and drink some good Irish beer. Either way, registration starts at 8:00, game starts promptly at 8:30.&lt;/p&gt;
