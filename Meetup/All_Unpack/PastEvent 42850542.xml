<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>PLEASE NOTE: THIS EVENT IS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MANCHESTER HOLIDAY PARADE SO OUR VOLUNTEER BASE WILL BE SPREAD VERY THIN. WE COULD USE YOUR HELP. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/144042219032431/" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.facebook....&lt;/a&gt; Description Join us in Portsmouth for outreach at the annual Holiday Parade and Tree Lighting as we partake in the festivities and reach out to potential voters. This is not a time for debate... it's a time to hand out free Ron Paul goodies! We will have some materials on hand, but you are also encouraged to bring your own. Come dressed for the weather. I believe the official event is rain or shine but stay safe if the forecast if for sleet or a blizzard. If you can't find us call me, shem, at 413.230.1245 Here's a link to the official event: &lt;a href="http://www.cityofportsmouth.com/mayor/holiday-parade-2011.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cityofport...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322952394000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1322625977000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Outreach at Portsmouth Holiday Parade</name><id>42850542</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322947800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/42850542/</event_url></item>
