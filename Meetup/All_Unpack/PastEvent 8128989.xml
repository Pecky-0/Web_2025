The meet-up will focus on current animal welfare initiatives and how you can get involved with them.  We'll also talk about the upcoming legislative session and give you an idea on what topics may come up and ways for your voice to be heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to meeting many new animal welfare advocates and hopeful that you'll join me as we form an active community that will benefit animals across Maine.   Please attend!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for signs to the Community Room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221690247000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213276100000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Freeport Animal Welfare Meet-Up</name><id>8128989</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218061800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/8128989/</event_url></item>
