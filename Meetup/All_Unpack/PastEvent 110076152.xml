&lt;p&gt;There is going to be a two hour panel discussion about gun violence, safety, and ownership this coming Thursday, the 21st from 6:30-9pm. Some of the panelists include Holiston Police Chief John Moore as well as ANTI-GUN Democratic Representative David Linsky who recently filed for a bill that would prohibit assault weapons from being stored in homes and requiring applicants to disclose mental health records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A link to the event is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
