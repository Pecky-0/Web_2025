At 2.5 miles, it was the longest private freight-and-passenger railroad in the United States. We will hike along the one-mile portion owned by the Manchester Land Conservation Trust, which will take about 1-1/2 hours round trip. There are no restrooms along the route. Meet at the North End of Main Street in Manchester, behind Farr’s Sporting Goods, 2 Main Street, but park at the nearby shopping plaza (just north of the railroad tracks) or Eighth Utilities office building lot. Free railroad patch for children. Extreme weather cancels. No dogs, please.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Wearing a railroad hat</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>23</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257182287000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249383486000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy walk on the old Cheney Railroad</name><id>11030890</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1257008400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/11030890/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/f/global_10030703.jpeg</photo_url></item>
