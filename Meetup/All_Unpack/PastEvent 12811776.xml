It dates back thousands of years to ancient China. Qi (Chi) is the life force energy that is within and around all of life. We practice simple exercises to allow chi to flow freely through our body. The exercises are designed to open up blockages along the meridians or energy channels of our bodies.  They are simple and easy for all levels. Taoist chanting sounds will be part of the Qi Gong practice. The practice starts in the standing position and we end in sitting meditation. Allowing chi to flow we increase vitality and relaxation. Class will be held from 6-7:15 pm. $15 per class VLC class cards with discount can be applied to this class. Come celebrate spring by feeling good and letting chi flow. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erik  harris</member_name><member_id>10967674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269209503000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268009067000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Qi Gong and Tai Chi class</name><id>12811776</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269036000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/12811776/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/e/global_10735486.jpeg</photo_url></item>
