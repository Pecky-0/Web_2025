&lt;p&gt;RSVP's are limited to 18 due to theater size, so please only say "Yes" if you're pretty sure you can make it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are to attend,&amp;nbsp;I will also need your &lt;em&gt;FULL NAME&lt;/em&gt; for the Concierge to let you in to the building.&amp;nbsp; So please, when you RSVP, either place it in your comment or contact me (AJ) by meetup e-mail or text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event's film is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart People&lt;/strong&gt; (2008 Comedy/Drama)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Descripton:&lt;/span&gt; A widowed pompous college professor at Carnegie Mellon finds he still has a few things to learn about life as he juggles: new health restrictions, his preppy geeky college-bound daughter, his needy adopted brother, attempting to publish a book,&amp;nbsp;carreer challenges, and last but not least being thrown back into the dating mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starring:&amp;nbsp;Dennis Quaid, Sarah Jessica Parker, Thomas Haden Church, and Ellen Page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0858479/"&gt;Here's a link to it's IMDB page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film has a very quirky and ironic&amp;nbsp;sense of humor, and hints at a message along the same lines (though not identical)&amp;nbsp;as 13 Conversations that I showed earlier this year.&amp;nbsp; It is more of an Indie film, thought some mainstream theaters carried it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use the waiting list.&amp;nbsp; As the date aproaches I can&amp;nbsp;add people on the waiting list&amp;nbsp;if someone else backs out, provided you sent&amp;nbsp;me your name for the Concierge as a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Snacks:&lt;/span&gt; Bring your own Snacks and Beverages. (Just please be careful and responsible.) Sharing is encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Getting in:&lt;/span&gt; Enter the building through the State Street Entrance (Between the intersections of State with Court and Chapel) and talk to the Concierge, there are instructions near the call box and a bell button on it if the door is locked. If you really have trouble, pre-movie-start time you can call AJ at 315-345-9348.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Parking:&lt;/span&gt; There is metered street parking available near by on Orange Street and Court Street, pay until 7 pm.&amp;nbsp; If you don't mind a longer walk, some of the Yale Lots are free in the evenings (I.E. Yale lot 51 on Temple Street Starting at 5). 360's Parking Garage is open to visitors for Credit Card Customers only at $5 Daily Max from 5pm on Friday through Sunday, the entrance is on State street just to the right of the buildings main entrance. Other local near by businesses may have open parking, however you're on your own there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don't think I really need to say this, but: This is basically an extension of my home I'm inviting you into, there for I expect everyone will treat it with respect and not risk future events (or my lease).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come to the building door, Ring the Bell Button, Concierge will Direct you.
