We all cast circles and call quarters. But what direction do you use for which element and were you aware there are both invoking and banishing pentagrams? Do you make it facing you or facing out ward? In what quarter is your alter located and when you invoke the elements do you face that quarter or just do it mentally? So we decided to share our ways and means, experiences of why and when we create sacred space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;Blessings &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209423848000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>We always seem to have a good time and enjoy learning about each other.
