This gives everyone an opportunity to come and make new friends, practice their Japanese or English, and enjoy dinner with a bunch of interesting people from around the Boston area (and overseas).  Come on by, relax, practice in either language of your choice, and enjoy being part of our growing community!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, we typically stay in the very back of the Prudential Food Court and should have little signs that say &amp;quot;meetup.com&amp;quot; as table markers (unless I forget them ... which I often do :P ).  Also, if you're interested in getting dinner, most of us go out to eat afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pauline</member_name><member_id>3850672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202940539000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200523172000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Prudential Social Meetup</name><id>7131548</id><headcount>53</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202590800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/7131548/</event_url></item>
