After a delicious meal  we can head over to one of Astoria's great lounges to have drinks and more... If you are up to playing board games or just lounging and having a good time with the girls, here are three great venues that we can pick from at dinner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cafe Bar&lt;/i&gt;  (a lounge with great drinks, DJ, and provides board games.  Is a really relaxed but hip atmosphere as well).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Studio Square&lt;/i&gt; (Astoria's new Beer Garden has a very vibrant atmosphere, indoor and outdoor seating, and occassionally has a band performing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Break Bar &amp;amp; Billiards&lt;/i&gt;  (provides an uncrowded atmosphere with pool and ping pong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please RSVP for the next outing.  We're so looking forward to meeting you all!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;Note: If this meetup becomes full, we will try to make arrangements to accommodate you.
