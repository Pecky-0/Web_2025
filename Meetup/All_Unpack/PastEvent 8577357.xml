For over 160 years, people have traveled to Rockport for our miles of lovely beaches, boulder-strewn paths through woods and glades, and that uncommonly magical light that has inspired painters since Winslow Homer. This family-oriented weekend with an autumn theme is designed to entertain and delight residents and visitors alike. More details to follow as they become available. Pending the weather,we can plan to bring a picnic and meet on one of the small beaches. Parking is limited in Rockport, we might try to organize some carpools. If you are familiar with this area feel free to suggest some ideas and activities.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>TBD</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana S</member_name><member_id>3917923</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>18</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225040408000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
