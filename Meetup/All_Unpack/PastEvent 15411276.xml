Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writers Anonymous Boston is finally breaking out from the underground! It’s been a year since we started our Seven-Word Memoir Book project, a creative process of collecting our life experiences, profound and witty insights captured in seven words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hosting a Seven-Word Memoir Party and Fundraiser to support and promote the publication of our first book, Writers Anonymous Boston: Seven at The Sevens. Hemingway ...said, “All good books have one thing in common – they are truer than if they had really happened.” While writing seven-word memoirs, we let our imaginations get the best of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come get a sneak peek at the book and take a shot at writing your own seven-word memoir to be included in the book! Win great prizes in our raffle and show off your trivia prowess during our literature quiz. Hang out with a group of people who share a passion for writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets/suggested donation is $10-$20 (feel free to donate more if you feel generous). All proceeds go towards self-publication of the book. Snacks will be provided. Space is limited so please reserve early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To buy tickets using Eventbrite, visit: &lt;a href="http://sevenwordmemoir.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://sevenwordmemoi...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;But if you'd prefer Paypal, please follow the Paypal link included here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t miss out on this great opportunity to support your local writers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info about Writers Anonymous, look up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Anonymous-Writers-Wanted/about/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://sevensat7.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/what-is-writers-anonymous-a-prologue-by-kelly/"&gt;http://sevensat7.word...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours Truly,&lt;br /&gt;Brunch &amp;amp; More&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The fundraiser will be set up on the left side of the bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rajjo</member_name><member_id>8334158</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291771453000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289443974000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brought to you by Brunch &amp; More- Writers Anonymous: Seven-Word Memoir Party</name><id>15411276</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291766400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/15411276/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/6/3/global_19541987.jpeg</photo_url></item>
