What is icy cold?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/polls/242696/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to RSVP early as we always fill up quickly. Do RSVP though, especially if it gets you on the waiting list. Usually the waiting list people get to join us for dinner.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to cook on site, unless your recipe takes 45 minutes or more to prepare start to finish. Because the oven opens and closes often baked goods (excepting cookies) are best done ahead of time. Remember this isnâ€™t just a potluck; this is about sharing the pleasure of cooking and food, and learning from one another while drinking wine 'n stuff and having great conversations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring what you'd like to drink plus a little to share.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send the address a few days before the event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281958886000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>31</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278738911000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes Monthly dinner Meetup</name><id>vmbmnynlbrb</id><headcount>32</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281740400000</time><rsvp_limit>36</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/14057805/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/2/global_16310674.jpeg</photo_url></item>
