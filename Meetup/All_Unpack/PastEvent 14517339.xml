The movie - Machete -  will be at the Fresh Pond Cinema at 10PM.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Director Robert Rodriguez thought it would be funny to preface the 2007 Grindhouse double feature with a fake trailer of a gangland-camp style movie called 'Machete'. The audience loved it so much that Rodriguez made into a real movie! It?s too awesome for words, so just watch this trailer: &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/bfBG0n" target="_blank"&gt;http://bit.ly/bfBG0n...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks are meeting up at Jen's place before the movie to mix, mingle, and hear a guest from the RESIST Foundation discuss the immigration justice groups they support.
