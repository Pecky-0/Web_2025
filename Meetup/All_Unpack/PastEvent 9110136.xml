This will be our third year having it at Slattery's. &lt;br /&gt;Festivities start at 6:00 with a cash bar and hor d'oeuvres. &lt;br /&gt;Dinner at 7:00. Includes both entrees Roast Prime Rib and Baked Atlantic Haddock. Along with all the fixins. Dessert and coffees also included.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a night to bring along and introduce your significant other to all of the characters they've been hearing about! Yes, we are for real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for a fun night out with your local flying friends and with (hopefully) a slide show of the year, raffle drawings and a surprise or two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets will be on sale at the November's pilots meeting. Or by e-mailing Charley Valera, Jim Bisson or Russ (Toby) Hume.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, whether you e-mail, call us or send light signal's, make sure you get your clearance (tickets).  We can hold them at the Will Call window with prior payment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's have a Merry Christmas and add to your list lower avfuel costs!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230475435000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226018811000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FPA EAA  Christmas Party</name><id>9110136</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229814000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/9110136/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/9/global_4880393.jpeg</photo_url></item>
