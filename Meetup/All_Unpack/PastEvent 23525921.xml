No visitors are allowed at this meeting because of confidentiality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a member of this meetup group is not the same as being a member of the Innovators Resource Network. Let us know if you have questions regarding this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not too late to email us if you would like to present about your idea or progress report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: it is always a good idea to rsvp "Yes" to meetup events. That way organizers can contact only the people who rsvp'ed with any updates or changes to the event, instead of emailing the whole list.&lt;/p&gt;

Please email or contact us if you wish to take advantage of this - (message Michael or Craig here or email info@irnetwork.org&lt;/p&gt;
