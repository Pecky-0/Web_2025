We do this so each person will have the chance to have their work critiqued...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring only two images. This way everyone gets a chance to have work critiqued by everyone else. Anyone bringing more than two prints will be flogged. It's just not fair to the others. (You know who you are...   )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to bring a snack or a drink to share with the others....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The critique will end at 10 pm sharp, this is a Monday night and we all need to work in the morning! I guess that makes me the crazy time keeper lady... the last two crits - there were a lot of wonderful work and lots of great comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any questions, comments - please let us know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We should be easy to spot...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211411149000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>You'll be heard, and your work will be seen!</why><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209766598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Critique Night!</name><id>7860749</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211238000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/7860749/</event_url></item>
