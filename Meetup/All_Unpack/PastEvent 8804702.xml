Biagio is ordering $150-200 worth of appetizers (Wings/veggie platter, cheeses etc) because their Kitchen is small and we will never get enough food for 200 members. Biagio will ask if you eat any of the appetizers then he will need to ask people please to throw in $5 or so if they have some ( So if you do not have any its still voluntary and a free event).*$5 please*&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cost gets us the whole 2nd floor, 3 bartenders and the DJ so its not all just to cover the food!&lt;br /&gt; I will ask all if you ate or do NOT eat any of the appetizers to please to throw in $5  to help cover the cost of  this event.
