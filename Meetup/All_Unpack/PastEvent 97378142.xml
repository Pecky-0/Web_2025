(link below as soon as I can figure out how to edit and upload the video)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only commit to go if you will attend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy this Groupon but act fast... &lt;a href="http://www.groupon.com/deals/skyventure-new-hampshire-13?utm_campaign=UserReferral&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=uu4440570" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.groupon.com/deals/skyventure-new-hampshire-13?utm_campaign=UserReferral&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=uu4440570&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We will need 12 people.  Do not sign up unless you are certain you will participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate please do not be pregnant, do not have a cast, do not have had a displaced shoulder, weigh under 250 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Once you sign up please send me a message and let me know whether you purchased the Groupon.  This is important as I need that data to know how to book the group and the package pricing does not apply to Groupon holders as those folks already have a discounted deal..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Once we have 12 people signed up I will firm a time and contact each of you; you will need to call SkyVenture and book your time with a credit card.  If you have a Groupon they will not charge your credit card.  The alternative is we have 12 people for a $900 package deal, hence, only state you are going if you are willing to commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Once we have 12 people and a wait list those persons who have not responded to item #2 above may be removed from this list.  Organizing these group events where a certain headcount is necessary can be like herding cats so we really need everyone to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David&lt;/p&gt;
