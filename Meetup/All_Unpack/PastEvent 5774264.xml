Their website is &lt;a href="http://www.sandrasplace.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.sandrasplace.com. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we stuff ourselves with comfort food, we will head to the New Haven Green for a performance by ANGELIQUE KIDJO at 8pm, with GOKH-BI System opening at 7pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A description from the Festival website: &amp;quot;Diva of Afro-pop and Afro-funk, Angelique Kidjo?s voice is an instrument of nature. Her songs and music reflect her experiences growing up on the sea in Benin, her time in France as a young musician, and her current interests in the music of the Americas, including Brazil, Cuba and the Caribbean. Her music joyfully engages a commitment to changing the world through meditations on the sounds of the African diaspora.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To check out more of the Festival, see their website: &lt;a href="http://www.artidea.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.artidea.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.artidea.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1181682097000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179090353000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Soul Food and Afro-Funk Music--An Evening in New Haven</name><id>5774264</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181509200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/5774264/</event_url></item>
