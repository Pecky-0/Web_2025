The Captain's Deck transforms into the best view of the Portsmouth Fireworks in town aboard the M/V Thomas Laighton this July 3rd at 7:00 PM. The best Party Ship in the New Hampshire Seacoast Region just got a whole lot better!&lt;/b&gt; The M/V Thomas Laighton steams through the Piscataqua River and Portsmouth Harbor on this 21 and older party ship. Guests are guaranteed to get a taste of some of the best local music New Hampshire and New England has to offer, a 2 hour cruise of the harbor, and delicious drink specials for all to enjoy on board.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The M/V Thomas Laighton features three cash bars including our open-air Captain's Deck (the top deck) which is ideal for absorbing the sight and sounds of the fireworks, and fresh air that surrounds. DJ Ron Reid will be on the Main Deck spinning all of your favorite party anthems from back in the day to current top 40 hits! Our Party Ships always go rain or shine. Please note: We do not control mother nature as much as we would like to. So if we do not see fireworks or if they are cancelled by the town of Portsmouth, then you will not be refunded. Either way, the cruise will depart as planned.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;After the cruise lets go to the Gaslight Patio or RiRa, for some dancing!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THIS EVENT WILL SELL OUT!!!
