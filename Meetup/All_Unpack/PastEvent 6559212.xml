We will canvass in groups of 2-3 after a brief training and Q&amp;amp;A session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what the campaign has specifically asked us to do. Door to door, face to face campaigning. It is the top priority for the campaign, and they are the experts! PLEASE don't be shy! People in NH expect this and are used to it after all these years of being &amp;quot;first in the nation&amp;quot;. And it can actually be quite fun with the right attitude!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will bring our smiles, our enthusiasm, some literature to hand out, and yard signs (and if people are willing we will set them up in the yard for them!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were already signed up for the Portsmouth Rally, please don't bail out on us. If you need or can offer a ride, please email liz@keyelementdesign.com and I will try to hook you up. LET'S GO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542392000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192545074000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign Wave and Canvassing in Barrington</name><id>6559212</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1193504400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6559212/</event_url></item>
