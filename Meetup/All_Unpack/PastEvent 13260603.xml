Discounted concession items will be available during the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year will mark the Cape Cod League's 46th All-Star Game in its &amp;quot;modern era,&amp;quot; and the 23rd using the present format of East Division versus West Division. Last year's game at Fenway drew 14,317 fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Each summer the Cape Cod League All-Star Game is our premier showcase event,&amp;quot; Cape Cod League president Judy Scarafile said in a statement. &amp;quot;It is eagerly anticipated by everyone connected with the league, especially our players and our many fans. Having it take place at Fenway, America's most beloved ballpark, is only fitting as we celebrate the 126th year of Cape Cod baseball. Last year's event at Fenway, in spite of inclement weather, was a huge success. We are thrilled to be returning.&amp;quot;  &lt;a href="http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100422&amp;amp;content_id=9493420&amp;amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;amp;fext=.jsp&amp;amp;c_id=bos" target="_blank"&gt;FULL STORY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon</member_name><member_id>6918204</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280633394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271961412000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cape Cod League all Star Game - $10/tix</name><id>13260603</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280358000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/13260603/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/a/global_4136986.jpeg</photo_url></item>
