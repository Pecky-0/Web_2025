I will take us down to the beach on back roads. 123 West to 116 South, to 14 West, to 14a, to 49 South. On 49 South we will stop for coffee, snack, bathroom etc.. at The Brown Cow Cafe. We will continue on a scenic ride to Aunt Carries. They have a window where we can get clam cakes and chowder. After George's I will lead you guys out by scenic 1a north. I did this ride yesterday, and it was a little over 100 miles from Hot Leathers. It is a nice ride - very scenic, rural roads. And there is a tunnel on 14 west, but no-one will need a ticket because you won't be coming out the other the end.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cindy</member_name><member_id>1336272</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sue C.</member_name><member_id>10116056</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280754086000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>women bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandthunder</urlname><id>1487157</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9599990845</group_lon><name>New England Thunder / South Shore, MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277128437000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ticket to Ride</name><id>13862648</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279972800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandthunder/events/13862648/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/0/c/global_15509132.jpeg</photo_url></item>
