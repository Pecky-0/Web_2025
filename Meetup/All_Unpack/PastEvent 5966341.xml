I hope some folks managed to see David Lindahl in Dedham. We'd like to hear your impressions. I have been processing a &amp;quot;Short Sale&amp;quot; this past month with a great deal of help form my friend Derek Ebrecht. I will speak about it and answer any ?s that come up. I dont' expect it to be a very high attendance, so you may get a chance to bring up a ? or 2 that you need answered. I'll see you there. dale&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dale</member_name><member_id>3116571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186614384000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183420883000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club August Meetup</name><id>5966341</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186441200000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/5966341/</event_url></item>
