<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is an almost purely social event...a chance to get together over chips, salsa, and some Mexican food and get to know one another, swap stories, and help each other with issues that might exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll kick off the meetup at six, and it'll roll, based on past experience, for a couple of hours.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tortilla Flats is a nice place, situated at the corner of Hope and Olney Streets, cat-cornered to Hope High School, on Providence's East Side.  It's close to I-95, and on-street parking is plentiful.  The food is fairly good and relatively inexpensive.  And, the place, while not a library, is reasonably low-key enough for conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're trying a Monday night this time based on feedback from members.  Hope this works better for everyone....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Daquiri in my hand:)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240448110000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Organizers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NEOrganizers</urlname><id>321127</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>New England Meetup Organizers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233979816000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New England Organizers' Providence Chapter - March Social</name><id>9691580</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236639600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NEOrganizers/events/9691580/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/0/3/global_4756611.jpeg</photo_url></item>
