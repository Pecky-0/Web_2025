Yes, the NHC will once again be fielding a CO-ED team this year, hopefully, in the New Haven league, (we played in the East Haven league last year, and none of us want any part of that again!)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This impromptu practice will also serve as an (unorganized) informational meeting to deal with the who, what, where, when, why, and how to this year's team(s).  We'll talk roster, money, schedules, etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a note to newcomers, or anyone who didn't play last year, the team's official roster is not set, but those who played last year and helped at practices get first crack at positions.  Should we get a lot of interest, there is always the possibility of fielding two teams.  All that being said, ALL are always welcome at our practices, we always need the extra bodies to scrimmage with, as well as extra equipment, and/or drinks for the team.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while those wimpy major leaguers are practicing in 80+ degree weather down in Florida, we'll tough it out in the balmy 45 degrees this Saturday.   Wear some fleece, you'll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, rain will obviously cancel this, so look out your window Saturday morning.  Or you can call either of your contacts on their cells:  Richard @ 203-520-6377, or Chris @ 203-525-5670&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The field is at the back of the parking lot behind the rink.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Year, New League, New Attitude.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173720979000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173385153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play Ball!
