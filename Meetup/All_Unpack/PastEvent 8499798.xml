This group sponsors ski/snowboard races, social events, lift ticket and vendor discounts and many other perks for its member clubs.  This event, at Tia's in Boston, will give you the opportunity to meet Wedeln members and members of many other clubs.  This is a great way to learn about the fabulous and friendly clubs that make up the EICSL family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tia's is a popular after-work bar on the waterfront not far from Quincy Market. We will have a semi-private section of Tia's. This is a free, buy your own drinks type of event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information please check out the flyer at &lt;a href="http://skiing.meetup.com/81/files/"&gt;http://skiing.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;   For directions and bar info check out &lt;a href="http://www.tiaswaterfront.com/"&gt;http://www.tiaswaterf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be there so please look for me and introduce yourself if you are attending your first event.
