&lt;p&gt;This is always guaranteed to be fun. Music last month ranged from Tainted Love to the Cars to Dance with Somebody (whitney houston). Although Local 121 has a DJ every night, Pete only spins on the first friday starting at 11pm until the lights go on at 1:40. There is no cover charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd has an ebb and flow, and the tiny psuedo-dance floor in the corner does get tight. But, that makes it fun although be prepared to deal with getting bumped (just bein' honest). Some of us will be having dinner earlier down the street. So start congregating around 10 probably. The staff will remove the bar stools before 11 and we could plant ourselves near one of the cocktail tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at our pictures and don't be shy to introduce yourself. Bring friends!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333829249000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331250906000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Handsome Pete's 80s Night</name><id>55574022</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333764000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/55574022/</event_url></item>
