Park includes picnic sites, walking trails and scenic vistas of Boston's skyline and mountains in the west. Most of the trail is an up hill climb. It's a former downhill ski park. There is a stream by the parking lot, scenic vistas of Boston and the Waltham reservoir, pine forests, erratic boulders and ponds. The view from the top should be great, as we can see the fall foliage encroach on the reservoir. Weather looks to be a crisp fall day. The address is 314 Totten Pond Rd. in Waltham MA. If you are heading east the parking lot is on the right. It is on the first curve after 128/95. The entrance to the park is on a curve that banks to the right before an ice skating rink which is on the left side of the road. This road can move fast so be careful not to overshoot the entrance.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary</member_name><member_id>10901006</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319386780000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Subnats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>science-88</urlname><id>1005141</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Suburban Naturalists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319129950000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike Prospect Hill and look at how nature has taken back the ski slope.</name><id>38103582</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319382000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/science-88/events/38103582/</event_url></item>
