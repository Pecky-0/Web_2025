I was never able to attend the past meetups because Northwood was just too far away for me (although Susty's is great...I have been once). I'd really like to meet vegans in and around Manchester, so let's get together and brainstorm some places/times to meet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cafe Momo is a great Nepalese restaurant off exit 6 of 93. It is not all vegetarian, but there are vegan options, and the staff is very knowledgable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please attend if you'd like to help give this meetup group a bit of a new look!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I don't know what I will be wearing yet, but I am a 23 year old female (Nicole, by the way), about 5'7", chin-length brown hair, and will probably be with my 6'2" boyfriend, Ryan (he's hard to miss).</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole</member_name><member_id>5711747</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222626202000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Join us to meet new people and try new restaurants and vegan food.</why><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212426033000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A real MANCHESTER vegan meetup!</name><id>8061621</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213916400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/8061621/</event_url></item>
