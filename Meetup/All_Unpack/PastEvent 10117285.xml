I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibit Information:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For My Best Beloved Sister Mia: An Album of Photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron&lt;br /&gt;July 4, 2009 - September 7, 2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During her lifetime, Julia Margaret Cameron (1815–1879) was recognized as one of the leading photographers of her era and today is regarded as one of finest portraitists of the medium. This album, made for her sister Maria Jackson (affectionately known as Mia) includes family portraits and allegorical works, such as her famous series on Mia’s daughter, who later became the mother of the writer Virginia Woolf. In addition, the album features images of some of the most celebrated figures of Victorian England—among them the poet Alfred Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelite painter George Frederic Watts. In addition, Cameron collected work by her colleagues including O. G. Rejlander one of the first to promote photography as an art form and Lewis Carroll, the author of  Alice in Wonderland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The traveling exhibition of this privately owned and rarely seen photographic album is organized by Art 2 Art Circulating Exhibitions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet right outside the entrance at 6pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>8243578</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247957833000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Out &amp; Abouters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Out-and-About-Group</urlname><id>1365436</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Out and About Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238897526000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Museum of Art</name><id>10117285</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247263200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Out-and-About-Group/events/10117285/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/b/global_7133307.jpeg</photo_url></item>
