The towpath is 4.5 miles long, but we probably won't go that far since we have to turn around and retrace our steps back to the parking lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there from I-91, take Route 190 west.  Turn left (south) on Route 159 and take the first left (only .1 mile) onto Canal Road.  At the end of Canal Road there is a state maintained parking lot and the northern end of the path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who's interested in a bite to eat afterwards, we have our choice of several restaurants back across the river in Enfield.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185141769000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184815474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stroll along the Windsor Locks Canal</name><id>6045405</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184968800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/6045405/</event_url></item>
