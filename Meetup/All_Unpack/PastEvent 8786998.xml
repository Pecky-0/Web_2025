Don and Sharon will be our hosts and they are famous for their Halloween parties!  So get to work on your costume and plan to meet us there.  To give everyone a chance to greet their own trick-or-treaters, we won't start until 8:30-ish.  BYOB and a snack or dessert to share.  If you want to crash for the night, bring a sleeping bag and any other necessary supplies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the event is in a private home, you must RSVP to get directions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225672440000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221783017000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Halloween Party</name><id>8786998</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225499400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/8786998/</event_url></item>
