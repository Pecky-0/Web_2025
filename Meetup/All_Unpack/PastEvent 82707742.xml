Please plan to arrive at least 10 minutes early as we'll have someone letting people into the building before the workshops start. Workshops will be starting each Monday promptly at 6:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this 3-teacher hoop dance workshop series, we will offer both basics of on &amp;amp; off body hooping and for intermediate/advanced hoopers a chance to build a more dynamic bond between you and the hoop. Our goal with the 5-week series is to give all participants a fun way to get fit while also building their vocabulary of tricks and transitions to facilitate flow. All levels of experience are welcome, no experience necessary. Hoops WILL be provided for the workshop/jam and will be available for purchase or custom order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 hr workshop $15 &lt;br /&gt;

1 hr jam only $10 &lt;br /&gt;

2hr workshop+jam $20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$60 workshop series &lt;br /&gt;

$85 series with jams&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348537191000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347844781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spiral In: Hooping the Pattern</name><id>82707742</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348525800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/82707742/</event_url></item>
