This part may be a little wet as we have to cross below the dam where the trail crosses the spillway. Then we hike up the steep side of the ridge and climb only about an easy 10 feet or so of traprock. The path to climb is very easy with lots of secure places for feet and hands and can barely be called climbing. The reward is great though as at the top on Chauncey Peak is a WONDERFUL vista!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail follows the cliff edge to the north with a great view of the lake below and Lamintation Mtn. on the other side of the lake. Eventually, as we get past the lake, the trail will cut down steeply from the ridge line. There is no climbing, but you need to watch your step lest you slip on leaves or scree and slide a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then travel a little up the side of Lamintation Mtn. before cutting back to the lake. The path continues down by the side of the lake and finishes with a pleasent walk through the old evergreens at lakeside to get back to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll roughly estimate this hike to be a beautiful 1.75 hrs. No food trip for this hike due to the tight timing with my going to work after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;)  is leading on this one so please direct questions to him. His cell number is (860) 836-3400.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximate location and directions to the park entrance can be found via MapQuest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;latitude=&amp;amp;longitude=&amp;amp;name=&amp;amp;phone=&amp;amp;level=&amp;amp;addtohistory=&amp;amp;cat=&amp;amp;address=800+westfield+rd.&amp;amp;city=meriden&amp;amp;state=ct&amp;amp;zipcode="&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from the Hartford area:&lt;br /&gt;* Take I-91 S&lt;br /&gt;* Take the MIDDLE ST. exit- EXIT 20- toward COUNTRY CLUB RD. (go .2 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* Turn LEFT onto MIDDLE ST. (go &amp;lt;.1 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* Turn RIGHT onto COUNTRY CLUB RD. (go 1.6 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* COUNTRY CLUB RD. becomes WESTFIELD RD. (go roughly .6 mi.)&lt;br /&gt;* The entrance  to Giuffrida Park will be on your right. [***NOTE: Going in this direction (south) it is the FIRST right after the quarry facility. Park entrance NOT marked!!! Looks like a street with no street sign.***]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good map for a portion of the hike can be found in Map #20, Mattabesett Trail Map #6 in the Connecticut Walk Book published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. The link provided here takes you to a topographic map of the area centered on Chauncey Peak. A number of maps (this topo link included) list the lake as being named Bradley Hubbard Reservoir. You can zoom out on the map by changing the View Scale on the left to 1:50,000 or a little higher to get a context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a general topographical map, see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=18&amp;amp;n=4603131&amp;amp;e=686860&amp;amp;s=25&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;datum=nad83&amp;amp;layer=DRG25"&gt;http://www.topozone.c...&lt;/a&gt;[/url]&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187053628000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185850453000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at Giuffrida Park &amp; Chauncey Peak in Meriden CT</name><id>6101693</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186232400000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/6101693/</event_url></item>
