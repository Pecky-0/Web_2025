Please bring your favorite vegan Thanksgiving dish to share with others, along with the recipe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will scan all of the recipes at the end of the potluck and e-mail them to the NH/VT Vegan Meetup group for inspiration in planning your own cruelty-free Thanksgiving dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also hoping that we can have a lively discussion about how to (politely) deal with the inevitable sticky situations that arise when enjoying a Thanksgiving meal with omnivorous family members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I will be taking donations from anyone who wants to help the NH/VT Vegan Meetup Group adopt a turkey through Farm Sanctuary.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a sign that says "Vegan Thanksgiving!"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lola</member_name><member_id>915277</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259005609000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pioneers of Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-430</urlname><id>650201</id><group_lat>43.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2699966431</group_lon><name>NH/VT Vegan Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257628385000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vegan Pre-Thanksgiving Feast and Recipe Exchange</name><id>11820892</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258831800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-430/events/11820892/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/global_1994793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
