<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The former Moseley family estate on the Merrimack River, this park features 19th century gardens and plantings, rolling meadows, towering pines, and one of the largest naturally-occurring stands of mountain laurel in Massachusetts. Most breathtaking are the ornamental trees and masses of azaleas and rhododendrons that bloom in May and June. An exquisite place for walking, biking, horseback riding and informal picnics. Special Use Permits may be obtained for wedding ceremonies and similar programs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a ride please say so in your rsvp, saying which area you are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the parking area at 10:30.
