There is always something to talk about being German/Swiss/Austrian in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We expressively welcome anybody who lived for a while in a German speaking country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not forget to RSVP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaj&lt;br /&gt;Your humble organizer&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Jacob Wirth is a German Restaurant in the theater district of Boston, that serves German favorites such as Bratwurst and Sauerkraut or Wiener Schnitzel. They also have Paulaner Hefeweizen and other German beer.&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S.: There is parking right next to the restaurant, which is $15 (the deposit is NOT REFUNDED ANY MORE). If you like a walk in the Park, you can take advantage of the night special at the Boston Common parking for $10 flat.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm usually the guy in a red Meetup T-Shirt.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaj Kandler</member_name><member_id>1142521</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elisabeth</member_name><member_id>2046527</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272500204000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>German expatriates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-expatriates-in-boston</urlname><id>57664</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>German Expatriates in Boston  Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270680260000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>German Expatriates in Boston  Meetup Monthly Meetup</name><id>fbcdnyngblc</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272495600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-expatriates-in-boston/events/13118488/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/2/global_317410.jpeg</photo_url></item>
