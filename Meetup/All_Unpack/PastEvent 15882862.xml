January is &amp;quot;Fire and Ice&amp;quot; so they are showing &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216487/" target="_blank"&gt;The Girl Who Played with Fire &lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from 2009.  It runs 129 minutes and is in Swedish with subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission to the movies is included in your admission to &amp;quot;First Thursday.&amp;quot;  I try to come to each film but sometimes work late, so don't let that stop you.  Other meetup groups also attend and you might join one of them if you don't find other movie meetup people.  I've cross-posted this on the Hartford Movie Meetup so you will see two notices if you're a member of both groups.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294439616000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293968046000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"The Girl Who Played Wth Fire" @ First Thursday</name><id>15882862</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294361100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/15882862/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
