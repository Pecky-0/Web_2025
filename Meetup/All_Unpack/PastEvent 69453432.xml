We'll provide everything you need and it's totally free! We'll show up and climb for a while, then have a BBQ in the park. You don't need any outdoor climbing experience to come check things out and we promise, the bunnies will take good care of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have your own gear and know what you're doing, we'd love for you to join us, but please mark yourself as NOT attending and say in the comments that you are attending and what gear you'll be bringing. We need to limit the number of inexperienced climbers to how many we can handle belaying/gear for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be updating this post with more info as we get closer to the date but I wanted to get it on here so people could start planning to be around for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Loter</member_name><member_id>2298440</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341199502000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctrockclimbing</urlname><id>1388805</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>CT Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339869375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climb Outside at Chatfield!</name><id>69453432</id><headcount>15</headcount><duration>14400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341064800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ctrockclimbing/events/69453432/</event_url></item>
