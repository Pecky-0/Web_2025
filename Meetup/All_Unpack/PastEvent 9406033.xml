Ruppert is the former Los Angeles drug enforcement detective who discovered the CIA connection to drug-running in LA and exposed it to the PD, the Congress, and the world. He has since formed the &lt;a href="http://fromthewilderness.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;From The Wilderness web site&lt;/a&gt; and research operation. He very early on revealed, in his articles and videos, the connections between the drug business, the financial/banking interests and the war machine's intent to start another oil/resource/drug war in Afganistan/Middle East. Given the difficulty of pursuing this course, Mike has had some difficulties, but is now getting back into action and the From the Wilderness operation is back and running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Having concluded that the US government and markets will be useless&lt;/b&gt; in preparing American citizens for the coming crisis, Mike's current focus is on individual and community preparedness for the coming challenges and the development of a reliable news service to quickly identify and track breaking developments around the world. These are in consonance with what a lot of New-Hampshire folks have seen as their interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short Subjects:&lt;/b&gt; We may also have time for some shorts, including the latest version of a local filmmakers developing work: &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;9-11 Cinema Before The Fact.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; Be sure to bring your favorite shorts and bring blank DVDs if you'd like copies of anything from our library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: 1st Tuesday-Nashua; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; &lt;b&gt;3rd Tuesday-Concord&lt;/b&gt;; 4th Tuesday- Bristol (our new northern location). If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, maybe we'll have a Truth Party somewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at 6:30&lt;/b&gt; if you can, in order to help set up the healthy snacks and beverages (that you bring to share with others) and enjoy the pre-meeting networking. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and then on to the video showing right after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newspaper&lt;/b&gt; - For an interesting paper which covers 9/11 Truth issues and other topics of concern, visit the &lt;a href="http://rockcreekfreepress.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rock Creek Free Press&lt;/a&gt; out of Washington, D.C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have set up a &lt;a href="http://mv911t.erideshare.com" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;carpooling group&amp;quot; online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at eRideShare.com.
