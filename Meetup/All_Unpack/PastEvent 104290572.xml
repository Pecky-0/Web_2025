<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We'll check in with each other and hear about problems and triumphs. Please come with at least one really bothersome current problem (the more absurd it sounds, the better!) and at least one triumph (it can be in the past if there are no current triumphs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we check in and hear about problems and triumphs, we can discuss recent reading material, links, or questions. We can also discuss any actions we have taken after hearing our speaker at the last meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be hoping to find, and encourage others to find, accountability buddies. Buddies can be a really effective element in achieving progress with both procrastination and clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please come early if you want to have something to eat or drink. At least one of us will be there so you won't be lonesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have a sign saying MWPC.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alice</member_name><member_id>7648322</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362199464000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Procrastinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Metrowest-Procrastinators-and-Clutterers</urlname><id>1357989</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>Metrowest Procrastinators and Clutterers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360696863000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Attend a Round Table on Procrastination and Clutter</name><id>104290572</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362096000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Metrowest-Procrastinators-and-Clutterers/events/104290572/</event_url></item>
