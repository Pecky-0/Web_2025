&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would anyone like to join me at Trader Jan's for some shooting?&amp;nbsp; Don't worry if you're don't know anything about archery - you won't be far behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need any equipment - it's all included for $15/hr (I only intend to shoot for one hour).&amp;nbsp; It's a little tricky finding the entrance to Trader Jan's - the door is actually in the back of the building, and you'll have to take the elevator to the second floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not making reservations, so I'm keeping the RSVP limit VERY small and disallowing guests.&amp;nbsp; Please do not sign up unless you *REALLY* think you're going to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE REMEMBER to ask for arm guards when you get there.&amp;nbsp; They prevent painful bruises that some new shooters will get in their arms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the guy with really short hair, or try my cell: 401-699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306521213000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1306106700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Archery for n00bs!</name><id>19323611</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306449000000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/19323611/</event_url></item>
