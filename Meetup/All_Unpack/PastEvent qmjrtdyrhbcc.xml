&lt;p&gt;Ideas from members:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a copy of an Arabic collection of modern short stories published in the UK (?A Reader of Modern Arabic Short Stories?, edited by Sabry Hafez and Catherine Cobham, 1988). I know there are at least a couple other such collections. I would love to be able to study selections from such a resource and meet to discuss the use of Arabic in the story (especially idiomatic uses) and how the language can be understood by an English speaker. Perhaps members of this group who may have connections in Arabic speaking countries could provide sources to obtain copies of contemporary Arabic literature which could be used as material for our group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for books in Arabic!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alaina</member_name><member_id>12777577</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily Sumner</member_name><member_id>59055492</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1369191806000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Arabic Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonArabic</urlname><id>1143990</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Area Arabic Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1352676094000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arabic Literature Study</name><id>qmjrtdyrhbcc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1369180800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonArabic/events/119280472/</event_url></item>
