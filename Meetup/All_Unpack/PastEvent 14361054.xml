A different routine will be taught each week. Music will vary anywhere from Janet Jackson to Missy Elliot but feel free to bring in any music you would like. This class will build and strengthen lean muscle, increase flexibility, and shed calories. Each class will start with an intense stretching warm up that incorporates some pilates. At the end of the class we will work towards developing a &amp;quot;six pack&amp;quot; with a 10 minute abdominal work out. But, in between it's just dance, dance, dance.......So take some &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; time and sign up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hour long class is $10 or you can get a ten pack for $90 (you can mix and match with Strip Fit and Bridget's bootcamp class)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In the waiting room, if it's your first time here please try to arrive 5-10 minutes early.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christie</member_name><member_id>11635611</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282267634000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281316087000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hip Hop</name><id>14361054</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282253400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/14361054/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/e/global_9140398.jpeg</photo_url></item>
