It's become quite popular. And it's always a good time! They also have their regular weekly entertainment, "The Athenian Ensemble" along with belly dancing later in the evening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you like Greek food? Have you always wanted to try it? It's absolutely deicious! The atmosphere at the restuarant is close to family-style. I've hosted events at this venue, and it's always been a great time! Check out the menu @: www.atheniancorner.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Music outside begins at 7 pm &lt;br /&gt;

Music inside starts at 8pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* THE CONCERT IS FREE. However, being a restaurant and bar, it's expected that you purchase drinks, appetizers, a meal or all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will NOT be making a reservation. If we are seated outside, depending on the number of RSVP we may need several tables. If we are inside, we definitely should all be able to be seated together. Please be advised that which ever way this goes, there may be a short wait for any table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Parking: The restaurant has a small side lot. Otherwise, parking would be on the street or public garage. My contact # is: 978.289.7679 after 6:00 pm.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347597895000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley</urlname><id>1116818</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Meeting &amp; Greeting in So.
