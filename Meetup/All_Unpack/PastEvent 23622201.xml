I know I am! Lets fix that by meeting for some after work beach time! I'll bring my bocce ball set, I have someone else bringing Kan Jam ( a fun game involving throwing and hitting a&amp;nbsp;Frisbee&amp;nbsp;into a plastic barrel) and people are free to bring whatever else they want. We can probably get a couple good hours in....if it works out I'll schedule it more often. Note: Parking is free after 3:30!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet on the wooden boardwalk near the showers/food stand area</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309525209000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309138563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beach Games!</name><id>23622201</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309469400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/23622201/</event_url></item>
