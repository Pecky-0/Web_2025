This is the fifth hike in the Five-Park Hiking Challenge. &lt;br /&gt;

Join Amy Wilmot, a DCR interpreter and myself on a moderate 5 mile hike in Borderland State Park in Easton. This park, almost 1800 acres in size, is heavily wooded in some areas, but also offers a number of scenic ponds and open field areas and a former granite quarry. It is the former estate of the prominent Ames family who built a twenty room mansion where the family lived for over sixty years, before it was acquired by the state and opened as a park in 1971. Borderland is also a very popular bird watching area and wildlife haven because of the diverse habitat and other nearby conservation areas.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will explore a good cross section of the park, including the grounds of the mansion, Leach and Upper Leach ponds and an area with interesting geological features and a boardwalk through a swamp. We will also share some interesting information and discuss unique features that this park has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
