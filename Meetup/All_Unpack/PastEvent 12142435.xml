If you would like to set up and lead paddles in eastern CT, or RI, please let me know. We can use additional paddle leaders. You do not need to be a great paddler to lead a paddle. You do need to be a decent social organizer. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Plan scheduled paddles from April to July, at least. We will plan with multiple skill level paddles in mind: at least beginners and moderate skills. As such, all paddles will be considered flat water, although several may be in the ocean (harbors and estuaries, not open ocean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have inputs or suggestions, and cannot make the meeting, be sure to send them to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we have not met yet, look for the meetup sign on my table. Check the meetup site to see the size of the group before you go so you know if you are looking for a room full of people or just a small table.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268060803000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SNEP-1</urlname><id>1360815</id><group_lat>41.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.1100006104</group_lon><name>Southern New England Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261670029000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring Planning Meeting</name><id>12142435</id><headcount>753</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267887600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SNEP-1/events/12142435/</event_url></item>
