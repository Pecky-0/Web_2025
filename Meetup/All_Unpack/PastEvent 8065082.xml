If you are coming in from outside the city, I recommend parking a bit farther out and taking the Green Line B, C, or D routes to the Hynes Convention &lt;br /&gt;Center stop, that's just half a block from the Trident. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.tridentbookscafe.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tridentbookscafe.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tridentboo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we may well change over to a location that offers far better immediate parking opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;Davis Square in Somerville is a real possibility.  The Diesel Cafe there has a large back room&lt;br /&gt;that we might be able to use.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be located at the front dining area of the Trident, with a small "Graphic Design"

Learn something, share experiences 
with others in the trenches.   Network!  See what jobs may be opening up.  Have some fun!
Maybe we can get some guest presenters.</why><group><who>Graphic Designers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>graphicdesign-39</urlname><id>71144</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Graphic Design Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212453441000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Graphic Design July Meeting</name><id>8065082</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216078200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/graphicdesign-39/events/8065082/</event_url></item>
