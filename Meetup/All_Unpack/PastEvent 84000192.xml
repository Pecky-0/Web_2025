He has toured with Grammy Award winning band Jars of Clay, opening for, as well as playing percussion with the band and has also played with songwriter luminaries Arlo Guthrie, Phil Keaggy, David Wilcox, Patty Larkin and Ellis Paul. With the release of his new CD, ‘Stone Water Wood Light’ Williams departs from his singer songwriter sound to incorporate more elements of swampy soul and blues, with new songs that cover issues ranging from the lack of honesty among leaders and media, to the religious subculture of the South, to his own questioning and desire to be more a socially conscious individual. And all written through new eyes as Williams and his wife of seven years welcomed their first child into this world. “No one heard these new songs more than my son,” Williams states, “he is fascinated by the guitar and when you find something that calms the baby, you stick with it...so I worked on most of these songs when I was hanging with my newborn.” Being a new father has certainly changed his perspective and now Williams brings even more heart to his smart, honest writing and engaging performances and storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350180741000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348583186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Christopher Williams in Concert - Not to be MISSED</name><id>84000192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350169200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/84000192/</event_url></item>
