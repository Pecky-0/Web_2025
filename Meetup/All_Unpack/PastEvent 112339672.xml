We'll meet with local author Phoebe Baker Hyde and discuss her new book, &lt;em&gt;The Beauty Experiment: How I Skipped Lipstick, Ditched Fashion, Faced the World without Concealer, and Learned to Love the Real Me.&lt;/em&gt; The book has been stirring up some controversy and media interest and has been featured by The New York Post, Yahoo, The Boston Globe and Katie Couric. Phoebe will give a short talk, moderate the discussion, and answer questions. Should be a fun and enlightening evening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a description of the book by an Amazon reviewer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baker-Hyde's book is lovely to read, self-reflective and perceptive. She offers a model of feminism that is not self-consciously so, but is rather a search for self, with awareness of how femininity is sold to women in the guise of products and habits that can become all-engulfing and inspire purposeless, unachievable perfectionism. She makes a bolder move than many explicitly feminist commentators on the beauty industry have done, throwing away her beauty products and claiming her time to write rather than primp. Her proposal -- that we figure use our beauty products only when they are a joyful, optional enhancement rather than a burdensome requirement -- is not novel. But she gets the reader to that idea in a series of personal, persuasive essays about her own experience getting to that point, and it is a pleasure to follow her on her journey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
