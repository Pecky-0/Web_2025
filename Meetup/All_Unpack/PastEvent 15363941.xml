Lets get a group together to check out the opening night of the Boston Snowsports expo this Thursday.  We will meet outside the main entrance at 6pm.  At 6:15pm we will head in as a group and check out all the cool booths and merchandise. Hopefully we can get some decent discounts and special deals.  Several Mountains will offer deals on accommodations, lift tickets, coupons and more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year Eastern Border will replace lame Ski Market as one of the main resellers so look for lots more snowboard gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably take the subway over from Harvard Sq so let me know if you want to meet at 5:15 and ride the redline over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bewisports.com/expos/boston/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bewisports...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a coupon on this website that will save you $2, although the cost to enter is only $12.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the show we will hit The Stadium in South Boston for an after party and ski movies, I will add this as a separate meetup.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be at main entrance - Will have a blue and yellow jacket (HS varsity jacket style) eith "Wedeln Ski Club" logo on front and back.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289631978000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289088706000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Snowsports Expo in Boston</name><id>15363941</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289518200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/15363941/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/1/global_19424641.jpeg</photo_url></item>
