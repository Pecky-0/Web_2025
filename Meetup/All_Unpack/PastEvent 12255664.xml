So here's a chance for some of us to get together for a few hours of hands-on crafting at ArtStudio 360 in Holliston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using the time to work on cards for February swaps -- or the postponed January swaps, if you missed them -- or the March swaps if you're working waaaaaaaay ahead. But, really, you're welcome bring and work on any projects you like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrive anytime after 1 p.m. We'll go 'til about 6 p.m. We offer free parking, table space, a kitchenette, restrooms, spring water and shared supplies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usual Open Studio fee is $5 per person, but if you can throw in a bit more to help defray the group's costs, that would be great. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263340215000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262909134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last-Minute Meetup Makeup Session--Make Some Cards at ArtStudio 360</name><id>12255664</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263146400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/12255664/</event_url></item>
