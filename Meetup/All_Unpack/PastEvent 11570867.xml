TTDB is very excited to offer our second Fencing 101 Class. Here’s how it works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fencing is a sport that can be learned and enjoyed by almost anyone. This sport develops balance, agility and coordination. The physical demands of fencing increase gradually as you learn the particular movements needed for the sport. However, if you can climb a flight of stairs without difficulty, you will be able to learn to fence during our 101 class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be learning at The Boston Fencing Club, the nation’s oldest fencing club, tracing its roots back to 1858. The class will include a brief overview of the sport, introduction to basic techniques and an opportunity to spar with your fellow students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join TTDB for the real thing! Come out and try something new with some great people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Attire: Participants should wear athletic clothing (sweatpants, t-shirts, sneakers). No shorts. All equipment will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: 110 Clematis Ave.&lt;br /&gt;Building #2, Waltham, MA 02453&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an issue with needing public transportation, please contact me to see if we can work something out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google Maps: &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS333US335&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tab=wl&amp;amp;q=www" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $20.00&lt;br /&gt;If purchased by 11/13/09&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must purchase your ticket on our site &lt;a href="http://www.thingstodoboston.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.thingstodoboston.com&lt;/a&gt; - RSVPing does not reserve you a spot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259009160000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1382</urlname><id>1275022</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Things To Do: BOSTON</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254922147000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fencing 101</name><id>11570867</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258835400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1382/events/11570867/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/9/global_5450809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
