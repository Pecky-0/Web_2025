The cocktail party has music, good food and great drinks.  Plus it is the meeting place of several different Meetups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the movie, some people have not seen this great movie which swept the Academy Awards this year.  The story as most people know, poor boy meets girls, loses girl, gets on gameshow and is interrogated by police for continuing to know the answers.  But does he win, does he get the girl, is there singing and dancing?  This is not your typical Bollywood film.    See the feel good movie of the year.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I still look like my picture</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242082879000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238250460000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Thursday +Slumdog Millionaire</name><id>10055603</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241740800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/10055603/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
