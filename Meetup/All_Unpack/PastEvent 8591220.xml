Do not go to the part of the State park where the big lake is.  The climbing is located from Reservation rd,  in Deerfield.  Please check w/ me for exact directions if you don't know how to get there or we can meet before driving into the park.  It can get confusing and I don't want people to miss out becasue they are lost :)&lt;br /&gt;I will be parking down at round pond, end of the road basically.  There is a place to swim after too so bring a suit as it may be HOT out that day.  &lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all then&lt;br /&gt;Kellie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the green van and meetup signs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kellie Barr-Foster</member_name><member_id>6992283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219676820000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219329598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pawtuckaway Day</name><id>8591220</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219503600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/8591220/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/1/global_3885009.jpeg</photo_url></item>
