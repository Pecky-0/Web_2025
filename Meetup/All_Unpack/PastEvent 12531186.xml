Brazil had always been a country to which one emigrates; she wanted to know why, all of a sudden it became a country one tries to flee.  &amp;quot;Brazilians Like Myself&amp;quot; addresses issues that are universal, and to which we are confronted every day.  The encounter with a growing, and mostly undocumented, Brazilian community allows us to bear witness to its energy, its vivacity, and its diversity.  This film attempts to work for a larger acceptance of foreigners in their land of exile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/brazil/events/myself" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/brazil/events/myself" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.drclas.har...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to meet and practice your Portuguese and eat something after the movie, we can go to a local cafe after the film. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266016114000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265408872000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brazilian Film Series: Brazilians Like Myself ***FREE***</name><id>12531186</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265842800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/12531186/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/9/global_12955193.jpeg</photo_url></item>
