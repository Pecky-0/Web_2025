Can you beat that?? We're puling all the stops. A little about BTR: We are a Forex Trading Co. based in Boston &amp;amp; NYC and unfortunately we won't be in the Orlando area for another 6mos so please keep that in mind about this seminar--we really want to reach out and &amp;quot;spread the word&amp;quot; about the opportunities to be had in the forex market and get our man Devrim &amp;quot;Dev&amp;quot; Akyil out there in the public spotlight as well. Most of all we're looking for some special individuals to join our team and possibly represnt BTR in Orlando.
