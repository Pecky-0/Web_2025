<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Thanks to those (9) who showed up for our September meeting, good discussion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the date: October 15, since the Monday the week before is when Columbus Day is observed, so people might not be around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: We'll be meeting at Z Square, 14 JFK St. in Harvard Square, downstairs in the corner alcove with the round table. We have it reserved for 2 hours, 7-9 pm, on the understanding that everyone who shows up agrees to spend $10 (or more). I hope that's agreeable to everyone since after all we have to make it worthwhile for the restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topic: For October, we'll consider the the status of values in the natural world. Are they objective or real in any sense, other than being the contingent product of culture and evolution? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here are some readings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYTimes article on Haidt: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/science/18mora.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=science" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nytimes.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EO Wilson: &lt;a href="http://webpages.charter.net/dwhitlo2/wilson1.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://webpages.chart...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there, and please RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192662209000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189469245000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Allies of Naturalism October Meetup</name><id>6333416</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192489200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/6333416/</event_url></item>
