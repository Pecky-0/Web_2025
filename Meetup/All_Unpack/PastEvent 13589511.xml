Which is what we’ll be doing on Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if anyone else wants to admit to something, like pulling that chair out from under Wendy in 1st grade, we’ll be listening and possibly taking notes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll start off by admitting that I’m addicted to useless facts. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>3324571</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276650862000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274800776000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's celebrate Arkansas Admission Day with some writing exercises!</name><id>13589511</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276642800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/13589511/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
