Not for food, but for metalworking sculpture.   They're also having the grand unveiling of the completed grounds, now that all of the work has been completed on cleanup of former heavy soils from years of industrial use.  Come see what the The Steelyard and its occupants are up to, get a tour of the grounds and how the grounds were capped and learn about the classes that are available and start soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.thesteelyard.org/events/calendar/2010/9/25/164" target="_blank"&gt;The Steelyard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teams of artists and fabricators compete in our 3rd annual head-to-head sculpture competition. Four teams – three rounds – one IRON CHEF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the main event, stick around for the sculpture auction where you’ll have a chance to bid on your favorite piece! Food and refreshments will be available by local food vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get there at noon to help us celebrate the completion of our environmental cleanup! Yardie treats, site tours and demonstrations from 12 – 1 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 1-5 teams will be competing in a sculpture creation competition, and  a silent auction of sculpture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be where the action is...8).
