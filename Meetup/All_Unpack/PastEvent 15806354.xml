Karaoke this week on Thursday @Haluwa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be in the mood for chinese! (I love their Peking Ravioli, Rice w/Shrimp and Chicken Fingers!) Watch their Scorpion bowls, they seem to have a REAL affect! lol &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They always do a great job and they have a great group of regulars. They love the Meetup group when we come to Piano Night and Karaoke Night! You can sing and dance and eat; be part of our big group songs like Love Shack and Paradise by the Dashboard Light (where no one can tell if you're even singin'!); or just watch and cheer/laugh us on! They'll have the big TVs on local games as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haluwa is off exit 6w in Nashua in the Nashua Mall, just beyond Denny's &amp;amp; Radio Shack, but before Shortys. We'll start at 8, karaoke is at 9, til closing around 1!. We're usually in the center section of the club, where we can add tables as we add people thru the night! So don't be afraid to come late if you have to. We've had some big crowds there and the late comers keep us up to the end! And we have fun with other groups there too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom D'A 603-521-7610 before, c603-682-2412 during&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signs or look for the loud crowd, in the middle of the room ;)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293207141000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
