Or you can stop by the retail area at Best Friends, as always all retail will be 20% off.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Best Friends will be collecting for their &amp;quot;Angel Tree&amp;quot;. The Angel Tree benefits local shelters and rescues and provides a Happy Holiday for those pets who do not have forever homes yet. Please donate to this wonderful cause. You can check out the photos of the pets in need on the tree and donate something specifically for that pet or something in general for the shelter/rescue.  The tree is located in the lobby at Best Friends.  This year we are supporting Lowell Humane, Nashua Humane, Kitty Angels, MSPCA Methuen, and New England Basset Rescue.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that EVERYONE must check in at the front desk and have updated VACCINES! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, we require proof of Rabies, Distemper, and Bordatella. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!!&lt;br /&gt;Angela &amp;amp; Team at Best Friends :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Tyngsboro</member_name><member_id>3988390</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232295502000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>small Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-78</urlname><id>467180</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227976093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Yankee Swap</name><id>9246481</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229875200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-78/events/9246481/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/1/e/global_4283150.jpeg</photo_url></item>
