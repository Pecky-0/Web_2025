Saturday October 20, 20102&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:00 PM to 5:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Come join us in this 3.0 hour (4 mile) extremely picturesque hike alongside the babbling Falulah Brook where we will pass waterfalls, wading pools, Fitchburg's water supply, a scenic gorge and a small cemetery. We'll continue on to Overlook reservoir where we'll stop to have a snack then head back. &lt;br /&gt;

We'll start from the kiosk described below, hike thru the Flat Rock Wildlife Sanctuary then onto Falulah brook. &lt;br /&gt;

An extensive trail system traverses the sanctuary and park and leads you through a number of habitats including rocky ledges, hemlock groves, dry upland forest and wetlands. Look for signs of deer, fox and coyote along the trails. Hike leader: Richard F. Home phone 978-400-5564. Plan to arrive 15 minutes early unless you know the kiosk location described below.&lt;/p&gt;
