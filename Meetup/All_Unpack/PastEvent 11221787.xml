Any of you who watched the weather with Hilton Caderly used to watch the radar loop spin around in north central Connecticut.  This is where that radar was stationed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are hiking the Shenipsit Trail in the state's blue blaze system.  This will be a 9 mile in, up, loop, dirt road, and out- kind of a trip.  This a beautiful section with great views of Massachusetts from the top at 1075'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The hike would start from the trailhead on Hopkins Rd., a dirt road just off of Rte. 140 in Ellington across from Lake Bonair. The hike will be moderate with a fair amount of up/down on the trail.  Plan on being out for in the wilderness for 5, no more than 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet and park on the shoulder of the Hopkins Rd. dirt road about .1 mile from the intersection with Rte. 140 at 10 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan on wearing hiking boots and bring at least a quart of water and some trail food/lunch for energy.  We will break at the top.  We still need bug spray and possibly sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total distance from Hopkins Rd. start - some landmarks we will intersect:&lt;br /&gt;* 2.9 miles to trail intersect with Sykes Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 3.4 miles to trail intersect with Parker Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 4.6 miles to peak &amp;amp; observation tower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location/Directions via MapQuest for Hopkins Rd. approximate trailhead (on right of Rd.):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;address=%5b1%2d19%5d%20Hopkins%20Rd&amp;amp;city=Ellington&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;zipcode=06029&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;location=4YWq4%2f6LEHnb7KcPQYTqXzAZv9Lg3%2f%2bvvkDT5UtoEdqBJjTWFKz7f9MGRaO7yalWkG3OIleRkDXgncOOFEjdbgEHM25yoblV3Z%2f25Jm6jZSLP4J7onkQFrBXU6UfV%2buxDYkYHsfNiIlpZ9flYEQPhg%3d%3d&amp;amp;ambiguity=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail Map at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/stateparks/maps/shenipsitgis.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
