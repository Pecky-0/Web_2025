Being guided will help you relax and let go. It's a nice community of people in a lovely setting in a healing space. Kriya meditation is based on the teachings of Yogananda.  It is a guided meditation meant to bring about a felt sense of divine love into your body, heart and mind.  Some time is also spent in silence. This practice is non-denominational, appropriate for anyone. Kriya practice involves bringing in to your body/mind the higher vibration of unconditional love and light. After we fill ourselves with light, we go into silence. It brings about a peace and an expansion of consciousness. We begin with quick introductions, and end with some sharing and Q&amp;amp;A.  All are welcome!
