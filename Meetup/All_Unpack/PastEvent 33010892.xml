 &lt;br /&gt;

Since the 1980s when near death experiences became part of the public consciousness, they have held endless fascination for us. Why? They have confirmed what mystics have been telling us since the beginning of time: ours is not a random universe, our soul lives on after our physical death, and our life has a purpose. Bridging science and mysticism, Dr. Raider draws parallels between near-death experiences and the meditation experience. He will finish with a short meditation period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in Nordic Hall, to the right of the entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy Glassman</member_name><member_id>6837888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316272719000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-582</urlname><id>1082356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2300033569</group_lon><name>The Science of Spirituality Meditation Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315670111000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beyond Death: Medical Facts, Mysticism, and Meditation</name><id>33010892</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316268000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-582/events/33010892/</event_url></item>
