The moneys raised help support the weather observatory at the top of the highest peak in the Northeast.  This event runs July 24-26 in North Conway, NH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have registered to be a hiker this year and raise funds for the cause.  I would enjoy the support and/or company of those who would like to tackle this challenge.  As was said to me on a difficult New Hampshire hike, &amp;quot;Anyone can climb anything with enough time and we have all day&amp;quot;.  I have set this as a goal....a big one for myself.  You can make this your goal also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to www.seekthepeak.org to read more about the event, register as a hiker, or make a pledge uner my name JaniceMay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hike with a Purpose!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Janice</member_name><member_id>3804430</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248693312000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243125837000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt.
