<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;No Limit Texas Hold 'Em Tournament at Ken's in Glastonbury. Beginners are welcome. It's a $20 buy in with no rebuys or addons. Please bring an extra $1.00 to pass along to Mitch for Meetup website fees as well. A couple of snacks and soda will be provided, but feel free to also bring along a snack. BYOB. This is a ONE-table tournament so PLEASE: If you RSVP and then find you can't attend, change your RSVP as soon as possible so someone can take your place. If we have 8 players, the payouts will be $80, $50, and $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with 1000 worth of chips. Blinds will start at 10-20 and go up every 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to email me with any questions! Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The starting time for this tournament is 7 PM, not 7:10 or 7:30. Please be on time. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:30. Please don't arrive at 7:10 and expect to play unless you've called ahead to say you'll be late. In other words, if you're not here AT 7:00 and I haven't heard from you (or been able to reach you), I WILL assume you're not coming. It's really NOT that hard to pick up the phone and keep us posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never played before, don't hesitate to come! First, because the best (and really only) way to get comfortable with tournament poker is to DO IT! Second, because we're a very friendly group and we'll be patient with you as you pick up the basics. Third, because, as a beginner, experienced players will find you very unpredictable. This makes you a viable threat, and you may even end up winning!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken Selig</member_name><member_id>11333429</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1345928176000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344200261000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>TEXAS HOLD'EM AT KEN'S</name><id>76461422</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345849200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/76461422/</event_url></item>
