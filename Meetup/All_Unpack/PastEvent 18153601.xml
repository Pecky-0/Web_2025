The NHSPA is a group of fantastic photographers, and they put on a number of excellent talks, trips, and exhibitions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So You Need a Website Lecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the business meeting, NHSPA member John Hauschildt will give an illustrated lecture, "So You Need a Website."&amp;nbsp; John runs one of the oldest Website development firms in the country, Newcastle Technology Advisors, as well as two related business technology firms. He has lectured around the US and in Europe on technology, business, and photography topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;So You Need a Website,&amp;rdquo; John will walk us through the possibilities and processes of building a successful photography website, the myriad of &amp;ldquo;dos and donts&amp;rdquo; every website owner will need to consider, what to expect from social media services like Facebook and Twitter, how to deal with emerging mobile devices, and where to go next.&amp;nbsp; All materials, links, and references will be made available for later reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting There&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuller Hall is at the corner of Hanover and Pine Streets in Manchester, NH. There is a small parking lot off Pine Street behind the building, or you can park on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Goings-On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Come to Manchester early and check out the John Brooks furniture/sculpture show at the Currier; stay afterwards and enjoy the food and drink at The Republic, NHSPA's best restaurant (and Manchester's best in ten categories!&amp;nbsp; If other members own restaurants where we are meeting, let me know, I'll advertise you too.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also,&amp;nbsp;find&amp;nbsp;out about two trips the NHSPA is taking to Star&amp;nbsp;Island&amp;nbsp;this summer, and this Fall's show with the Camera Club of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Exeter England. If you're not a member of the NHSPA, these events might change your mind about investing $25.&lt;/p&gt;
