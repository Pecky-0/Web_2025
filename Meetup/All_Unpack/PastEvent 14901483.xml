Please, when you arrive, walk the trail down to the fenced in Dog Run, as this is the actual off leash part of the park.  If you do not know where to go, or are unfamiliar with the park trail, please let Kaitlyn Nadeau know so she can arrange to meet you.   &lt;br /&gt;Basic directions: Once in the parking lot, in the back of the lot to the left of the Riverside Park sign there is a trail (there is a garden in between the trail head and sign that is off limits to dogs) Follow the trail for a short walk (maybe 5 minutes) and you'll come down a hill, and see that the trail goes right or left, GO LEFT and the fenced in area is visible from there! :)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE &lt;br /&gt;Looks like the weather is going to be great! A nice cool fall day! :) Don't forget to RSVP. Looking forward to meeting lots of new friends! The website is up to date if you want more information regarding the park! www.dogparknh.org &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE  &lt;br /&gt;HI Everyone! I am really looking forward to this meet up at Riverside Bark.  I wanted to also spread the word that this park's website is now updated, and will be a great resource for local dog owners to meet up with other friends! Visit the link below and you can stay in the loop for current happenings at the park, as well as find the facebook page for yet another great way to network with other local dog owners!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEET UP DETAILS: &lt;br /&gt;Kaitlyn Nadeau is hosting a meetup here starting at 10:00 am.  She plans on staying there 10:00 am - 12:00 pm.  This park has both trails through the woods and a fenced in dog park with one enclosure.   There have been numerous meetups there in the past.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dogparknh.org" target="_blank"&gt;Riverside Bark Dog Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My 2 black doggies always wear bells on their collars, that's how you'll know it's me! :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaitlyn Nadeau</member_name><member_id>12987531</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286809125000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285527101000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Riverside Bark Dog Park, Raymond, NH</name><id>14901483</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286632800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/14901483/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/3/global_8015155.jpeg</photo_url></item>
