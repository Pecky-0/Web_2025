Furthermore, you will educate the group on your expertise and they will do the same for you, so you build the confidence in one another to recommend your business to your personal and professional contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold Star Club networkers develop long-lasting reciprocal relationships based on the basic principle of give and receive and the law of reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best lead referrals come from those that understand your business value proposition and have built a trusting, business relationship with you, so they know you will take care of their other precious business contacts.&lt;br&gt;

You may find that the best time and the most profitable time of your day was at your Gold Star meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good referral is not a TIP. The difference between a "tip" and a "referral" is that the person giving the referral has spoken to the customer about you and the customer is expecting your call. We pass REFERRALS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good referral is when you give someone you care about to someone you know, like and trust.&lt;br&gt;

A good referral paves the way and gives the business person third-party credibility. Your Gold Star Club can be a reliable source of referrals for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.78</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1241214835000</created><lat>42.6500015259</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>381</id><urlkey>entrepreneur</urlkey><name>Entrepreneur</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2027</id><urlkey>realestateagent</urlkey><name>Real Estate Agent</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>4422</id><urlkey>socialnetwork</urlkey><name>Social Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>10117</id><urlkey>businessnetwork</urlkey><name>Business Strategy and Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15236</id><urlkey>business-networking</urlkey><name>Business Networking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15417</id><urlkey>business-owners</urlkey><name>Business Owners</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15903</id><urlkey>business-and-social-networking</urlkey><name>Business and Social Networking</name></topics_item></topics><name>Gold Star Referral Clubs - Boston</name><id>1447978</id><members>141</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>12577782</member_id><name>Piper Turgeon</name></organizer><urlname>Business-Strategy-and-Networking-Gold-Star-Boston</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/a/2/600_113660642.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/a/2/highres_113660642.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>113660642</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/0/a/2/thumb_113660642.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Lowell</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Business-Strategy-and-Networking-Gold-Star-Boston/</link><lon>-71.3099975586</lon></item>
