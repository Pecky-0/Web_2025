The table seemed to have risen a little toward the sky like a mechanical dancing platform, giving the people around it a sense of being alone with each other in the dark universe, nourished by its only food, warmed by its only lights.&amp;quot; -- from &amp;quot;Tender is the Night&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fitzgerald distilled much of his tempestuous life with his wife Zelda in this tender, supple and poetic portrait. To the just-fashionable French Riviera come Dick and Nicole Diver--handsome, rich, glamorous and enormous fun. Their dinners are legend, their atmosphere magnetic, their intelligence fine. But something is wrong. Nicole has a secret and Dick a weakness. Together they head towards the rocks on which their lives crash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Gatsby was a tour de force, but this is a confession of faith.&amp;quot; -- F. Scott Fitzgerald&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clue to unlocking the novel lies in the epigraph, a freely quoted excerpt from John Keats' &amp;quot;Ode to a Nightingale&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Already with thee! tender is the night.&lt;br /&gt;â€¦ But here there is no light,&lt;br /&gt;Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown&lt;br /&gt;Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277240069000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275888024000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fitzgerald: Tender is the Night</name><id>13721391</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277071200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/13721391/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
