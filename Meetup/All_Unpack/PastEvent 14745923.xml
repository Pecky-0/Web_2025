We'll vote for the best hat / best outfit. Labyrinth walking also available, weather permitting, and our very popular optional psychic readings (10-15 minutes for $20). We had so much fun at the 1899 Tea last summer, we're doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cooler weather may allow for more fun creating a fanciful tea costume to lend a turn-of-the-last-century air, if you're up for that sort of thing. Reserve your place with a non-refundable deposit , to allow us time to order appropriate quantities of scones and all the fixings. Please note: since we will be buying refreshments, [i]we can't fully refund deposits for no-shows[/i] - hope you understand. See below for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pay by check if you don't want to use Paypal. Email to let us know and mail your check for $20 to Alchemy Enterprises PO Box 49 Nahant MA 01908. Must be received by Thursday September 15. We will adjust the attendee #s accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event cost is $20 cash or check in advance/ $21 via Paypal/Credit Card. Late registration/payment may be available for $25 cash only at the door.
