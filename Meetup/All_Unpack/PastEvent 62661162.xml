 RAIN SNOW CANCELS THIS EVENT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go for a bike ride on the Windham Depot Rail Trail. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I thought that we would bike to Salem (3 ½ miles) then head to Derry (an additional 2 ½ miles north from the parking lot) and when we return, we could have a bite to eat or an ice cream at the Country Store at the corner of Depot &amp;amp; N Lowell Rd, then bike back to the parking lot. Plan on spending anywhere from 2 ½ to 4 hours for this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 2:00 pm at the Depot Rd parking lot in Windham, NH. Please follow these directions. From route 111 take N. Lowell Rd, drive till you see Depot Rd on your right. Take the right and the parking is on your right about 1000 ft further on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring your sunscreen, insect repellent and lots of fluids and dress in layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897. There is no need to RSVP no!&lt;/p&gt;
