Networking and working together can only be enhanced by getting to know each other and building our connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be for several of Trish's meetups – a great chance to cross-pollinate! You never know what creativity, innovation and provocative thoughts can come from the mix of entrepreneurship, arts, sustainability, spirituality and eros! For those of you that are single – wear a sticker on your badge to show your interest in meeting other singles.  We will start of the evening with cocktails and conversation and move into dancing as the evening progresses. Join us for some great company, stimulating conversation and maybe even some groovy moves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please Bring EITHER: Something significant to share such as a good bottle of wine, an appetizer or dessert (no chips or bread unless part of an appetizer please!)  OR $10 to contribute towards the basic food and drink I will be providing. (If you are unable to contribute for financial reasons please come anyway.) :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loose Schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversation, Networking, General Schmoozing: 7-9pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dancing, Singing, Etcetera: 9-12am&lt;/p&gt;
