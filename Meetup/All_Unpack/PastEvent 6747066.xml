This is a new Italian Restaurant which I have heard very good things about and it is just past Buckland Mall heading toward Manchester.  We all will need a nice relaxing night out, good food and fun after the hectic holidays!  Please RSVP by Jan. 1st.  No &amp;quot;maybe(s)&amp;quot; - too hard to coordinate a firm count!  Looking forward to see you both old and new members!  Judy C.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be extra early - meet you all in the bar area.  I called Carrabba's and it is very elegant in the bar with plenty of seating and just as nice as the rest of the restaurant.  I will bring along a balloon so, you can spot our group!
