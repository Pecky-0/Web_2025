&lt;p&gt;Review from Amazon:&amp;nbsp; "Tender and funny, Manju Kapur's third novel is an engrossing story of family life, across three generations of Delhi shopkeepers. When their traditional business - selling saris - is increasingly sidelined by the new fashion for jeans and stitched salwar kameez, the Banwari Lal family must adapt. But, instead of branching out, the sons remain apprenticed to the struggling shop, and the daughters are confined to the family home. As envy and suspicion grip parents and children alike, the need for escape - whether through illicit love or in the making of pickles or the search for education - becomes ever stronger. Very human and hugely engaging, "Home" is a masterful novel of the acts of kindness, compromise, and secrecy, that lie at the heart of every family."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New restaurant for us -- Harvest of India, between Central and Harvard Squares.&amp;nbsp; As always with restaurants in Cambridge... strongly recommend taking the T or arriving early to allow extra time for parking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Books on the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorothy Drennen</member_name><member_id>2879015</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308523920000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>"'Entralling, convincing, absorbing...
