Unfortunately we won't be able to sit together, but I will get there at 1:30 pm if you want to connect before the show, and if people are interested in dinner somewhere afterwards, let me know (maybe Jacob Wirth's? I'm open to suggestions) and I'll post it as a separate event if I can figure out what time the show is over. &lt;a href="http://www.wickedthemusical.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wickedthem...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anna</member_name><member_id>404606</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286045576000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270150726000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Wicked" at the Boston Opera House </name><id>13060854</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286040600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/13060854/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/d/global_14066861.jpeg</photo_url></item>
