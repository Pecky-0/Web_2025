She covers major artists from the delta to east coast piedmont style players such as Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, Blind Boy Fuller and Memphis Minnie along with mandolin players such as Yank Rachell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her passionate expression of these old songs comes from a love of the music and the arrangements themselves, as well as what she says is an appreciation for &amp;quot;the history of these folks and the difficult circumstances they endured.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marylou has honed her craft listening to the old recordings and learning from some of the great blues players today such as Paul Rishell, Guy Davis, Robert Jones and mandolin great Rich DelGrosso. Marylou has taught at The Cellar Studio, Salem MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &amp;quot;Marylou is a killer. I have watched her grow, and now she's taking over. Blues lovers look out!&amp;quot;...
