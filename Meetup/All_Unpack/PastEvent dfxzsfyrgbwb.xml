&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic dance night on hump day.  The band goes on at 8-11:30.  I will be there after 8:30 due to a work function that evening.  I will have to miss a portion of their music to my regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roxy would rather not have wall flowers so if you want to dance, come out and PARTY! They do encourage anyone that can play in a band to join them.  Eldin from the Bernadettes was there to sing some numbers on 4/3.  He may be there again.  Requests are welcome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I know it's a Wednesday, but what else is going on for a hump day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ciao,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
