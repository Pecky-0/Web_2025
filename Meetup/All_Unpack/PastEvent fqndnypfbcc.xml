This is NOT a venue for job seekers, self-promotion networkers, commissioned sales reps that are not independent business owners, get rich quick or Multi Level Marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're a small group of business owners (and sometimes busniness owner wannabes) sharing ideas on how to profitably run and grow a business. Rather than sit back and wait for referrals we will discuss what actions we can take to build relationships with other business owners and strengthen our professional image.&lt;/p&gt;
