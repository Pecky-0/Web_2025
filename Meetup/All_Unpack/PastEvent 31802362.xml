&lt;p&gt;We had such a wonderful time at Jake and JOES and I am back on track with my once monthly meet ups!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that we play it by ear and see what the weather brings in terms of where we decide to settle down in Marina Bay.&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of places to choose from with both indoor and outdoor seating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always- I ask that you PLEASE update your RSVP prior to the event so that I can make an appropriate reservation.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, 6 women did not do this for the last meet up and I wound up with an incomplete reservation and wasting time and space at the restaurant.&amp;nbsp; I cannot stress how much of an inconvenience this is.&amp;nbsp; Please respect your membership and the rest of the group and rsvp appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay- I am getting off the soap box....just had to get that out:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's make this another wonderful night out ladies!&amp;nbsp; As always, the more new faces the better!!&lt;/p&gt;
