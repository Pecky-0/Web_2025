&lt;p&gt;Fee of $20 to $35 includes a repair manual and lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to the Bike Repair and Information Workshop to improve your bike knowledge and ride preparedness! It is worthwhile for both new and experienced riders wanting more information and more confidence on the road and trail. Matters addressed include: &lt;br /&gt;

• types of bikes &lt;br /&gt;

• maintenance &lt;br /&gt;

• clothing and equipment &lt;br /&gt;

• riding technique &lt;br /&gt;

Concepts and repairs will be discussed and demonstrated at four stations: basic bike, general maintenance, flat tires, and brakes &amp;amp; derailleurs. Attend all four stations. Receive an extensive handout to take home. During lunch discuss with the instructors topics such as touring, safety, bike accessories, bike clothing, what to carry with you on a ride, finding bike routes, and where to shop. &lt;br /&gt;

Advance registration is recommended. Prices are: &lt;br /&gt;

 AMC Member Non-Member &lt;br /&gt;

Adult $30 $35 &lt;br /&gt;

Youth (12-18) $20 $25 &lt;br /&gt;

and $40 at the door for all. &lt;br /&gt;

REGISTER &lt;br /&gt;

Arrive by 9:45 to sign in. Bring the front wheel from your bike (it is easier to remove than the rear; try this well in advance of the workshop if you are unfamiliar with the procedure), tire irons, and a pump to practice fixing flats, but NOT your bike (sorry, space is limited). &lt;br /&gt;

Lunch will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Barry</member_name><member_id>7898976</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364066018000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1363736516000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Repair Workshop</name><id>110077582</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>18900000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1364046300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/110077582/</event_url></item>
