&lt;p&gt;Please mark your calendars for Women Making Music: Honoring the Work of Musicologist Judith Tick, a Public Talk and Gala Concert, taking place on Sunday February 3 at Brandeis University. The events, which include a 3:30 p.m. public talk by Dr. Judith Tick (Distinguished University Professor, Northeastern University) at the Women's Studies Research Center and a 7:00 p.m. gala concert at Slosberg Recital Hall, will celebrate the 25th anniversary of Dr. Tickï¿½s groundbreaking anthology, Women Making Music: The Western Art Tradition 1150-1950. Both offerings are being presented by The Women and Music Mix, a vital group of musician-scholars within the WSRC, in collaboration with numerous dignitaries of the Boston music scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening concert will feature premieres of Ruth Lomon's oratorio Rebekah (excerpt) and of Dana Maiben's song cycle The Green House, songs of Fanny Mendelssohn accompanied on the Brandeis 1827 Viennese fortepiano, works by Maria Teresa Agnesi, and Ruth Crawford Seeger's searing violin sonata of 1926. Performers include pianist Sarah Bob, male soprano Robert Crowe, mezzo-soprano Pamela Dellal, violinist Gabriela Diaz, conductor Jane Ring Frank, gambist Laury Gutierrez and La Donna Musicale, the Mockingbird Trio (alto Elizabeth Anker, pianist John McDonald, and violist Scott Woolweaver), fortepianist Vivian Montgomery, violinist Dan Stepner and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation Dr. Tick will take place at the WSRC, Epstein Building, 515 South St., Brandeis University, Waltham, and is free of charge (although reservations are required at info@wammix.org), and the 7:00 p.m. gala concert will take place at Slosberg Recital Hall, 415 South St., Brandeis University, Waltham.
