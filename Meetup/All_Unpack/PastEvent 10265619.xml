Our Meetups are the highlight of our month and we look forward to LOTS of good times in 2009. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little smaller group for our April Meetup than usual, but I suspect that was because of the unusually warm indian summer day! Kelly and I may actually not make the May Meetup, but rest assured we will still be having it on the 30th. We are doing a bike race in the morning and will try to make it. We have asked Erin and Eric as well as Julie, Puggo's mom the Assistant Organizers to come early and set up and Diana's mom offered to make snacks so you all won't go hungry! If anyone else could pitch in, that would be great too. Hopefully Donna will take lots of pictures in case we don't make it! The money from the last Meetup is being put to good use for advertising banners for Curly Tail Pug Rescue, so thank you all for your monthly donations. It's only $5 but it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will shoot for July to do our first annual cookout that we've been talking about so feel free to email us with questions or ideas and we will lock everything down in June. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been seeing lots of new faces which is so nice and as always lots of familiar faces and steady friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know how much our precious puggies hate the cold, so hopefully now that the weather is getting nice we will start to see more beautiful smooshed in faces old and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2009 promises to bring a ton of Puggie fun, including our first annual Pug Meetup barbecue...details to come....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and I truly enjoy being the organizers of the Grafton pug Meetup. We hope that we have met each of you individually, and if we have not, please come up and introduce yourself at the next one. We are constantly trying to come up with new treats for our precious pugs, and ideas to keep it informative and interesting. We welcome all suggestions. It seems to be very personal and we all have tons of fun.  We always welcome new members to come join in the fun and excitement at watching our little puggie friends romp and play in the spacious room at the Gibson Kennel in Grafton. Note: &lt;b&gt;this is a PUG meetup&lt;/b&gt;...as not all breeds play well together.  There are other small breed Meetups, but this is for PUGS ONLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this has not been strictly enforced at the meetups but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will ask for a $5 fee per family for each Meetup&lt;/b&gt; to cover Meetup costs and any leftover money will be donated to the Curly Tail Pug Rescue or any other Pug charity that we all agree on as a group. These donations go toward paying the monthly dues, snacks and to keep this website going so we can all see when the next meetup is taking place.  We will also do special events from time to time to keep it fun and interesting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will introduce ourselves...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>erin maguire</member_name><member_id>3828727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246121349000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240683345000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Pug May Meetup</name><id>10265619</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243702800000</time><rsvp_limit>60</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/10265619/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/a/global_8419338.jpeg</photo_url></item>
