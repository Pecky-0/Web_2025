No matter how much the mainstream media chooses to ignore him, Ron Paul continues to shine through as the only real limited government constitutionalist in the presidential race. We know what the political and media establishment are really all about: maintaining the status quo. And behind their routine feigned innocence, they know that we know&amp;mdash;and it annoys the hell out of them. The establishment may dominate the old media and its narrative, but the grassroots is online, anti-status quo, and in command of this nation&amp;rsquo;s political direction far more than the establishment would like to admit, or are comfortable with. Western Massachusetts supports Ron Paul! See you Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327787728000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327561958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BLACK THIS OUT NEWS 22</name><id>49688492</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327772700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/49688492/</event_url></item>
