&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Rick's Roadhouse (in the Jewelry District near Olga's Cup&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Saucer, and across the street from The Apartment&amp;nbsp; - you all remember that one from last week, so this shouldn't be difficult to find).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick's Roadhouse is&amp;nbsp;a big, open industrial-feeling space with a large bar and lots o' BBQ! There are huge garage&amp;nbsp;doors that open out&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;patio outside - a big plus when this heat breaks by Monday. I can't believe its been over 2 YEARS since we've had an official MNM at Ricks - shocking!!!&amp;nbsp; So, let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a silver flower in my hair or pinned somewhere, but we're hard to miss and very friendly!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
