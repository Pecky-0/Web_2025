<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi folks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of Jason Webster who will be leaving us for the West coast (rats!), we'll revisit the problem of consciousness. Dualists and supernaturalists make much of the fact that naturalists haven't yet explained consciousness, and claim that this shows the explanatory shortcomings of what they call the &amp;quot;materialist&amp;quot; science that naturalism is based on. They say naturalists should simply accept the fact that there's something irreducibly mental in reality that can't be reduced to material processes, however complex - see &lt;a href="http://centerfornaturalism.blogspot.com/2009/01/science-wars-dualism-vs-materialism.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for instance. But should naturalists give up so easily? Is there good evidence that there's something irreducibly mental out there? If not, then how is it that subjective experiences such as pain, the redness of red, the taste of cinnamon, etc. arise from the workings of the physical brain? A non-dualistic solution to this &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness" target="_blank"&gt;hard problem&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; of consciousness would do a lot to strengthen the case for naturalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;twc  at  naturalism.org  &lt;br /&gt;617-480-8846  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: if you have topics you'd like to discuss or other ideas for future meetups, or meeting spots you like, please suggest them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month):   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring and promoting a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>second floor alcove</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252450928000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247571012000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Can we naturalize consciousness?</name><id>10872552</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250031600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/10872552/</event_url></item>
