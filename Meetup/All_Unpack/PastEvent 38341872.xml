&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you freeze up and not know what to do when someone verbally attacks you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you get angry later on because you didn't stand up for yourself, and then beat yourself up for it for hours after the event has passed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever felt helpless and unsure of what to do when someone makes a snippy or passive aggressive comment to you in front of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever felt the embarrassment of somebody poking fun at you and having fun at your expense, and you wish you knew what to do about it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then this workshop is perfect for you. In this fun and interactive event, you'll learn proven techniques for quickly disarming someone who is being snippy, rude, or flat out verbally abusive toward you. And you can do it without getting angry, without making the other person angry, and without feeling embarrassed or awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************************************************* &lt;br /&gt;

 HERE'S A SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'LL LEARN: &lt;br /&gt;

 *************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My #1 technique that automatically dissolves an attack. Once you master this, you'll be surprised at how easy it is to quickly disarm anyone. An interesting side effect is that this technique instantly discourages them from ever attacking you again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The #1 mistake people make when dealing with a verbal attack that practically &lt;em&gt;forces&lt;/em&gt; the attacker to become even more of a jerk. We often think this will stop the attack, but it almost always makes it worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The surprising truth about what compels people to attack you, and how to instantly put a stop to it. And the crazy part is... the other person might not want to attack you, but they will feel compelled to if you're doing &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple technique will compel the attacker to do a full 180 degree turn and start treating you as if you are their friend. It still boggles my mind when I see how well this works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*************************************************&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 HOW TO GET INVOLVED&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 *************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is it? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This event is going to be at my home in Lower Allston, right near Harvard Business School. It's very easy to get to both by car and public transportation, and there's plenty of on-street parking. Directions will be emailed to you. We will start the event promptly at 3:00pm and run until 5:00pm. Please plan on arriving by 2:45 so you have time to settle in and meet the other guests. You never know who you'll meet that can become a new friend and add a lot of value to your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Cheap. &amp;nbsp;If you took a class like this through an adult education center, you'd easily pay more than $50 to attend, and&amp;nbsp;that's assuming there even&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;a class that could offer you all this. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how much?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because I want to help as many people as I can, I've decided to keep the price very affordable so that anyone who wants to come will be able to. &amp;nbsp;The cost for this event is only $25, which is very low considering the quality of training that you'll be getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it...&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;that's 83 cents a day for a month&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;What else do you spend 83 cents on every day that makes no difference in your social life (or love life) whatsoever? I promise that this will be well worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big is the class?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because this is class is being held at my house and not a large seminar room, I have to limit the size to only 10 students. &amp;nbsp;There are over 800 other people seeing this message, so be&amp;nbsp;sure to put in your RSVP right now in order to lock in your spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$25 cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great attitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a willingness to learn fun, new things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and put in your RSVP right now in order to secure your spot. &amp;nbsp;I'm looking forward to seeing you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warmly,&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
