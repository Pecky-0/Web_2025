So far I have been to a dance and a morning bowling outing. I have had a lot of fun at both.  I am looking forward to more events to share time with new friends.  :)</bio><topics /><name>LA Sutch</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>61613482</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>Nashua</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/61613482</link><visited>1364001129000</visited><lon>-71.47</lon></member>
