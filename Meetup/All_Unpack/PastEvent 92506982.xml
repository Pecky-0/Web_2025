 RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT! &lt;br /&gt;

 Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go hiking or snow shoeing on the Musquash Conservation Area trails in Londonderry NH. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I plan on hiking for approximately two hours, while taking many small breaks along the way. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will meet at 1:00pm sharp, at the Hickory Hill Dr, entrance. Please follow these directions: From the Nashua area: Take NH 111 East turn left on NH 102 East, drive 5.9 miles then turn left on Parmenter Rd, drive 0.4 miles, take a slight right onto High Range Rd, drive 2.5 miles, turn left on Hickory Hill Dr. Drive to the end of the road for the entrance. From the Manchester area: Take NH 128 South (Mammoth Rd), drive 4.0 miles, turn right on Shasta Dr, drive 1.2 miles, turn left on High Range Rd, drive 0.3 miles, take first right on Hickory Hill Dr. Drive to the end of the road for the entrance. Look for a white Toyota or a Meetup sign. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers for comfort. &lt;br /&gt;

 This event is at no cost! I hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;

 Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897 Do not RSVP no. &lt;br /&gt;

 Location: Musquash Conservation Area, Londonderry, NH &lt;br /&gt;
