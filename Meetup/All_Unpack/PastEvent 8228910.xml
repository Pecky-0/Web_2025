A core group of organizers will be setting up Camp on the lawn adjacent to the Stone Man Playground near the Harvard (Mass Ave) Bridge. (link below). From there, we'll break off into groups and canvas the entire area, from and including the Longfellow Bridge to the Harvard Bridge. Even if you can come only for a couple of hours, there will be someone at the Camp at all times beginning at 9 am, who will be able to connect you with groups already out working the crowd. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best access to the home Camp is via the pedestrian entrance to the esplanade at the Mass. Ave Bridge. From there it's just a short 100 ft. walk to a fork in the sidewalk that surrounds a strip of lawn where we're setting up camp. Look for the flag of New England we'll be flying a red flag with a green Pine tree. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have a total of 10,000 pieces of literature we want to distribute among the 500,000-plus people in attendance. We hope you can join us as in this huge distribution effort and for some celebration after the fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI This is a great vantage point to watch the fireworks, so come help us hog our space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flag:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston911truth.org/site/4th/newengflag3.gif" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston911truth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Card&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston911truth.org/site/4th/Patriot911card.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston911truth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Announcement Doc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston911truth.org/site/4th/4th.doc" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston911truth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAC Flyer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston911truth.org/site/4th/WAC-Flyer.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston911truth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston911truth.org/site/4th/map.gif" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston911truth...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Camp on the lawn adjacent to Stone Man Playground near the  (Mass Ave) Bridge</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246686106000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214588342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>9/11 Truth leafleting at the Charles River Esplanade, Boston </name><id>8228910</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215176400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/8228910/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/3/6/global_981894.jpeg</photo_url></item>
