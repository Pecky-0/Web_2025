&lt;p&gt;The festival opens at 4pm with a free screening of "We Are All Cylons" (but you may need to reserve a ticket in advance to guarantee seating). This is followed at 5pm by a free reception. Short film screenings are divided into Fantasy shorts, starting at 7pm, and Sci-Fi shorts, which begin at 9pm; there is an intermission between them. Tickets are $10 for each individual shorts session, or for $15 you can come to the whole shebang. There is even a free after-party, taking place at Redbones (just around the corner in Davis Square) at 11pm! Plenty of opportunities for mingling :o)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are links for the line-up and to buy advance tickets; they will also be selling at the door (if it doesn't sell out before then!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (Cheryl) will be attending the entire festival. I put 3:30 as the start time, to allow fellow attendees time to assemble together before filing in and finding seats. Additional mingling arrangements can also be devised for the reception, intermission, and/or after-party as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347828825000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347232354000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Etheria Sci-fi/Fantasy Film Festival</name><id>81633472</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347737400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/81633472/</event_url></item>
