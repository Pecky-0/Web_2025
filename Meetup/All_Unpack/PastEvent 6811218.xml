They're expecting 2000 people and it was sold out last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm on the planning committee .... the volunteer coordinator. So, you know I'm asking for volunteers! I'm looking for people to help out for 2 or 3 hours that night with raffles, balloon poppers, greeters, hand out party favors, gift bags, registration, etc ... The volunteer jobs are easy and you'll be with people. Volunteers pay only $40 for the entire night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't want to volunteer, there are different levels of pricing, depending on whether or not you come for dinner or the party only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Westin Hotel is giving a huge discount of $169 for rooms that night if you mention The Resolution Ball when you reserve your room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a charity involved as well ... The Ellie Fund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a formal night. Guys wear either a suit or a tux. Women wear either a short or long cocktail dress. The party is open to couples and singles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the following sites for more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostoneventguide.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostoneven...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.elliefund.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.elliefund....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.felixbrown.com/live/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.felixbrown...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1528&amp;amp;EM=VTY_WI_bostonwaterfront_1528_overview" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.starwoodho...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please indicate in your response if you're interested in volunteering that night.
