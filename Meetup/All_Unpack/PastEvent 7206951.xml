Holiday parties are the most attended.  For these events the Gallery will have a top 40 DJ and a band.  The Gallery has two levels and fits 500 people comfortably.  I have been to some of their dances and they are very festive and fun.  $14.00 gets you a buffet dinner and good company.  First timers are seated together for dinner.  There is always a good mix of people and the majority are 30 something and older.   For holiday parties most dress in nice attire, and jeans are not excluded.  My experience is that everyone is friendly, easy going, and open to meeting others for love and friendship...more info can be found on www.singlesdances.com.  For those interested we will meet to car pool near exit 5 on the Mass Turnpike.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>4671887</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206492696000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1514</urlname><id>824401</id><group_lat>42.0999984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5899963379</group_lon><name>Single Mingle Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201459145000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Singles Holiday Party </name><id>7206951</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203292800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1514/events/7206951/</event_url></item>
