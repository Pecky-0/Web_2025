This was also a suggestion from one of our most consistent members, Claire. There is valet parking. I've decided to charge members the fee ahead of time since I fail to do at each meeting. The six month cost for this site is 72.00. and since there is such difficulty at the time when the check comes, some people end up covering the cost of the meal for other members. Its difficult to ask for 2.00, more. Please read the policy about how the check will be handled , the total bill for food will be divided equally by the number of people in attendance, the only exception being alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240613323000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-617</urlname><id>790320</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Dining Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236700298000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dine out Meetup - Downcity Diner</name><id>9923331</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238281200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-617/events/9923331/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/e/global_4123038.jpeg</photo_url></item>
