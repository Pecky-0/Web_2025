We will set up the badminton net and toss lots of yummy meat and veggies on the grill, I am even going to make my homemade BBQ sauce for those that feel so inclined!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a BYO party - bring your own, for those who don't know - so bring whatever you would like to toss on the grill and drink.  We'll try to organize some dessert.  I'll also BBQ up some ribs for everyone to share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the calendar, I think this will be the only weekend that will work for us in July.  Please note, if the weather is not cooperating we may postpone to sometime in August - but you will be informed of this.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ring Doorbell</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brad Taylor</member_name><member_id>1999104</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216073275000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214509746000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brad and Nele BBQ</name><id>8222108</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215900000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/8222108/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
