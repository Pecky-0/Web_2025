You'll see that we're pretty focused on road for the time being but perhaps enough interest will actually form a group to tackle some local trails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks get a little confused by the title "Grind &amp;amp; Grub" - not terribly creative I'm afraid. "Grind" because of the bikes. "Grub" because I like to think most people work best on the reward-system. You break a sweat, burn your quads a bit and then enjoy some food/drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;I try to schedule our rides with a social element to follow. A quick 15 mile ride with a beer or two at a local pub - what could be better?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nervous about your ability to keep up with the group? Look, we all come in different shapes and sizes and that goes for our bikes too. More often than not we'll have a 'sweeper' (someone who purposefully rides last to ensure that no one is left behind) on these rides. I also try to make route maps for everyone. But it's completely natural for the group to organically divide itself up depending on speed. Just know thyself and your own threshold :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just ask that you come with a good attitude and an open-mind. And a helmet. And water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just use your head!&lt;/p&gt;
