Learn how to use this process to reduce resistance on an issue where you're feeling &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; or feel like you’re not moving forward so that you may get into your Vibrational Escrow.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be molding the clay here and having fun with our individual desires……as Abraham says, &amp;quot;We are always evolving so you never get it wrong because you never get it done!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;Shannon Brophy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/members/121214/"&gt;http://lawofattractio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Conley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/members/7459189/"&gt;http://lawofattractio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Buck</member_name><member_id>2466801</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chew-Hoong</member_name><member_id>3101506</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242265570000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Law of Attraction Co-Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lawofattraction-us</urlname><id>368525</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239737268000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Abraham Hicks Discussion</name><id>10184592</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240441200000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lawofattraction-us/events/10184592/</event_url></item>
