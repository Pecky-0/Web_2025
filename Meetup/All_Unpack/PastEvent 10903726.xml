After an hour or so of writing any who would like can commence to Charlie's Kitchen in Cambridge to help one of our devout members and fearless leaders Kate celebrate her day of birth are welcome to do so!  Can you really imagine a world without our beloved, bubbly Kate?  I shudder at the thought and scoff at such a place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come for some writing and serious karaoke!  I'm sure some with partake in a drink or two or...oh who's counting!  Let's have some fun :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249430453000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247931994000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Writing Meetup/ Kate's Bday Extravaganza!</name><id>10903726</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248822000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/10903726/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
