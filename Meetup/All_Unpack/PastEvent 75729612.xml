&lt;p&gt;Each of the five Executive Councilors represents one fifth of the population or approximately 247,000 citizens. Councilors are elected every two years, concurrently with the Governor. The Councilors participate in the active management of the business of the state. They receive assistance from the Commissioner of the Department of Administrative Services and the Attorney General who review requests involving state funds since no expenditure can be legally authorized without the availability of adequate funds.&lt;/p&gt;
