The format is similar (although not identical) to Stump Trivia, and Meghna Chakrabarti from WBUR will be the trivia jockey. Teams are limited to 4/team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is a fundraiser, it's $12 in advance or $15 at the door to play, but all proceeds go to the Boston Book Festival. We're also giving away more than $1000 in gift cards and prizes (from the Boston Book Festival, WBUR, Tommy Doyle's, and a bunch of area bookstores) to the top three scoring teams as well as the team with the best name, so it could definitely be a profitable night for participants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link for registering and pre-payment (save $3!) is here: &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbookfest.org/bookfest/schedule_detail/schedule_literary_trivia_night/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.bostonbookfest.org/bookfest/schedule_detail/schedule_literary_trivia_night/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you register, put "Pub Trivia Meetup" in the "team name" field, and we'll try to place you on the same team (don't worry--you can always change your team name to something more creative once you're there!).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Norah</member_name><member_id>11201436</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344347268000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Trivia Buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Area-Pub-Trivia</urlname><id>1554091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Boston Area Pub Trivia</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343743005000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Book Festival Literary Pub Trivia</name><id>75675402</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344292200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Pub-Trivia/events/75675402/</event_url></item>
