The Lakehouse is 11 miles in on the logging road from Highway 16. follow the markers set up for this event and print out the directions.  try to come before dark- this is a loooooong dark road with no signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take 93 North to exit 35 onto Rt. 3, Go through Lancaster to Rt. 110 in Stark. Take Rt. 110A to Rt.16 North. Stay on Rt. 16 to Errol. In Errol you will take a left (still on Rt. 16) and head towards Rangeley, Maine. We are about 18 miles from Errol.

Bugs should be done for the season, and brave swimmers would be advised to pack earplugs to limit earaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her camp provides coffee/tea, lighting, fishing tackle and bait, refrigeration and cooking appliances for meals, and limited bed space on a half acre. No electricity or running water. Fire wood and grilling equipment, bottled water helpful &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is space for about 6 tents outside.
