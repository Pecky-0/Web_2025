<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so it's not really a hike, but it is a three mile walk, and for a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 28th annual Walk Against Hunger takes place on Sunday, May 1, in Hartford. The event is a fundraiser for Foodshare and several other local anti-hunger charities. I hope you'll consider signing up, asking some friends, family, and co-workers to sponsor you, and coming out to join me. These days, Foodshare is needed more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sign up to walk, follow these easy steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) go to &lt;a href="http://www.foodshare.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.foodshare.org&lt;/a&gt; and click on the Walk Against Hunger logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) click on "Join a team"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) put "Gloria" in the search box and press search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) select "Gloria's Glorious Gang" and follow the steps to join&amp;nbsp;her team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cannot walk, but would like to make a donation to support Gloria and her team, go &lt;a href="http://site.foodshare.org/site/TR/Walk/WalkAgainstHunger?px=1001337&amp;amp;pg=personal&amp;amp;fr_id=1160"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and click on the "support" button to make a secure donation with your credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have signed up, you can raise money using the website tools to e-mail friends and family, or you can print out a brochure and go raise some sponsors the old fashioned way, with paper and pencil! Or, alternatively, if you want a paper brochure, send me an e-mail with your snail mail address and how many brochures you would like and I'll mail them. I can also mail a Walk poster or two if you have a place to hang it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Walk day, come to The Hartford, on Asylum Avenue in Hartford between 1:00 and 1:30 to turn in your pledges and get signed up. Look for me about 1:45 near the stage and the Walk leaves promptly at 2:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there. If you cannot come, but would like to support those of us who are walking, you can go &lt;a href="http://site.foodshare.org/site/TR/Walk/WalkAgainstHunger?px=1001337&amp;amp;pg=personal&amp;amp;fr_id=1160"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to make a donation.&lt;/p&gt;
