How do you know which polls are more reliable? Join Tom Flynn as he explores how sociologists and pollsters measure religious belief and unbelief. He will also cover the controversies and scandals in the polling field, and what the polling data on religion really mean (for example, how many of those “no religious preference” people are really atheists?).&lt;br /&gt;Bring a dish to share for our anniversary potluck dinner. Dinner (with anniversary cake) will be followed by Tom Flynn’s presentation at 8:00 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;Tom Flynn is Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism and the Editor of Free Inquiry magazine. A journalist, novelist, entertainer, and folklorist, Flynn is the author of numerous articles for Free Inquiry, many addressing church-state issues, as well as the best-selling “The Trouble With Christmas,” about which he has made hundreds of radio and TV appearances in his role as the curmudgeonly “anti-Claus.” He is also the author of the critically acclaimed anti-religious black comedy science fiction novels, Galactic Rapture and Nothing Sacred. His latest work, “The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief,” is a comprehensive reference work on the history, beliefs, and thinking of America’s fastest growing minority: those who live without religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start with a pot-luck dinner at 7:30 PM. The main talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about this event and others, please read the write-up on &lt;a href="http://www.cthumanist.org/" target="_blank"&gt;our home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273549712000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271788261000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anniversary Meeting: Who Are These Doubters, Anyway?
