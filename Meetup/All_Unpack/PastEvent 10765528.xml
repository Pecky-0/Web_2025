For me, mojitos are the perfect summer drink. . . that combination of mint and lime with rum and soda or seltzer is the ultimate refresher. But there's one problem. With all that rum, you can't drink too many of them and still make sense!  So my version is heavy on the lime and mint, but light on the rum. . . probably about half the alcohol content you'd expect. Just the thing to drink with barbecued chicken in a mojito-flavored marinade! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll supply the mojito fixings, the chicken, all serving accountrements, and a key lime pie for dessert. Hope this inspires others to concoct side dishes, salads, etc. that will harmonize or contrast with the flavors. Please let us know what you plan to bring when you R.S.V.P.!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk around to the left of the house and you should see us</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob</member_name><member_id>4061181</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1247698239000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246324990000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Mojito Madness" Collaborative Cookout at Iris &amp; Bob's place</name><id>10765528</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246824000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/10765528/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/6/5/global_9425989.jpeg</photo_url></item>
