I've been slacking off over the winter season and want to get back out there. If people are busy that day or if there is a better location you'd recommend, just say so. I just want to get out a bit more. There's a lot of bouldering and some top rope routes as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342442852000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340682762000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pawtuckaway meetup</name><id>70760652</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>21600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342274400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/70760652/</event_url></item>
