(You can keep your socks on if you want.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very informal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 PM - 10 PM, but you can come and go at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See www.westford.com/pca/dance_barefoot_boogie.htm for more details and www.westford.com/pca/directions.htm for driving directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the third Thursday of the month, drop your cares and your shoes at the door and let your inner spirit guide your body through a delightful evening of freestyle dance. DJs spin a wide range of musical styles to inspire the fancy in each of us. You might hear something from blues to bop, swing to salsa, pop to hip-hop, world to twirl, reggae to reggaeton, tango to techno, R&amp;amp;B, country, standards, show tunes - anything! Here you can dance as if no one is watching, by yourself, with newfound friends or drop into one of the temporary groups that seem to form occasionally and spontaneously. This is the upbeat, conscious, wholesome dance opportunity you have been waiting for. Come any time between 7 and 10 and get your workout for the week. Be healthy. Be happy. Just boogie.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll either wear my NEIL cap or have a name tag.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>NeilL</member_name><member_id>3034835</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235261564000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234588533000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Metrowest Boogie barefoot dance</name><id>9739584</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235088000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/9739584/</event_url></item>
