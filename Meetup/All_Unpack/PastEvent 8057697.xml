Driving the ball, teeing off is the first basic part of one's golf game. Whether you aspire to be like Tiger or just want to have some fun all are welcome.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our own meetup member (Warren) has so kindly volunteered to be on hand to help us w/ some basic instructions. And anyone else who has some knowledge as well is welcome to come and help our members  that day. Afterwards, we'll go and grab a bite nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bucket of golf balls cost $8, clubs are included. There are about 60 golf balls to a bucket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;b&gt;If anyone needs a ride&lt;/b&gt;, please note that in your rsvp and maybe someone will be able to give you a ride or meet you somewhere near a T stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info on McGolf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.mcgolfonline.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the group of asians.
