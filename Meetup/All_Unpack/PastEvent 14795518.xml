Started by Kaji Aso over 25 years ago, the studio promotes Japanese and Western cultural connections through visual arts, poetry, music, philosophy, and other Japanese cultural events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaji Aso will be having an open house this Saturday from 6:00 - 8:30 pm (please see their message below) that I highly encourage many of you to attend.  If you are interested in finding new connections to Japan outside of your current language studies and social connections, this may be the place for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note, those that first time students that attend the open house this Saturday eve will be provided an additional 10% discount on upcoming classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ART CLASSES &lt;br /&gt;at Kaji Aso Studio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come visit our &lt;br /&gt;OPEN HOUSE&lt;br /&gt;with FACULTY EXHIBITION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, Sept 18 from 6-8:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drop by!
