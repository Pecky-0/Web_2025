 &lt;br /&gt;

Some of you know about Urban Peaks, but I figured I'd send out a blast to let everyone know about Urban Peaks and about our climbathon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Urban Peaks is a nonprofit that just started that is designed to subsidize funding for underprivileged urban youth to participate in climbing activities in gyms or outside, challenge courses, or team building experiences. (I am the program coordinator for this nonprofit, you can check us out at &lt;a href="http://www.urbanpeaks.org"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.urbanpeaks.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am really excited about this project. For those of you on this list who are climbers, you probably know what I am talking about when I talk about a passion for climbing. I love to climb and am so grateful for what it has given me, what i have learned, the amazing friends i have made and how it has enhanced my life, and think it would be so great to be able to share it with kids who could really benefit from it! Cause let's be honest, who couldn't benefit from having climbing in their lives?!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are running our first 100% fundraising event, Climb for Kids, which is a climb-a-thon scheduled for Saturday, November 19, 2011, 4-10pm, hosted by MetroRock, Everett.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can sign up by emailing me at sara@urbanpeaks.org and I'll email you a pledge sheet. It's $25 to climb for the day (walk-ins welcome), you can either pay that price yourself, or get sponsors to pay.&amp;nbsp; All the proceeds of this event go to Urban Peaks. There will be free pizza and drinks at the event!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope to see you all there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sara Gillers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
