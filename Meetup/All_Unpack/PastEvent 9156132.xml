This is a powerful documentary which features eyewitness accounts and archived news footage that was shot on September 11, 2001 but never replayed on television. Featuring interviews with eyewitnesses &amp;amp; firefighters, along with expert analysis by Professor Steven E. Jones, Professor David Ray Griffin, MIT Engineer Jeffrey King, and Professor James H. Fetzer. This film provides stunning evidence that explosives were used in the complete demolition of the WTC Twin Towers and WTC Building 7. Visit &lt;a href="http://www.911revisited.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.911revisit...&lt;/a&gt; to get the DVD of this movie. [This site may be down).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4194796183168750014" target="_blank"&gt;view the video on Google videos&lt;/a&gt;. This 2006 video mashup of news footage shows how many times the events at the WTC towers were described as &amp;quot;explosions&amp;quot;, however many of these news moments were never repeated - the wording was changed in subsequent news stories to be a &amp;quot;collapse.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have a couple of shorts&lt;/b&gt; to show also: &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;9-11 Cinema Before the Fact&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;The Red Pill&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;quot; These will be a little bonus for us at this month's meeting. We'll give another review of how to use some of the additional features of the meetup site, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll have a discussion&lt;/b&gt; after the video regarding what we can do, including how each person can become more involved in this group and spread the workload of running a meetup like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Special Report&lt;/b&gt; will be given by those who attended the weekend New England 911 Truth Movement Strategy Meeting in Keene on 15 November. Several possible region-wide actions have been suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: 1st Tuesday-Nashua; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; &lt;b&gt;3rd Tuesday-Concord&lt;/b&gt;; 4th Tuesday- Plymouth (we may put Plymouth on hold for a while to re-organize). If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, maybe we'll have a Truth Party somewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at 6:30&lt;/b&gt; if you can, in order to help set up the snacks and beverages (that you bring to share with others) and enjoy the pre-meeting conversations. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and then on to the video showing right after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have set up a &lt;a href="http://mv911t.erideshare.com" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;carpooling group&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; online at eRideShare.com. Ride-sharing arrangements can now be made by clicking on the link above to go to the online ridesharing group.
