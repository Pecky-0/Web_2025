BLUE HILLS HAS NO POWER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8:15AM: still planning to go, check back for time and and meeting place, this looks like heavy wet snow but should turn to powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone want to head over to Blue Hills tomorrow afternoon?  Of course this is dependent on the intensity of the storm, opening time at Blue Hills, if I get my car dug out.  But what the heck - I am optimistic.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never snowboarded (or skied) Blue Hills but you could see it from my home town growing up. I have been waiting for a Boston centered powder day, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Hills does not even open until 2pm but it is only $20 until 6pm.  There may be some delay in opening due to the snow.  I will check back in the morning, please include phone number because we may need to coordinate details.  I will be driving from Somerville and can take 2, I highly suggest 4 wheel drive with decent snow clearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>TBD</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294863301000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294802236000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blue Hills Wednesday afternoon</name><id>16017454</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294858800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak/events/16017454/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/b/f/global_6106799.jpeg</photo_url></item>
