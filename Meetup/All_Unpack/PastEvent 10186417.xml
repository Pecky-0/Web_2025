<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I love this area of the White Mountains. On a nice day, Davis path is one you don't want to come down from. this is a 360 degree view, good weather only hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will hike a loop consisting of Glen Boulder, Boott Spur trail and Tuckerman Ravine trail. We  hike the  Direttissima Trail to complete the loop. In this case the most comfortable Meetup spot would be the Pinkham Notch Information Center&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GLEN BOULDER TRAIL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/5/5/event_5455125.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail ascends past the famous Glen Boulder to the Davis Path below Boott Spur. Parts of it are rather rough, but it reaches the treeline and views relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description  BOOTT SPUR TRAIL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/6/7/event_5444903.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail runs from the Tuckerman Ravine Trail near Pinkham Notch Visitor Center to the Davis Path near the summit of Boott Spur. It follows the long ridge that forms the south wall of Tuckerman Ravine and affords fine views. Grades are mostly moderate, but it has some rough footing. This trail is above treeline and thus greatly exposed to any bad weather for a considerable distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals&lt;br /&gt;Distance  7 mi&lt;br /&gt;Time  7 hr 6 min&lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain  +3682 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss  -3624 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Change  +58 ft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large group will be divided to comply with park rules.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the popularity of this hike, Maybe RSVP's must be decided the Wednesday before the hike. Any remaining Maybe's will be added to the waiting list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every hiker is important on a hike, especially if we divide the hike into a fast and slow group, or if there is an injury. Review the trail maps and itinerary available in the White Mountain Guidebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your assistance on the trail is welcome and needed. We hike as a group, insuring that everyone follows the trail and masters any trail challenge. your hand up is a relief for a tired hiker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If trail or hiker conditions slow the group, you need to understand that the goal for the day can change and we must start back to end the hike safely. This is a loop hike! &lt;b&gt;You must be confident that you are fit to complete the hike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the &lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/283/pages/disclaimer/"&gt;NEHAAG disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hiker profile is complete so we can verify that your qualified to join us on this Strenuous Rated  White Mountain hike.
