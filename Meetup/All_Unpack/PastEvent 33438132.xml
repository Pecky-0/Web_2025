<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Meet other NOBO (north of Boston) Asian families! Julie and Tori are opening their home (with a fenced yard, swingset, ride ons, oh my!) and providing yummy Korean snacks. Feel free to bring other snacks to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This playdate is limited to 6 families (for safe off-street parking). Please DO NOT include your children in your RSVP - instead let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's OK to come later than 10 - Tori naps later in the day. If Friday is not a good day for you, please let us know in the comments section. Julie and Tori can also host on a Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
