<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Fair weather hike with a view! . We can form two pace groups so everyone can hike at a comfortable pace. Diane Mancino's pace is slower than book time, plenty of breaks, save the knees, chill out and enjoy the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrayed in a tight semicircle that stretches for nearly three miles, the Eagle Crag, North Baldface and South Baldface summits provides alpine flowers and stunning views.  Their upper slopes were swept by fire in 1903 and the resulting great expanses of open ledge make the circuit over these peaks one of the finest trips in the Whites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Distance 12.10 mi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Time 8 hr 10 min&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Elev Gain +4202 ft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Elev Loss -4181 ft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Elev Change +21 ft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hike is consider strenuous hike with scrambles over major slabs and long ledges; its rigor should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route: begin Baldface Circle Trail  short detour to Emerald Pool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to Slippery Brook Trail&lt;/p&gt;

Getting There 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These two peaks are located on the eastern edge of the White Mountains, very near New Hampshire's border with Maine and about as far north as Mt Washington.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Directons below are for the Baldface Cirle trailhead.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;From Conway NH, head east on 302/113 to Fryeburg ME, where 113 North takes a sharp left (not well-marked, but if you see the sign for 5/113 South pointing right, backtrack a couple of blocks). Take route 113 (paved but bumpy) north about twenty miles. The small parking lot - plowed in winter- is on the right shortly after a huge brown sign. The trail is a short distance further north on the opposite side of the road. There's a sign, though it's partly obscured by a telephone pole.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Getting to Conway from points south: If traffic is light, you can take rte 16 some 75 miles all the way from Portsmouth NH, which is on Interstate 95. If you prefer to maximize your highway miles, you could take Interstate 93 north, and turn east on your choice of rte 25, 112, or 302.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
