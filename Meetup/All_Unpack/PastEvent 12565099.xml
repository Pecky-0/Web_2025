He entered the canon of modern literature accidentally, as a repentant sketch artist filching time from practicing medicine to jot down stories. Strikingly original from the start, Chekhov had a method to his literary &amp;quot;madness&amp;quot;. In a letter to his less successful-at-writing brother, he offered his recipe for a good story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Absence of lengthy verbiage of a political, social, economic nature&lt;br /&gt;2. Total objectivity&lt;br /&gt;3. Truthful descriptions of persons and objects&lt;br /&gt;4. Extreme brevity&lt;br /&gt;5. Audacity and originality&lt;br /&gt;6. Compassion   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I invite you to judge how he applies this recipe in the following stories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Huntsman&lt;br /&gt;A Boring Story&lt;br /&gt;Ward No. 6&lt;br /&gt;The Lady with the Dog&lt;br /&gt;About Love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the many editions and translations out there, I recommend Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky's.
