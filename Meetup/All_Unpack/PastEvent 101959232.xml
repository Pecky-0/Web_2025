Yet not long ago, it was furrowed by time— overrun by invasive species and suffering from erosion. Come hear Dr. Dave Barnett, President of Mount Auburn, describe the Dell's restoration— requiring decades of work to establish a thriving community of native plants and vital habitat for wildlife. This story is full of lessons about humans and other species, and the significant challenges and rewards of ecological restoration. Dr. Barnett is a respected ecologist and horticulturalist, as well as the President of the Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
