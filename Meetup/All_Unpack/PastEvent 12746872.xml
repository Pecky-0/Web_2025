If you think of it, bring along ideas for our team's name.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early to take advantage of 1/2 price drinks before 7:00pm - most of us order food or share appetizers.  Trivia ends promptly at 9:00, but the lounge is still open for those who want to stay later.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sky Lounge and Bistro is near the Nashua campus of the New Hampshire Community Technical College. &lt;br /&gt;There are two entrances (front and back).  We tend to sit at the tables near the back door, but look for a &amp;quot;MEETUP&amp;quot; sign or Just Ask!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skyloungenh.com/directions.html/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skyloungen...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We tend to sit at the tables near the back door, but look for a "MEETUP" sign or Just Ask!  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth MacKenzie</member_name><member_id>3143060</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296180423000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267474839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Team Trivia at Sky Lounge </name><id>12746872</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271284200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/12746872/</event_url></item>
