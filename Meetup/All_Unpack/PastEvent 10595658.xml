Use this opportunity to practice most common relaxation exercises in a warm, supportive group atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This week we will talk about the use of art for relaxation (visual and literary arts as well as music). Come experience the calming effects of art and creativity. We will do a few simple drawing exercises that are both relaxing and fun. You don't have to be an artist to be able to do them! We will also do a focused listening exercise and talk about other ways of stimulating our imagination through arts.&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a piece of art you particularly like to share it with everybody if you want (A poem or a picture would be great).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $5 &lt;br /&gt;Location: 675 Massachusetts Ave., &lt;br /&gt;11th Floor &lt;br /&gt;Cambridge, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location Info: It is a tall, white/gray building at the corner of Mass Ave and Prospect St., right next to 'Central' (red line) T stop.
