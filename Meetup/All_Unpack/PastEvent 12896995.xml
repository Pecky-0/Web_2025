Many people were interested, so I thought we'd give it a try.  If you're wondering what a sheep shearing festival is, go to this web site: &lt;a href="http://www.goreplace.org/sheepshearing.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goreplace....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides watching the sheep get sheared, you can listen to traditional Scottish music, see kilts get made, watch traditional English dancing, and more.  The is also a large food court and craft fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The festival runs from 10am to 5pm.  We'll meet at 11am, stay for a while and then go somewhere afterwards if anyone is interested.  Admission is $10 and parking is free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is rain or shine.  I will keep an eye on the weather a few days before and make sure the weather won't be too bad.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll send out detail on where to meet closer to the day</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272470672000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268790493000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>23rd annual Sheep Shearing festival</name><id>12896995</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272121200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/12896995/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/1/3/global_13708883.jpeg</photo_url></item>
