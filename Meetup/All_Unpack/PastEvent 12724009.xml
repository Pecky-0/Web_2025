Playing defensively at this level never seems to be a good thing. Anyhow we have scraped and crawled our way to the Gold Medal game, and now it's the coveted  rematch with the US for all the marbles!! This should be a great game, and unlike the last game between us we can expect the American fans at the bar to be a bit more vocal. So wear anything Canadian, bring flags, and any noise makers if you got them (fantastic cow bell Nili!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transit once again is to grab the inbound green line T train to North Station. Walk down to Friend street, and you're there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll need to give the bar a rough count Sunday morning, so make sure you RSVP asap with your numbers. Invite whom ever you want, the more the merrier, especially if they support our boys!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold! Canada!
