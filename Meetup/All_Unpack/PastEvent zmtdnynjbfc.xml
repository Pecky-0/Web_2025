Sorry to those of you who were planning on conspiring to change votes before the deadline.   I just couldn't wait.   Sue me &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The voting was very close this time.   I might recycle these books on our next poll.  As always if your book wasn't selected, stay tuned for future meetings.  In the meantime good luck with Bel Canto!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the end of the month.  I will do my best to finish this time &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the host/hostess</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>mark lufkin</member_name><member_id>9971393</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278015740000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>New Haven 20s &amp; 30s Bibliophiles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>20s-and-30s-Book-Club</urlname><id>1489535</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9199981689</group_lon><name>People in their 20s and 30s Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272804375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>20s and 30s Book Club Monthly Meetup</name><id>zmtdnynjbfc</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277938800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/20s-and-30s-Book-Club/events/13355533/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/9/global_15461353.jpeg</photo_url></item>
