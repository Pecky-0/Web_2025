I'll be there by 9, then plan on heading down whenever Here We Go Magic go on (probably around 10).

The band formed in 2000 with three members from Jonathan Fire*Eater — Paul Maroon (guitar, piano), Walter Martin (organ/bass), and Matt Barrick (drums) — and two from The Recoys, Peter Bauer (bass/organ) and Hamilton Leithauser (vocals, guitar). All but Bauer attended St. Albans in Washington, D.C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They prefer the sound of vintage musical instruments, particularly the upright piano, and have often recorded at Marcata Recording, a recording studio built in Harlem in 1999 by the three former members of Jonathan Fire*Eater and later relocated to upstate New York.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew</member_name><member_id>8828135</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253635606000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250833775000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Walkmen @ The Middle East (downstairs)</name><id>11163898</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253322000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/11163898/</event_url></item>
