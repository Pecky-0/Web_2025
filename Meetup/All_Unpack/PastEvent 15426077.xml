I am not concerned about having a 50:50 ratio of men to women for this special event. Although we have a 50-50 ratio 90% of the time. This dinner is also for all age groups.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fee is $30.00, including a chinese buffet dinner and, plus an open bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invite a friend who is alone and would like to be with positive, optimistic singles, who are appreciative for what we have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun is the operative word. We may play games, cards, whatever you want to suggest. Give me some ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have a warm fire blazing, with hot cider and a cozy, warm safe environment to relax and take our shoes off. Music, TV or just great conversation will be on the agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entry fee: $30&lt;br /&gt;Organizer/Host - Richard Tosti&lt;br /&gt;Location is the warm, loving, supportive and relaxing environment of my home. &lt;br /&gt;Dress is “professional casual” and comfortable. &lt;br /&gt;2:00PM to 6:00PM &lt;br /&gt;Sat.
