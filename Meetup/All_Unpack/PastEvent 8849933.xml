<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>North Pack (2276') is located in Peterborough and Greenfield, NH at the end of the Wapack Trail, which runs from Watatic to North Pack. We will be climbing from the Greenfield side via &lt;a href="http://www.hikenewengland.com/PackMonadnock071103.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ted's Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which makes for a moderate 6-mile and  1400 foot hike at a moderate pace. We will plan to relax and picnic at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailhead is about 45 minutes west of Nashua, NH. A description and directions can be found at &lt;a href="http://nhmountainhiking.com/northpack.html" target="_blank"&gt;nhmountainhiking.com/northpack.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the address listed in the location is approximate, but it should work if you're using mapquest.com google maps or an auto GPS system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't arrange carpools, but you can include whether you're willing to carpool in your RSVP. For those coming from the Nashua area, you could consider &lt;a href="http://www.nh.gov/dot/nhrideshare/p3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Park and Ride Lot 3&lt;/a&gt; off Everett Turnpike Exit 8. Allow for about 45 minutes from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can go visit Yankee Farmer and &lt;a href="http://www.yankeesiege.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yankee Siege Trebuchet&lt;/a&gt; after the hike. You can buy apples or veggies at the farmstand and watch the Yankee Siege shoot pumpkins at a castle for free. You have to see it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; hike, though not &amp;quot;real difficult&amp;quot;, there is some climbing on small rock ledges. Please wear appropriate hiking footwear and be prepared for climbing. Bring water to drink on the trail and a lunch for a picnic at the top. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE&lt;/b&gt; be sure to update your RSVP if your plans change, so that others have a chance to fill your spot. If the trip fills up, post a note that you'd like to join and I can add you if space allows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaders: Jeff and Tessie (the friendly black lab)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for small parking area across from the trailhead</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff</member_name><member_id>2268166</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223389925000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222615195000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike North Pack</name><id>8849933</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223217000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/8849933/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/4/global_5670036.jpeg</photo_url></item>
