A group of legendary Cuban musicians, some as old as their nineties, were brought together by Ry Cooder to record a CD. In this film, we see and hear some of the songs being recorded in Havana. There is also footage from concerts in Amsterdam and New York City's Carnegie Hall. In addition, many of the individual musicians talk about their lives in Cuba and about how they got started in music &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186508/plotsummary" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/t...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film starts at 7:00 in the Life Sciences Building. &lt;br /&gt;For directions to Trinity, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/AboutTrinity/VisitingTrinity/DirectionsToTrinity.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trincoll.e...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or call (860) 297-2053.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/92062DC6-138A-430E-9ADA-5A209B506787/0/campusmap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.trincoll.e...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can come earlier than 6:45, please join me for supper in the Cave cafeteria (basement of Mather Hall, no id required).
