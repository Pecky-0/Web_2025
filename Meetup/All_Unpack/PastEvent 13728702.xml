Never kayaked before? No problem! This is a tranquil paddle for all abilities, so if you've kayaked before, this is a beautiful setting and if you haven't, no big deal! This is an organized trip with guide and equipment provided through the folks at the Kayak Centre in Wickford and all for only $25! Just for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To sign up, please call &lt;a href="http://www.kayakcentre.com" target="_blank"&gt;The Kayak Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Wickford to make your reservation and tell them you're with the Providence Collective to receive the special price for the Sunset Paddle. Do it now, as the deadline is Wednesday, June 23rd! The more people we have the better!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Kayak Center around 6:15. Bring light clothes - pants or shorts, and shoes you don't mind getting wet. Yes, you have to get your feet wet, and getting in and out of the boat a little water inevitably gets on the seat, so you may want to bring a pair of dry shorts to change into afterward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the paddle, we can stay in Wickford and hit the local ice cream stand or see what's available in the way of a bite, or head up the way to the East Greenwich waterfront - we'll see what the group want to do! This is sure to be a fun time - and really, when is it not when we all get together!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let's get out on the water, and let's check out Wickford Harbor at sunset!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the Kayak Centre in Wickford around 6:15pm</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
