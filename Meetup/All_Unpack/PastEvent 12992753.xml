It also has cute little window seats that look fun to sit in and watch people walk by. Its the perfect place for an early spring and potentially rainy evening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be fairly easy to find parking along South Water St. Parkside is on the next block after the Cable Car movie theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a gray and black scarf, but we're not hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
