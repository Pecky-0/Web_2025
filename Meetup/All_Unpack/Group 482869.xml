&lt;p&gt;Here's one members testimonial from our 2009 Nantucket Trip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo; One of the best weekends of this summer. Words can't summarize my experience. Absolutely wonderful people with a great sense of humor. Time just flew by. Thanks, Rob for organizing this event and WE ( I take the liberty of every one that attended here) truly appreciate your time &amp;amp; thoughtfulness. Simply put it we had a BLAST; Thank you again and look forward few more meet ups before the season ends. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizer Rob Fox writes:  "I've participated in so many other biking/fitness groups over the years where it seems like the main goal is to just get to the finish first.  In our group, we are not only out to get a good fitness ride in (average pace 12-15 mph) but I like for people to leave our rides feeling like they just made a bunch of great new friends!   Join us!   We're a fun group and we love cycling!!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you join us, please bring your sense of humor and desire for adventure because, yes it's true,  we even get lost sometimes :-) as we explore new routes together?   It keeps things exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually wrap up the ride with a bite to eat or an ice cream somewhere in the vicinity of the ride's end point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free at anytime to write me with any questions that you have!&lt;/p&gt;
