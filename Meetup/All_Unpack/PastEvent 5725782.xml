Mother Clare is a dynamic speaker, down-to-earth, with great integrity and powerful insights. She is a modern-day mystic, Teacher, national speaker, author, parent, and former homebirth midwife and psychotherapist with Jungian training. She will be giving seminars of topics of inner spirituality on Thursday and Friday nights, and on Saturday morning. I am posting these events in addition to our regular meetups since they may be of interest to some group members. There is an admission fee for these seminars. See below for a description of this day's seminar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday  May 10th   7:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devotion: The Royal Path to God Within&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devotion is an essential part of the spiritual life. When you are devoted to something, you pay close attention, spending time with and pouring your heart into the object of your devotion. This kind of intense, warm, joyful love for God is needed for anyone who seriously wants to expand and deepen their experience of the spiritual life. It is the means for deeper connection. Come to this seminar and learn a deeper way of loving and being loved by God.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
