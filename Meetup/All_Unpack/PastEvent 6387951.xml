All experience levels are welcome. If there is an improv game you are itching to play, including a new form you just thought of--don't be shy--let me know. The purpose of this group is to try things that we might not feel ready to share with an audience. Some things will work some things won't, but I think we will have fun in the process. See you then!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192836696000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190200148000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator Meetup</name><id>6387951</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192663800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/6387951/</event_url></item>
