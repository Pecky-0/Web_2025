You will see how the four temperaments present themselves in each of us, and how you can change to become a better trader (and maybe a better person too).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Personally Brian has been trading and taking investment training courses since 1999.  His background is in voice telecom (telephone systems and networks) and computer and data network support, which he's been working at since 1973.  Brain was introduced to human personalities theory in 1993.&lt;br /&gt;Please take a few minutes before the meeting to do the homework which can be found at these links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/81154/Profiles.pdf"&gt;Homework Part 1 - Profiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/81154/Profile2.pdf"&gt;Homework Part 2 - Profiles2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to bring it with you to the meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Screening Using IBD (TM) Method Criteria led by Jeff Orrik&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff will use screens to discover valuable stock tickers. Some will be from the screens that Mike Kinkead uses in his IBD (TM) Method presentation. Other screens will be used to discover stock tickers that work well with other lists. The goal is to find stocks and ETFs at buy points while experimenting with the tools available on Investors.com and using the various talents of everybody in the room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our members value discussion highly.
