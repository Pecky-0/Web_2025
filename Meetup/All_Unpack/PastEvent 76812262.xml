&lt;p&gt;Elm Bank is a beautiful nature preserve. Three sides of the reservation are surrounded by the Charles River. Thus most of the walk is along itâ€™s scenic banks. There are amazing lush green woods with lots of ferns on one side of the trail and the river with wet meadows on the other side. This portion of the walk is in daylight and only takes about 45 minutes to complete. The meeting location is at Elm Bank parking lot C. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

After enjoying Elm Bank we will do a very short drive and continue our walk near the western entrance of the Brook Path (on Leighton Road at the intersection of Dover Road). The path is paved or well-conditioned dirt and is popular for both pedestrians and bicyclists. It follows Caroline and Fuller Brooks in a quiet area away from major streets. We will spend about an hour enjoying the great scenery and sunset. Flashlights are recommended as it will be starting to get dark towards the end. The summer twilight and different colors of the sky will seem incredible. It will be an amazing late summer walk! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I can pick some people up at the Wellesley Square Commuter Rail before the walk and drop them off at Riverside after. Please email me if you would like a ride. &lt;br /&gt;
