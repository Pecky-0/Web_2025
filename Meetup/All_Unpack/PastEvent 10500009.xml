<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>In case you haven't heard, our Lightning Rounds are geared to the more experienced players who want to learn how to analyze deals faster, navigate around their Financial Statement, and get out of the Rat Race faster.  NO INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE GIVEN at this meetup.  EXPERIENCED PLAYERS ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup particularly will focus on whipping through the Financial Statement--CORRECTLY!!--so that the game can move at a faster pace.  There will be drills before we play the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently the RSVP is limited to six so as to provide efficient training to all attendees.  Also because the location is not conducive to a larger meeting.  So RSVP early!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russ&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the board</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245610996000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243386923000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>LIGHTNING Round of Cashflow</name><id>10500009</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244908800000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/10500009/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
