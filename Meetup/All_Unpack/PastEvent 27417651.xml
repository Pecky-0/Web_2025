  &lt;strong&gt;Eighth Anniversary Meeting!&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Please bring food, drinks, cups, plates or ice! We will use the first hour of the meeting to celebrate the seventh anniversary. We will eat in the lounge area outside Room 315. Use the time to network, pick the brains of your fellow traders and introduce yourself to some of the members you haven't yet met. Please fill out a name tag and wear it. For the "serious" part of the meeting, we will have at least a market talk by Jerry Zukowski and perhaps some other "fun" stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
