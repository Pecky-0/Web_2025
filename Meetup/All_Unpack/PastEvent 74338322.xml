Join us on Tuesdays at 6:00pm at Bird Park located in Walpole for the month of July to learn how to truly enjoy a pack walk. This is a $20 drop in "class on the go" with no commitment needed that will cover various commands, attention games, handling techniques and problem solving solutions. All breeds, obedience levels and reactive dogs are welcome. We will be meeting at the corner of Washington Street and Rhodes Ave across from Saint Mary's Church. The trainer, Barbara Jean, can be reached at 508-406-8881 or at rsa-901@hotmail.com with any questions or concerns, advanced notice of attendance is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343412557000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342908712000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walpole Structured Strides</name><id>74338322</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1343404800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/74338322/</event_url></item>
