Get there early for a good seat! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temple Sinai in Brookline welcomes the community to its annual Purim Shpiel on Saturday, March 14th at 7:30 pm – and you can come in costume! This is a theatrical art form celebrating the amateur and the good-natured above the talented - although our congregation has a lot of hidden talent! The shpiel is performed in the Temple Sanctuary every year in celebration of Purim, an important Jewish holiday that not only honors freedom, but extols the ability to joke in the face of adversity. (“Shpiel” is Yiddish for “play”.)  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Temple Sinai is located at 50 Sewall Avenue, in Coolidge Corner. We warmly invite the public to join us for lots of fun – come in costume, and come ready to chime in – we provide the noisemakers! All are welcome!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is a suggested donation of $5. and there is a gala oneg after the show!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ellen</member_name><member_id>4148667</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237245171000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>425314</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Jewish Singles 55+  of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234135954000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Purim Shpiel at Temple Sinai Brookline</name><id>9701424</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237071600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston/events/9701424/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/c/9/global_7630297.jpeg</photo_url></item>
