The Doc expects many of you plan to join in on the big day's festivities... but you are in desperate need of some practice beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help you prepare for the hardship you'll endure on St. Patrick's Day, the Doc will hold a Practice run to help get everyone into shape this Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The practice &amp;quot;stations&amp;quot; will all be in the downcity area of Providence.  But since the Doc does not know how many people are willing to put in the time and effort of such a difficult practice ... He cannot choose the appropriate practice stations yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, based on how many people sign up, on Friday the Doc will post the list of stations that will be visited throughout the St. Paddy's Day practice on Sat March 13th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please sign up before Friday so the Doc has an accurate count.  Go raibh maith agaibh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember... Practice makes Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sláinte chugat&lt;br /&gt;-Doc&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Doc wears his sunglasses at nite</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doc LateNite</member_name><member_id>9585499</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268786184000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268199151000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>St. Paddy's Day Practice Run</name><id>12836529</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268521200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/12836529/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/3/global_13569747.jpeg</photo_url></item>
