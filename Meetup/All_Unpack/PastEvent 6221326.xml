Based on the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a young British army officer whose recon mission in the Arabian desert turns into an all-out heroic struggle to unite the scattered, warring desert tribes against the encroaching Turkish forces during WWI. LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is an expertly crafted portrait of clashing cultures, and of a man driven to the brink of madness by conflicting loyalties and his own unquenchable ambition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater. After the film, we'll head off to lunch at local taqueria Boca Grande.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188991769000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187741903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Big Screen Classics: Lawrence of Arabia at Coolidge</name><id>6221326</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188745200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6221326/</event_url></item>
