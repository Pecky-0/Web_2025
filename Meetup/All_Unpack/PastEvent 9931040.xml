Don't forget that there's our Atheist Social at Orleans at the same time!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Lobdell became a born-again Christian in his late 20s when personal problems—including a failed marriage—drove him to his knees in prayer. As a newly minted evangelical, Lobdell—a veteran journalist—noticed that religion wasn't covered well in the mainstream media, and he prayed for the Lord to put him on the religion beat at a major newspaper. In 1998, his prayers were answered when the Los Angeles Times asked him to write about faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet what happened over the next eight years was a roller-coaster of inspiration, confusion, doubt, and soul-searching as his investigative reporting and experiences slowly chipped away at his faith. As this evidence piled up, he started to fear that God didn't exist. He explored every doubt, every question—until, finally, his faith collapsed. After the paper agreed to reassign him, he wrote a personal essay in the summer of 2007 that became an international sensation for its honest exploration of doubt. And though he was perhaps the world’s most reluctant atheist, his post-God life brought him something unexpected: peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About William Lobdell:&lt;br /&gt;William Lobdell, 48, is the author of the critically acclaimed memoir, “Losing My Religion: How I Lost My Faith Reporting on Religion in America — and Found Unexpected Peace” published by HarperCollins. The book has garnered glowing reviews and endorsements from such disparate people as atheist Christopher Hitchens and Skeptics Society founder Michael Shermer, and a variety of well-known Pentecostal and evangelical pastors and Christian talk radio hosts. Lobdell started on the religion beat at the Los Angeles Times in 1998 as an evangelical Christian and left it, eight years later, a reluctant atheist. He earned several national awards for his work before leaving the beat in 2006. Lobdell also has been a visiting faculty member for 12 years at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Boston Skeptics:&lt;br /&gt;Boston Skeptics is a group of critical thinkers who get together to talk, eat, drink, and be skeptical about things like homeopathy, creationism, psychics, aliens, alternative medicine, conspiracy theories, and whatever else catches our attention.
