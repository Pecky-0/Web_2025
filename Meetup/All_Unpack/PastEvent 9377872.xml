Hopefully, Tom gets there early so that he can show us where we are allowed to set up.  Please add comments this week telling the organizer(s) what you thought about having game night at Killarney's.  Did you like it, hate it, don't care?  Do you think this venue will work in the future?&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign.
