&lt;p&gt;This is an impressive event with many spectators and it will be televised. Please understand what an important outreach opportunity this is for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a great showing this year at the Memorial Day parade with a terrific float and 18 Rhode Island Oath Keepers marching and standing tall. I know that this one can be even bigger and better. So,what do you say? Who is ready to spend a terrific and exhilarating fall afternoon with friends spreading the good news message of "Oath Keepers"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rhode Island Oath Keepers will be Unit: 8 in Division: 9 and will be staging at Narragansett Ave at 12:30 p.m. Sunday, October 7th. (Rain date October 8th)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still looking for more veterans to ride in a place of honor on the float like last time. (Preferably in uniform or Oath Keepers gear) also a drum, Fife or bagpipes would be nice, do you have any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count off below: (Let's ROLL!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

We will be marching with:&lt;/p&gt;
