<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite beach walks and since I missed it in January, I am offering a second chance to do it in the early spring.There is something beautiful about the beach and ocean in the early spring.The sand dunes are a great hike and yes we are allowed on them! $7 fee per car to get in.We hike for about 2 hours and then head to out for food and drinks after at the Ipswich Sports Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to wear&lt;/strong&gt; - WARM clothes. Ski jacket or windbreaker. Ski pants are good or something lined. It is VERY windy, so dress accordingly. Definitely recommend a hat, &lt;br /&gt;

 scarf, gloves, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For feet - sneakers are fine, but recommend winter boots or hiking boots.I also recommend thick hiking socks with boots/sneakers, which can be find in REI or even Target. Important to keep your feet dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a backpack for water, trail mix, even advil if the spring allergies are out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start promptly at 12:30. There will be three different hikes of varying distances. We will all finish hiking by 2:30 pm and head over the Ipswich Sports Bar, which is located at 24 Hammatt St in the center of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARPOOLING:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage carpooling especially if groups of friends will be going. It also saves on the entrance fees. Please make these plans among yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow/Rain cancels this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking lot at the entrance to the dunes.
