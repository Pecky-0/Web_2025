PLEASE NOTE THE TIME CHANGE TO 8PM FOR DINNER.  If you wish to get there between 7 and 8 and hang at the bar you may.  But the official start time is now 8pm. We are back for another funfilled and festive night at Lavender!  Dinner and watch the Bruins take on the Islanders on the home ice at 7.  Celtics play at the Bulls at 8.  Karaoke at 9.  Sing or just hang with us!  Everyone pays their own way.  If arriving later than 7, then please indicate what time in your RSVP so we can save you a spot at our table.  Kitchen stays open late for those who enjoy the late evening munchies :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260904138000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Funseeker</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>nefunseekers</urlname><id>1277691</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>Funseekers!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257290708000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Holidays!
