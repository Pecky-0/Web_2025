Trivia starts at 7:00pm. We will meet at 6:30pm to get a spot or two, or three. Join us for drinks, food and a fun time playing team trivia. Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink. Please don't hesitate to walk up to me and claim your spot on our (usually) award winning team(s) !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a special note, this venue strictly enforces the 6 team member limits (the # of teams is how the Stumpd people are paid).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Patrick, who is hard to miss...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick</member_name><member_id>3019129</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326295476000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>metrowestyoungprofessionals</urlname><id>951974</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>Metro West Young Professionals Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325692152000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stumpd Team Trivia at J.J's Sports Bar and Grill in Northborough</name><id>46616252</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326238200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/metrowestyoungprofessionals/events/46616252/</event_url></item>
