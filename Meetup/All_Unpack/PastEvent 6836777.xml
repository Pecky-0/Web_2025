<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>One of our members, Pam, has graciously offered her home and fenced-in yard for our January Meetup.  Pam is not available on the first Saturday, so this month's Meetup is on the second Saturday.  The dogs are welcome to play in or out, as Pam's house is puppy proof.  Pam says she will have coffee cake, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate for everyone.  And plenty of dog treats too.   &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like directions, please email me and I will send them to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;Laura &amp;amp; Molly&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200351810000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196528936000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel January Meetup</name><id>6836777</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200153600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/6836777/</event_url></item>
