Here's a good favorite. Bring another member along, let's fill up some planes and go! Wednesday night fly outs are the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marshfield is one of the prettiest airports we have visited, with seacoast views, sunsets and warm hospitality from the folks at Shoreline Aviation.  The Fairview Inn is our top choice for oceanview dining and good food.  The  threat of fog and thunderstorms kept us away a few weeks ago, but we want to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come along with us and see more of lovely New England sunsets.  Our weather can provide some challenges, but we do live in a beautiful area of the country.  Flying over it is one of the best ways to view it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the helpful Boston controllers haen't heard from us for a while - we need to check in with them more often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the menu and other details here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thefairviewinn.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Fairview Inn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287707861000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286802170000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another try to Marshfield and Serene Seacost Dining</name><id>15070299</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287610200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/15070299/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/6/global_5143542.jpeg</photo_url></item>
