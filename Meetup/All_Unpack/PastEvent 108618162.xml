&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that those dancing shoes have been getting a work out lately.... so why should they rest now.  Quick get them on and head down to Supino's to dance the night away to an awesome band with some great friends!  We look forward to seeing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
