We are excited to announce our January event at the absolutely delightful &lt;a href="http://www.olliesdownunder.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Ollie's Down Under Bar &amp;amp; Grill&lt;/a&gt; on the main street of Shelburne Falls. Some of you may remember that in a slightly different incarnation, the place was called the Tusk &amp;amp; Rattle. Risen from the ashes a few years ago, Margaret Fitzpatrick, our host and owner, opened Ollie's (named after her dog). One Chowhounder called it, &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;the best incarnation of that space yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris and I went there on a scouting mission a few weeks ago and we were impressed with the menu and the drink selection (VERY creative!) and the service and the atmosphere. We tried the curried coconut mussels and they were delicious. I still am dreaming about the lamb burger I didn't have, I guess I'll have to go back to make sure the place is really good enough for my foodies!  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some reviews from around the 'net:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2009/07/restaurant_review_ollies_downu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mass Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/ollies-downunder-bar-and-grille-shelburne-falls" target="_blank"&gt;Yelp!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=ollie%27s+down+under+reviews&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;hq=ollie%27s+down+under&amp;amp;hnear=Deerfield,+MA&amp;amp;cid=17947533496380415154&amp;amp;dtab=2&amp;amp;ei=28IqS9C_LtTS8QajstSaBw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;ved=0CBcQqgUwAw" target="_blank"&gt; Google Maps Reviews&lt;/a&gt; (didn't know they did that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...because of the exciting new crowd of folks who have joined our ranks over the last few months, we are going to be doing things a bit differently now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting in 2010, (don't you just love that!) we are going to be taking the entire fee up front and paying the restaurant when we get there. Of course, any beverages will be paid for individually, but now, once paid, your registration fee, appetizer, soup or salad, entree, dessert, TAX AND GRATUITY (on dinner, not the drinks) will be all paid for. How cool is that?! For this event, the fee is $35.00! Such a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...ladies and gentlemen, start your engines NOW, the registration is open for our January event. If for any reason you cannot pay by PayPal, please call me right away at 413-628-1640 and I will manually enter you and you will have three days to send a check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we'll be the ones with the biggest warmest smiles on our faces!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>9683028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264372720000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>food lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Western-Mass-Eat-Up</urlname><id>1464899</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western Mass Eat-Up!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260978894000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Fabulous Ollie's Down Under in Shelburne Falls</name><id>12096738</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263771000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Western-Mass-Eat-Up/events/12096738/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/a/global_12270778.jpeg</photo_url></item>
