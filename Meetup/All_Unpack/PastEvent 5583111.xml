Here is a synopsis of the lecture that Chris will be leading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The web has proliferated at an unprecedented rate since its founding in the early 90?s. Since that period, the web has progressed from a simple network of servers housing static content into a global network that supports highly complex e-commerce interactions. Today the buzzward is web 2.0, but the opportunity for the future, as articulated by Tim Burners-Lee himself, lies in the so-called ?Semantic Web?. Let?s use this discussion forum to first understand what the world of the ?Semantic Web? will look like. Next, lets identify and understand the key technologies that will support this new world. Technologies such as RDF, OWL, SPARQL and a more semantic RSS will become important. Lets talk at a high-level what these technologies can accomplish , with an eye toward its applicability to solving real world problems.  Finally lets spend some time identifying some actual problems that help in this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brunswick</member_name><member_id>1794538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175224331000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Technology Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>web-8</urlname><id>215777</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Computing Review Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174279568000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Exploring the Semantic Web</name><id>5583111</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174849200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/web-8/events/5583111/</event_url></item>
