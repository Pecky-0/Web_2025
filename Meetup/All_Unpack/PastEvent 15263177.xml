It is for about 25 - 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think that it has a restaurant in it but we can definitely get dinner somewhere around there. I can find something but I am certainly open to suggestions - just throw 'em out! :-) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I am also open to suggestions on the time. I figure if we get there at 6pm, get all laser-ed up at 6:15pm - play till 6:45pm, get out of there by 7pm and off to dinner and drinks we go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295234021000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288302187000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Laser tag!</name><id>15263177</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295132400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/15263177/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/c/global_11514924.jpeg</photo_url></item>
