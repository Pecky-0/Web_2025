They handle letting people in to the bottom theaters differently every time I see a film there.  I will be by the ropes waiting to be let in to wait in line inside, if they set it up that way.  Once they let people in, I will wait in line until they open the door for seats, probably around 6:45, &lt;b&gt;actual showtime is 7:15.&lt;/b&gt;  It is opening night so you might want to buy a ticket in advance.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahhh this movie will be filled with bad one liners and lots of explosions....a fun romp to be sure, just remember to suspend your disbelief going into the theater.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a meetup pin and will also have a meetup sign. If the movie is showing upstairs, I will try to grab a table by the windows at the top of the escalator. If it is showing downstairs, I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, any who are interested can join me in going to a nearby establishment for drinks, munchies and lively conversation. I am thinking of taking the group to Vapiano on Stuart Street this week.   We meet outside the room where the movie has just been shown to discuss the movie a bit, allow for restroom breaks and get a head count of all those heading to the after movie activity.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Date: January 28, 2011  &lt;br /&gt;Studio: CBS Films  &lt;br /&gt;Director: Simon West  &lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Richard Wenk, Lewis John Carlino  &lt;br /&gt;Starring: Jason Statham, Ben Foster, Donald Sutherland, Christa Campbell  &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Action, Thriller  &lt;br /&gt;MPAA Rating: R (for strong brutal violence throughout, language, some sexual content and nudity)  &lt;br /&gt;Official Website:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://themechanicmovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://themechanicmov...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot Summary: Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a 'mechanic' - an elite assassin with a strict code and unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets. It's a job that requires professional perfection and total detachment, and Bishop is the best in the business. But when his mentor and close friend Harry (Donald Sutherland) is murdered, Bishop is anything but detached. His next assignment is self-imposed - he wants those responsible dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His mission grows complicated when Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster) approaches him with the same vengeful goal and a determination to learn Bishop's trade. Bishop has always acted alone but he can't turn his back on Harry's son. A methodical hit man takes an impulsive student deep into his world and a deadly partnership is born. But while in pursuit of their ultimate mark, deceptions threaten to surface and those hired to fix problems become problems themselves. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a meetup pin and will also have a meetup sign.
