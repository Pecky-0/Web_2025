She's looking into getting a couple of rooms through Priceline so you'll need to be certain that you're coming if you RSVP yes.  It looks like $35-$40 per room, for a two person room.  Pam will keep us updated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we'll end up with two groups, those going down Friday night and those going Saturday morning so don't feel like you have to go on Friday if you'd rather not.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh boy WEBS!!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steph</member_name><member_id>4872811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252278101000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1207309738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hotel in North Hampton for early Webs Shopping</name><id>7671585</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210977000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/7671585/</event_url></item>
