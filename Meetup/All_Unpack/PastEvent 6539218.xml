Raven and Edward O. Wilson (for details on the speakers, see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i (Ben) will try to be there by 5:15. if you're lost, give me a call at 203-554-5144. but don't bother trying to call me once the program has started, because i won't answer my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;admission is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this could be depressing, so drinks someplace nearby afterward are a definite possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Botanist Peter H. Raven is a world-renowned conservationist and expert on the rain forest whom Time magazine declared a &amp;quot;Hero of the Planet&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;doing extraordinary things to preserve and protect the environment.&amp;quot; He is currently the Engelmann Professor of Botany at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Dr. Raven also serves as director of the Missouri Botanical Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward O. Wilson, the world's leading authority on ants, is a pioneering environmentalist who has discovered hundreds of new species, won two Pulitzer Prizes, and worked tirelessly to educate the public about the ecological consequences of human behavior. One of the world's greatest living scientists, he is often called &amp;quot;the father of biodiversity.&amp;quot; He is currently Professor Emeritus of Biology at Harvard University and Honorary Curator in Entomology at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542372000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192227010000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weds. 10/17 - "The Future of Life on Earth"</name><id>6539218</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192656600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/6539218/</event_url></item>
