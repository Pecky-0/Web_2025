Just in case you need more information about the movie, you can find it at&amp;nbsp;IMDB:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/"&gt;http://www.imdb.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be waiting in the theater lobby from 6:30&amp;nbsp;to 6:45 p.m. I'm told my bright red backpack makes for a great landmark, so look for it and me in the lobby! The movie doesn't start until 7 p.m., but I will head into the theater about 6:45 because I want to see the previews. If you're late, you can find me after the movie: I'll be the one reading the credits at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the movie, we can head to the Algiers Coffee House, if anyone is interested in joining me for some of their fantastic mint hot chocolate. The Algiers Coffee House is at 40 Brattle Street in Harvard Square.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wait in the theater lobby near the concession stand from 6:30 p.m. to 6:45 p.m. Look for my bright red backpack.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300227172000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>It's an Oscar winner and I still haven't seen it!</why><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299800431000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Fighter in Harvard Square</name><id>16877643</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300141800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/16877643/</event_url></item>
