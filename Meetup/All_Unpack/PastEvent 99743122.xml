They took on the karma accumulated by humanity over hundreds of years and paved a path of forgiveness through love and sacrifice. They taught us a way through the demonstration of their very lives, transforming the feminine and masculine essence of our humanity. During this seminar, led by Mother Clare Watts, Christian Master Teacher, author and peace activist, you will come to a new understanding of who Jesus and Mary are, what  their role, as mediators, in this New Era is and why getting to know them will lighten up your life. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Come! Open your heart and mind and be surprised at what you see &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
