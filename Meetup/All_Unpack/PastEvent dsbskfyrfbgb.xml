Whether you're a new or experienced climber, join us for a fun and solid workout! We usually have people at all levels. Gym meetups are also a great way to make more friends for outdoor climbing. If you'd like to lead climb, don't forget to bring your rope :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** If you are new to MetroRock Gym and/or climbing, please see the FAQ below. ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet at the picnic tables near bouldering area (the one furthest from the cubbies if available) from 7 - 7:10 PM.  (NOTE: In the rare case the Event Host doesn't arrive within this time window, assume major traffic jam or other catastrophy, ask others nearby to find the group, make introductions, and go climb). If arriving later, just come find us on the walls.  Hopefully you can recognize us, the event Host(s) (see RSVP list) from our profile pictures, and/or check the small Whiteboard near the bathrooms and water fountain, for a description of what we're wearing that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If interested in starting earlier, or you have any special requests, feel free to post a heads up in your RSVP or a message on this event page. Some sort of face/head picture in your profile helps us recognize you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-access Day Pass $18. Bouldering-Only Pass $15.  Mondays are Women's Discount Day: Women's Pass $10; also special class pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions for Newbies&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q)&lt;/strong&gt; How do I get to the gym?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A)&lt;/strong&gt; See website for directions: &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/"&gt;http://www.metrorock.com/&lt;/a&gt; If you're driving here for the first time, it can be tricky to find MetroRock Everett, especially in the dark! Use a GPS if possible. MetroRock is in a building opposite Boston Coach.   If you don't have a vehicle, the gym offers a shuttle service from nearby Wellington T Station; call them for schedule details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q)&lt;/strong&gt; I've never climbed at MetroRock Gym before, what do I need to do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A)&lt;/strong&gt; You'll need to take and pass a belay test for rope climbing. There is a separate test for toproping and sport lead climbing. For toproping, if you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. They will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock in advance to reserve your spot in the class, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering. Also, you can rent basic climbing gear (harness, shoes, belay device, etc), if needed, at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At the picnic tables near bouldering area (the one furthest from cubbies if available)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Y</member_name><member_id>12283796</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Trotter</member_name><member_id>28468392</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362496695000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360965261000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MetroRock Monday</name><id>dsbskfyrfbgb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362441600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/105768372/</event_url></item>
