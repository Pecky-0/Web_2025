This gives everyone an opportunity to come and practice their Japanese or English with a bunch of motivated people.  So, if you're itching to use that new Japanese slang or can't figure out all those crazy English grammar rules, here's a great place for some language practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The format of our meetings goes as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-5 PM - First Group: Self-introduction/Free Conversation/Study/Etc&lt;br /&gt;-- change groups --&lt;br /&gt;5-6 PM - Second Group: Self-introduction/Free Conversation/Study/Etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, we typically stay in the very back of the Prudential Food Court and should have little signs that say &amp;quot;meetup.com&amp;quot; for table markers.  We look forward to seeing all of you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert Schuman</member_name><member_id>2969623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179777684000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179323131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Prudential Academic Meetup</name><id>5784022</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179604800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/5784022/</event_url></item>
