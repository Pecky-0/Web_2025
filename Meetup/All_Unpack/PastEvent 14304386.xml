I've reserved a few camp sites for Friday night.  I've reserved some canoes for us as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing:&lt;br /&gt;The cost for the weekend is $65 which includes a canoe for 2 days, transportation fee for the canoe and the campsite on Friday night (we camp along the river on Saturday night).  It does not include parking.  I need a $25 deposit from everyone to hold the canoes and campsites.  I will forward paypal information once you've RSVP'd (everyone will initially be put on the waitlist until payment is squared away).  I will hold the canoes until the end of the day on August 6th.  If I haven't received a deposit from anyone I'll need to release the canoe(s) as that's the cutoff for a refund.  However, we can still reserve more canoes if they are available after that point.  Also, parking at Swans Falls is $8 so carpooling is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplies (What we'll need - please use the poll to list anything you're bringing so we don't have too much of any one item):&lt;br /&gt;Tents (I have one, but we'll need more than that)&lt;br /&gt;Firewood&lt;br /&gt;Coolers&lt;br /&gt;Food (burgers/dogs/chicken/snacks/fruit etc)&lt;br /&gt;Beverages (water/alcholic/non alcoholic)&lt;br /&gt;Toys (both beach and water)&lt;br /&gt;Bug spray&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping bags (if you don't have one let me know)&lt;br /&gt;Coleman Grill (I have this)&lt;br /&gt;Toilet Paper&lt;br /&gt;Condiments&lt;br /&gt;Paper plates&lt;br /&gt;Plastic Utensils&lt;br /&gt;Music (I have this)&lt;br /&gt;Garbage bags (I have these)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm planning on heading up a little early on the 13th.
