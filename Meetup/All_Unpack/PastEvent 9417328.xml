<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The first 2 murder mysteries went beyond fantastic. &lt;br /&gt;We had so much fun, we thought we'd do it again. &lt;br /&gt;Our next gala is sure to out do the last. &lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to rsvp early as we have limited characters available. &lt;br /&gt;You cannot rsvp maybe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So put on your crazy outfits and step out of reality for a while &lt;br /&gt;and let go of your worries. &lt;br /&gt;There will be prizes awarded for best costume, best sleuth, best actor/actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event costs $25. &lt;br /&gt;Please contact Lori Larsen for payment, reservations and further details. &lt;br /&gt;Go to either our member site to Lori's e-mail or call (203) 933-2200 &lt;br /&gt;Regarding this event&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being from West Haven, I am aware of the parking &lt;br /&gt;Problems on Campbell Avenue. &lt;br /&gt;I am also aware of parking areas &lt;br /&gt;That others might not be aware of or use. &lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, I use the large parking area that is behind &lt;br /&gt;Loris store. I was using that parking area over a decade ago &lt;br /&gt;Long before Lori even moved into that store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Campbell Avenue, turn into the side street &lt;br /&gt;Of Curtis Place next to &lt;br /&gt;Marc Anthony's Pizza Italian Restaurant &lt;br /&gt;(Restaurant has had a few different names over the years &lt;br /&gt;But this is its latest name.). &lt;br /&gt;There is a large parking area behind there. &lt;br /&gt;Going to Campbell Avenue, you can walk over towards &lt;br /&gt;Marc Anthony's. &lt;br /&gt;Then turn right on Campbell Avenue to Lori's store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walk over toward the right from the parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;There is an alley between the buildings. &lt;br /&gt;On Campbell Avenue, &lt;br /&gt;I turn left. Lori's store is a few stores in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a fun Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lookatmenow22.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.lookatmeno...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.lookatmenow22.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.catchahealthyhabit.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.catchaheal...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.catchahealthyhabit.com/&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lori Larsen is POC.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235434054000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230784460000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coffee Talk Attends Feb.
