<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello everyone. I want to introduce myself to you, my name is Reverend Gabrielle. I am a non- denominational mystical Christian priest. I have been meditating for over 14 years and taught yoga for a long time too. I am eager to meet others who are interested in meditation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not be a Christian-based group but it will focus on learning skills to concentrate and relax so a connection can be made inside through quieting the mind to settle into the deeper place where the true Self lives.  Mysticism just means knowing through experience; what better way to experience God inside than through meditation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to invite you all to come together on August 30th at 7pm for a Meditation and Mystical tea. This is what it will look like: We will start with a visualization or a short reading or subject to contemplate (we can come together to discuss also what kinds of subjects the group is interested in), then after the meditation, we will discuss our experiences and talk about ways to deepen our practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting you all and will be happy to see you there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes,  tea will be served too :)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Light, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;ps - Feel free to call me at 617.852.2822!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1157763988000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1156283158000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meditation &amp; Mystical Tea Monthly Meet-Up</name><id>5091402</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156978800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/5091402/</event_url></item>
