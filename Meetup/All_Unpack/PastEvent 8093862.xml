He also shows what their performance has been. The focus will be on ETFs and stocks for asset classes, sectors, industry groups and indexes. In particular, we will be looking to hear from you to find out what you have surmised and found a way to trade on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Screening Using IBD (TM) Method Criteria led by Jeff Orrik&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff will use screens to discover valuable stock tickers. Some will be from the screens that Mike Kinkead uses in his IBD (TM) Method presentation. Other screens will be used to discover stock tickers that work well with other lists. The goal is to find stocks and ETFs at buy points while experimenting with the tools available on Investors.com and using the various talents of everybody in the room. Jeff will weave Blocks into his analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harlan Will &lt;u&gt;Not&lt;/u&gt; Be Presenting His Market Update&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ming will fill in for this meeting.

Then we solicit all the picks from everyone and run through all them, with Jeff putting up the charts as we have done in the past. Afterwards we will focus on 5 of the stocks to be analyzed further and dissected by the group at large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Day Trader's Pre-Meeting led by Eric Eklof&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Premeeting is 5:30 to 6:50 &amp;amp; arrive when you can.
