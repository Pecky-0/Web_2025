The topic is exactly the topic of the previous  physical meeting (continued). This is a good opportunity to carry on the  discussion with newer ideas, a nice venue for couple of out of townees  to enable them to participate. To join the e-mail list of the  participants of the skype chats please send an e-mail with your skype id  and e-mail address to the organizer. You will receive the e-mails  circulated amongst skype chat participants and after that all you have  to do is to be on skype at the time of the meetings and the organizer  will call you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299899187000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299465359000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skype chat</name><id>16824980</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299805200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/16824980/</event_url></item>
