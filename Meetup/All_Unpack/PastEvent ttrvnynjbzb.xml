(If there is rain, I will send a cancellation notice by 7:30 Sat. morning.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven't been, Dugger Park (five courts) is not far from the Tufts courts and you can Google Map the address above for directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If attending, please RSVP so we can get a rough idea of how many courts we'll need.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  We haven't had to deal with this much due to ample court space so far but, if I have to break any ties as to who plays and who waits, an RSVP will go a long way towards playing. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't know your &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://tennis.meetup.com/240/messages/boards/thread/9032528"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do have an idea of your level though, please list it when you RSVP as it'll help us group players of similar levels on courts.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask, 'Are you with the Meetup?' and look for a guy w/ glasses and a right knee brace.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave M.</member_name><member_id>7526742</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277131672000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Tennis Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>tennis-240</urlname><id>432728</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Somerville Tennis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276707973000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis Saturday Morning at Dugger Park - Medford</name><id>ttrvnynjbzb</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276948800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tennis-240/events/13820408/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/c/global_14999340.jpeg</photo_url></item>
