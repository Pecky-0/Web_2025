This time, I'd like to ask each of you to bring in 20 trivia questions to stump the group.  We played Trivia last week in Dedham and our Trivia Queen,  &lt;b&gt;Maureen&lt;/b&gt;, stole the show.  Please join us as we &amp;quot;remember together&amp;quot; lost and little known facts about Frankie Valle, Lost In Space, and Peter Paul and Mary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chef Tom Cutrone opened Savinos in early April in Belmontâ€™s Cushing Square. The decor is warm shades of the Tuscan country side with an edge of upscale city design to compliment the dining experience. Savinos cuisine features creative seasonal pairings of fresh, local and imported foods. The contemporary menu highlights the foods of Italy and the surrounding Mediterranean regions. The wine list enhances the menu with European wines as well as domestic selections. The restaurant also hosts dinners with wine speakers for an informative and enjoyable dining experience.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservations under Boston Baby Boomers</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7792036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256596501000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255034385000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia and Dinner at Savino's in Belmont</name><id>11583145</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256423400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/11583145/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/8/global_7119160.jpeg</photo_url></item>
