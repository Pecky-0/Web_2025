We're headed to Jacob Wirth's for a Sing-Along for Justice with pianist Mel Stiller.  It's been a Boston tradition since 1988, so be sure to join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emphasis is on rock/oldies from the 50's, 60's, and 70's, with plenty of show tunes and standards, too. Stop by and see why so many people have said that Friday night at Jake's is the most fun they've had in Boston.  Of course, there are also all kinds of domestic and imported beers on draft, and the Jacob Wirth dinner menu to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So look no further if you're seeking like-minded folks to sing show tunes with, want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while you belt out old standards, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in. If you want to build a strong cross-issue social justice movement, SoJust is for you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to connect outside of SoJust events? Members can view and post events, job &amp;amp; volunteer announcements, roommate searches, etc. on the 'Message Board' and are encouraged to suggest and co-host events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wanna know more about SoJust?&lt;/b&gt; Check out our &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3187615"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/photos/"&gt;Event Photos&lt;/a&gt;.
