This meetup is for you. We have an EVP expert who generously offered to give a lecture on EVPs and to share some of his EVPs with us.&lt;br /&gt;His name is Haydon Hall and he run sa team out in Connecticut&lt;br /&gt;called NEAPRI. During the dark cold months of winter when few&lt;br /&gt;investigations are pursued because of raging furnaces making&lt;br /&gt;audio close to an impossibility, he frequently lectures using a&lt;br /&gt;DLP and a PowerPoint presentation on EVP and other audio anomalies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His lecture lasts 90 minutes and covers the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History&lt;br /&gt;Equipment Used (Analog &amp;amp; Digital)&lt;br /&gt;Capturing Methods&lt;br /&gt;Enhancements Disk&lt;br /&gt;Recording Methods &amp;amp; Procedures&lt;br /&gt;Classifications &amp;amp; Examples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was trained by Todd Bates of Haunted Voices as an EVP&lt;br /&gt;Specialist using Adobe Audition software in amplification,&lt;br /&gt;filtering, restoration and analysis. I've also asked him to demo&lt;br /&gt;Audacity, a free audio editing program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following his lecture, we'll have pizza. Please feel free to bring EVPs &lt;br /&gt;that you've captured so that we can share our evidence.
