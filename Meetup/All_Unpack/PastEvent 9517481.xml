It is a shining saga of good and evil, treachery and intrigue, violence and beauty. Not-so-noble knights, righteous heroes, valiant heroines and both virtuous and immoral men of God highlight this story. They manipulate, and are in turn manipulated by, the political turmoil and unrest between the reigns of Henry I and Henry II.  The listener will cheer on the fates of the virtuous and hiss at the evil-doers. A truly fascinating story that the listener will never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already read this book and it is one of my all time favorites and I was very happy when it was selected.  The book revolves around the building of a giant cathedral and you will love every word of the tale.  I must warn you that it is very long.
