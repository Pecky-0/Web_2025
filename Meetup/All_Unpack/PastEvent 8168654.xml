This quietly compelling drama of fractured families, dislocated cultures and bridged gulfs is masterfully written and directed by Turkish-German Fatih Akin (Head-On, Crossing the Bridge). Expatriate widower Ali (Tuncel Kurtiz), seeking a little home comfort, invites prostitute Yeten (Nursel KÃ¶se) to live with him, a move his son Nejat (Baki Davrak), a professor of German literature, disparages. When tragedy ensues, Nejat travels to Turkey seeking Yeten's daughter while she, unknowing, searches for her mother in Germany. Kendall description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Edge of Heaven&lt;/b&gt; is a film to be seen, savored and thoughtfully appreciated. NY Observer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Edge of Heaven&lt;/b&gt; is about something more exasperating than crossed paths; it is about paths that almost cross but don?t, and the tragedy of the near-miss. New Yorker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a beautiful, unexpectedly enrapturing story about a world in transition and both the closeness and unbridgeable divide between generations and cultures.  L.A.
