As always, we'll throw in some fun tricks, a great way to get nay-sayers to warm up to your bully! ~~~ Requirements for this class: a 4-6 foot leather or nylone leash (NO flexi/extendable leashes - if you bring one, you will be rented a fixed lead for $5); a supply of bite-sized, SUPER high value training treats (cheese, hot dog, real meat); a hungry dog (probably skip breakfast) and a confident attitude! ~~~ Cost will be $15. ~~~ No overly dog/human aggressive dogs at this class: if that is an issue you are working on, contact myself at justcassie101@gmail.com or Barbara Jean Crehan at rsa-901@hotmail.com. We are happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassie-Leigh Stock</member_name><member_id>8663419</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333270959000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330363920000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CGC/Better Breed Ambassadors Drop-In Classes Resume!</name><id>qpscncyqfbpc</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333209600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/54027622/</event_url></item>
