Learn the basics of making bread using a sourdough culture and how to keep that culture growing for years. This will be a three hour meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting around 1:00 we will shape bread dough into loaves.&lt;br /&gt;While the dough is rising you will learn the stages of building the dough and how to maintain your sourdough culture. At about 2:30 the bread will be ready to bake.&lt;br /&gt;Bread will be ready to go before 4:00 in time to enjoy with your Sunday dinner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will leave with a new and ancient knowledge, a loaf of bread and your very own sourdough culture to use at home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a quart jar for your sourdough culture and a snack to share with the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a $5 fee to cover the cost of ingredients in the bread and culture.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal who opens the door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239074979000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234303253000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sourdough Workshop- Cultivate a Culture</name><id>9715491</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237741200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/9715491/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/7/global_7064327.jpeg</photo_url></item>
