Most ice skating rinks are managed by the state and have closed for the season. Simoni ice skating rink in Cambridge is privately managed and is open for a couple more weeks.&amp;nbsp; It's $5.00 to skate, and if you don't have your own skates there is a $4.00 rental fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to meet at 2:00 p.m. in outside in front of the rink.&amp;nbsp; If people are interested, we can gather afterwards at the East Side Bar &amp;amp; Grille.&amp;nbsp; Closest T stop is Lechmere on the green line at First Street, so about a 6 block walk. There are also buses that travel down this street. If you are driving, the rink has a parking lot. It's also located next to Twin City Plaza on McGrath/O'Brien Highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if your plans change, please update your RSVP. If you have any questions, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Outside in front of the rink</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dee</member_name><member_id>4101956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301930500000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>All of the rinks are closing for the season.</why><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1301069622000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>One More Ice Skate</name><id>17053642</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301853600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/17053642/</event_url></item>
