Are you the only one in your familywho knows where clothes and toys belong? Perhaps you are tired of being the sole organizer, and would like more involvement from your family? There is hope, and we'll present ways to get everyone in your family--from the youngest to the oldest--on the same team. We will review children's developmental stages, needs, and challenges. Next we will explore ways to build on your children's strengths, and learn to put creativity and cooperative play into clean-up time. You will also receive specific organizing tips for household hotspots,including incoming mail and kids' school and art work. Our lecture will close with a Q&amp;amp;A session, so please bring your specific questions and organizing challenges with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanya</member_name><member_id>7153030</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253192047000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249246073000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Uncluttered Familyâ€”Tips for an Organized Home</name><id>11016709</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252971000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/11016709/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/5/a/global_8459978.jpeg</photo_url></item>
