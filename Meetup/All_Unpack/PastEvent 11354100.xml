Looking forward to seeing you on Monday! I will be coming home from Temple Sinai in Brookline after services so probably will be there around 6:45. But, my son Erik will be there and those of you who would like to come earlier to help set up the food that would be great! I will post the directions to my house below! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will provide lox, bagels, cream cheese, and paper goods. Some of you have already volunteered to bring things and so that will be listed below. If not, I would like to assign you an item to bring, or if there is something else you would prefer to make, please let me know as soon as possible! thanks!
