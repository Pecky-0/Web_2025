&lt;p&gt;Pats top Texans to set up AFC Championship rematch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published January 14, 2013&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foxboro, MA –  &lt;/span&gt;After putting the New England Patriots back in a very familiar position, Tom Brady now finds himself in an unprecedented place in the record books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star quarterback threw for 344 yards and three touchdowns to lead New England to its second straight trip to the AFC Championship Game, with the defending conference champions advancing with a 41-28 triumph over the Houston Texans in Sunday's Divisional Playoff from Gillette Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brady completed 25-of-40 passes without an interception en route to his 17th career postseason victory as a starting signal-caller, moving him past Hall of Famer Joe Montana and into sole possession of first place on the NFL's all- time list in that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He's our leader, and we all follow him," said Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. "He led the team today along with a lot of other guys, but he certainly did his part, as he's done many times before. No quarterback I'd rather have than Tom Brady."&lt;/p&gt;
