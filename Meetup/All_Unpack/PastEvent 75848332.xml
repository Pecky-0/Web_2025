&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: The weather is going to beeeeeeeeeautiful on Sunday.  Weatherman is predicting a nice breezy upper 70s day in Boston! Awesome! Makes for a great way to end the weekend. :) We've got about 30 people signed up across the groups. HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us again for some patio action at Battery Park Bar &amp;amp; Lounge in the Financial District of Boston.  We got a good group going in July and it was fun times! Battery Park is welcoming MeetUp back with an outside bartender, games, cornhole, door prizes and a yet to be named beer/liquor sponsor. DJs Doze and Frank White will be spinning old skool hip hop, R&amp;amp;B and reggae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, their Sunday brunch goes until 3pm and includes a "Make Your Own" Bloody Mary bar. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park is welcoming us with open arms. We'll be doing door prize giveaways!   BP is offering $4 Twisted Tea, PBR and Naraganssett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This event is cross-listed with 4 other MeetUp groups. Let's take over the patio AGAIN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery Park is conveniently located in the Financial District of Boston.  It is close to State Street (Orange and Blue Lines), Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red Lines), and a short walk from Gov't Center or Park Street (Green Line).  Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU GO.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
