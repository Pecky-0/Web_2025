People will be talking about it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance 6.10 mi &lt;br /&gt;Time Approximately 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2537 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -2361 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Change+177 ft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we will hike about 4.50 miles and climb about 1,872 feet. It should take an average hiker about 4 hours and 15 minutes to complete this hike (this estimate includes 60 minutes for rest breaks and lunch) and its intensity is considered to be MODERATE. &lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 10:00 AM at the Ethan Pond Trailhead which is located at the Willey House Station site in a parking area just below the railroad tracks, reached by a paved road 0.3 miles long that leaves the west side of US 302 directly opposite the Webster Cliff Trail, about 1.0 mile south of the Willey House site. &lt;br /&gt;We will leave a car or two at the Ethan Pond Trailhead (which is actually the end point of our hike) and then carpool the short distance to where we will begin our hike - the Arethusa Falls Trailhead. The Arethusa Falls Trailhead is located on a spur road off the west side of Route 302, 3.4 miles south of the Willey House site in Crawford Notch State Park. There is plenty of parking space in the lot just off US 302 if the upper lot spaces are full. &lt;br /&gt;INTERESTING FACTS &lt;br /&gt;Arethusa Falls (200 feet high - highest in New Hampshire) and Ripley Falls (100 feet high) are situated on brooks that flow down the steep west side of Crawford Notch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition we will hike round trip to Frankenstein Cliff's.  The round trip of 1.6 miles is included in the above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All participants are responsible to read and agree to the Liability and Waiver claimer on this Website and also to read and abide by the following: The Hiker Responsibility Code &amp;amp; Leave No Trace Principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All participants should know their own abilities.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dianne and I will be in a black four door Toyota Echo with Maine plates</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Don</member_name><member_id>5949952</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1241878359000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238000616000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arethusa Falls + Ripley Falls </name><id>10033285</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241357400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/10033285/</event_url></item>
