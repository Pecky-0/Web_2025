It begins and ends easily with oftentimes flat terrain. The trail becomes very steep while ascending Flume. It is a cruise over to Liberty. Followed by a steep descent down the Liberty Spring Trail where you return to flat ground retracing your steps to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;     You begin your hike from the parking lot just north of the Flume Visitors Center. This is the Whitehouse Trail although it is not clearly identified. Follow the blue blazes that start near the outhouse. You'll be heading north paralling NH 3. It's a pleasant hike on the Whitehouse Path, the bike path, and the Liberty Spring Trail to the junction with the Flume Slide Trail. The Flume Slide Trail is also pleasant and relatively flat in the beginning. You are working your way around the base of Mt. Liberty to reach the base of Mt. Flume. As you do so you cross several rivers. So your first 3-4 miles are easy.&lt;br /&gt;     When you reach the base of Flume, the steepness begins. It is very steep. You are literally rock climbing. Although I haven't heard of anyone securing safety ropes, a fall could lead to serious injury. Also, I lost track of the blazes a few times but as long as you keep climbing upward on the rocks, you'll be staying on the trail, even though you'll doubt yourself. Most hikers prefer to go up Flume Slide Trail rather than down because of the steepness. Climbing on these rocks can be treacherous when wet so only do this hike in dry weather. Also, the Flume and Liberty summits are very exposed with excellent views so it is best to save this hike for a day when the weather and visibility are good.&lt;br /&gt;     You will love the 360 degree views from Flume and Liberty. Flume is the southernmost mountain in the spectacular Franconia Range. Its sisters on the Range, from south to north are Liberty (4,459 ft.), Little Haystack (4,780 ft.), Lincoln (5,089 ft.), Lafayette (5,260 ft.), and Garfield (4,500 ft.). Flume commands 360Â° views from its summit: to the north are the mountains of the Franconia Range (Little Haystack is blocked from view by neighbor Liberty), Loon to the south, the Pemigewasset Wilderness, Owl's Head, the Bonds, Bondcliff, and Washington to the east, and Moosilauke and the Kinsmans to the west.&lt;br /&gt;     From Flume, it's an easy mile to Liberty. Similar excellent views await you on the summit of Liberty. You will not be able to see Lafayette or Garfield to the north because they are obstructed by Lincoln. But you will be able to see Canon to the west.&lt;br /&gt;     It's a quick 0.3 mi. to the junction of the Franconia Ridge Trail and the Liberty Spring Trail. The Liberty Spring Trail is a steep descent.  Continue down the moderately steep Liberty Spring Trail until you reach the bike path and retrace your steps to the parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;In addition, since weather conditions can change rapidly above treeline, please bring a wool hat, mittens/gloves and multiple layers of clothing to wear. At this time of year it can be rather warm or cool, so please be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, or I can provide any additional information, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>DIANNE AND I WILL BE IN A FOUR DOOR BLACK ECHO WITH MAINE LICENSE PLATES</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DIANNE AND PAUL</member_name><member_id>4968533</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223514579000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220895260000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt.
