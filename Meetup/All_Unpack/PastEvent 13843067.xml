Come make more friends to climb with, meet regulars, new and different climbers, and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet up at 6:30 PM by the benches in the central TV room/area, to make introductions and team up.  If arriving later, just come find us on the walls.  I'll post what I plan to wear to this page the day before to help locate us, but if you have any trouble, the front desk staff should be able to point me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRG has great variety, something for everyone, and a friendly community atmosphere.  Pure slab, vertical, and sustained overhanging routes, multiple cracks, dihedrals for stemming and laybacks, and more, for practicing and building many different techniques and strengths.  Over 40 topropes, 3 bouldering areas including a full bouldering room and a large cave, and sport leading on overhung walls and the ceiling.  Leading the ceiling is a ton of fun, straight on or via the dark crystal, that moves!  High quality wall route and boulder problem setting (some of the best in the east) for fun and challenge.  From easy juggy speed routes to super hard 5.13 and V10+ problems, you'll find it here.  Let us know your interests!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've never climbed there before, you'll need to take &amp;amp; pass a belay test for rope climbing.  Call the gym or see the website below for more info.  Full-access Day Pass $16.  Bouldering-Only Pass $14. On Thursdays (I think) students get in for half price.  If interested in regular workouts, I'd recommend checking out membership prices, definitely saves you money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info and directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonrockgym.com/general_info.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonrock...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>9443907</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277489954000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276894588000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BRG Thursday</name><id>13843067</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277418600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/13843067/</event_url></item>
