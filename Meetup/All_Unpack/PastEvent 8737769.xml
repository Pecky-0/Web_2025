That's why I'm doing another &amp;quot;New Member Mixer&amp;quot; at Cambridge Common.  We've been here before and really enjoyed ourselves last time.  They have great beer samplers and yummy food.  &lt;a href="http://www.cambridgecommonrestaurant.com/main.html" target="_blank"&gt;Peep it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to see new faces - do not be scared!  We are a loving, awesome, fun, and fun-loving group of people who absolutely love to have a good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news: I'd love to get a few bucks from each of you guys towards the $75 membership fee for Meetup.com.  Is it possible to get a $2-$5 donation from each of you when you come?  I'd really appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You can call me.  413-695-2121!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223070750000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221154346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New (and Existing) Member Mixer</name><id>8737769</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222210800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/8737769/</event_url></item>
