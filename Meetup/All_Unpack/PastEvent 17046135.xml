If you need more informaton about the movie, go to &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com"&gt;http://www.imdb.com&lt;/a&gt;. For more information about the movie theater, go to &lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheaters.com/"&gt;http://www.landmarktheaters.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for me and my bright red backpack in the theater lobby between 4:30 and 4:45 p.m. I'll buy my ticket at 4:30 p.m. and wait by the foot of the staircase in the lobby until 4:45, maybe 4:50. I want to see the previews, so if you are running late, you can find me in the auditorium reading the credits after the movie. I'll linger a bit in the lobby after the movie and the credits, too,&amp;nbsp;in case people would like to go The Friendly Toast (&lt;a href="http://www.thefriendlytoast.net"&gt;http://www.thefriendlytoast.net&lt;/a&gt;) for tea, hot chocolate, or something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to postpone this event from Wednesday, March 23. My apologies if the schedule change created any confusion, but I couldn't repost this until I was sure that the Kendall was still showing The King's Speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Note the new movie time.
