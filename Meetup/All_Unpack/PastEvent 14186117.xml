I figure summer weekends are hard to attend with lots of travel going on and with the weather getting 'hot hot hot' maybe an evening ride is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's see who shows up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a new route for me - about 15 miles - that winds through Foxboro and Plainville. Because there's ample parking here, we'll start near the Walgreens/Waxy O'Connors parking lot (new shopping center on 140 across from Dairy Queen). Look for the bikes - we'll be in the side parking lot closest to the cleaners/gift store/Waxy's Tanorama stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MapMyRide.com is having a technical glitch -- so I'm not sure the map is going to come up correctly but if you're interested in the route, &lt;a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/route/us/ma/foxborough/599127881058073701" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or if you want to try mapping it for yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul type="1" class="fakeOL"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Head south on 140 onto South Street for 2.3 miles to crossroads (West Street and N. Grove Street)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Left for 0.6 mile to end (Rte 106). There's a steep hill at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right for 0.1 mile to S. Grove Street on left immediately after the bridge over I-495.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Straight for 2.5 miles to Route 152 at traffic light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Straight for 0.4 mile to crossroads (George Street)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right for 0.5 mile to Route 1, at stop sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right for 0.4 mile to Shepard Street, which bears right. You'll pass Turnpike Lake on your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear right for 0.4 mile to end (Route 152)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Left for 0.4 mile to Mirimichi Street for right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right for 2.3 miles to end at traffic island. The main road bears right after 0.4 mile and crosses Lake Mirimichi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Left for 0.3 mile to Mill Street on right (sign says TO STATE FOREST).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right for 1.3 miles to fork (Prospect Street, unmarked, bears left).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear left for 0.8 mile to end (Granite Street, unmarked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right for 0.9 mile to end (Route 140). You'll pass Sunset Lake on your left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn right on Route 140.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bethany</member_name><member_id>10111481</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280412066000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279846090000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weeknight "Stroll" -- 15 mile ride</name><id>14186117</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280269800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/14186117/</event_url></item>
