<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 200 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 9:00 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 9:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have): &lt;br /&gt;* Take I 84 west &amp;amp; get off exit 6&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp turn right &amp;amp; follow route 37 west for 4.5 miles&lt;br /&gt;* Turn right at intersection onto route 39 north, &amp;amp; travel for 3.7 miles&lt;br /&gt;* Parking lot will be on your left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A park hiking map is at: &lt;a href="http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/maps/squantzpond.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://dep.state.ct.u...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO Children or Dogs, Singles only (this doesn't mean you can't have a boyfriend or girlfriend).
