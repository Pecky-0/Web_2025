<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I have 15 Quantum of Solace passes that invites 2 each enough for 30 movie members to group up where I will be standing at 6:15pm next to the Ticket man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say 6:15pm because there will be a huge line forming up and I want all of us to get in line just in time. We'll head up at 6:30pm so we can all get in line for the 7:00pm Quantum of Solace movie.   The Manager of Lowell Theater has spoken to me over the phone that you could only get in with the original movie pass. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, just call me at my cellphone: 617-435-8177&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Windsor&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Sedona Greenish Cap standing next to the Ticket guy</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230918603000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226201871000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quantum of Solace - James Bond - 15 Original Passes here</name><id>9123997</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226618100000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/9123997/</event_url></item>
