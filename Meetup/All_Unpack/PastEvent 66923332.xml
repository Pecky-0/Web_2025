The Ice Cream Stand at Great Brook Farm State Park was shut down by the bureaucrats for two weeks for “violations” of regulations. The loss of business and cost for compliance has almost overwhelmed the family run business that leases the property from the Commonwealth. We are hoping to gather freedom loving patriots from all around the state to come and buy ice cream as we gather and picnic in the public park. There are several picnic tables and lots of beautiful grassy picturesque spot to have lunch. Come and go as your schedule allows and meet with other patriots, activists and ice cream lovers! Bring the whole family. Metered parking is available and there is no fee to enter the park. The fresh locally made ice cream is competitively priced and features a full ice cream sundae selection, cones, bowls, etc. There are cows, goats, sheep, chickens, rabbits, pigs and more on this working farm that can be petted and fed by children of all ages. All feed must be purchased from the vending machines, no ice cream for the animals!
