As individuals, we can't do much, but as a group, we can have an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we may have a special guest attend, Vinnie Forras, who is running for Dodd's Senate seat now that Dodd has decided to &amp;quot;retire&amp;quot; due to his low poll numbers. Let's meet him and hear what he has to say and ask our questions in an informal setting. When it's confirmed, I'll let you know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll also have Block Blumy yard signs and bumper stickers for sale for those who'd like them. It was our Dump Dodd sign campaign that helped drive down Dodd's poll numbers and we're hoping for the same results with our Block Blumy campaign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266621255000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265985196000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meeting and Planning Session</name><id>12588377</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266447600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/12588377/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/4/global_10345540.jpeg</photo_url></item>
