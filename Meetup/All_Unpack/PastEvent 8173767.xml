After he was taken in and nursed back to health by the people of an impoverished Pakistani village, Mortenson promised to return one day and build them a school. From that rash, earnest promise grew one of the most incredible humanitarian campaigns of our time ? Greg Mortenson's one-man mission to counteract extremism by building schools, especially for girls, throughout the breeding ground of the Taliban.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Award-winning journalist David Oliver Relin has collaborated on this spellbinding account of Mortenson's incredible accomplishments in a region where Americans are often feared and hated. In pursuit of his goal, Mortenson has survived kidnapping, fatwas issued by enraged mullahs, repeated death threats, and wrenching separations from his wife and children. But his success speaks for itself. At last count, his Central Asia Institute had built fifty-five schools. Three Cups of Tea is at once an unforgettable adventure and the inspiring true story of how one man really is changing the world ? one school at a time.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're trying to get outside while the getting's good.  Weather permitting, we'll be sitting in Harvard Yard, directly in front of the John Harvard Statue (or as close to that location as possible).  The yard is easily accessible by T:  get off at the Harvard Stop, exit towards the Yard (opposite church street) and head through the gate and straight ahead to the Statue..  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find yourself in the &amp;quot;pit&amp;quot; by Out of Town News, cross Mass Ave, head North up Mass Ave (towards Porter Square) and cross into the yard at the above gate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a large group of people sitting on the lawn in front of the statue</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219273690000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213898312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Readers: Three Cups of Tea: by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin</name><id>8173767</id><headcount>31</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219100400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/8173767/</event_url></item>
