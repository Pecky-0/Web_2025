&lt;p&gt;Sean Faircloth will be joining us.&amp;nbsp; He is Executive Director of the Secular Coalition of America. The Secular Coalition for America lobbies on behalf of secular Americans  -- atheists, agnostics, humanists and other freethinkers -- in  Washington, D.C. Sean served ten years in the Maine legislature before  becoming executive director of the Secular Coalition for America. He will be giving a talk titled "One Nation Under the Constitution: A Vision of a Secular America."&amp;nbsp; His  speech will discuss how theocratically based injustices in American law  are not a historical artifact -- but rather a stark current reality. He  argues that Americans have a moral obligation to address these  injustices through rejuvenation of our government's secular heritage and  secular legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event will be followed by a special grassroots lobbying training session. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
