I'm hoping to meet more of our members and hopefully see the 7:00 showing of The Simpsons Movie, Regal theater at the Landmark Center (near the Fenway stop on the D line). Afterwards we can head over to the Cold Stone Creamery next door.&lt;br /&gt;Online tickets for the theater are available at Fandango.com. As we all know, this movie just came out, so get your tickets before they're gone.&lt;br /&gt;We might not be able to sit together, but no worries. If one of us gets separated, we're all adults. I'm going to make you all wear the same colored T-shirts and hold hands in a &amp;quot;buddy system&amp;quot;......or will I? (stroking chin thoughtfully)&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cathy</member_name><member_id>4263429</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185919742000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185212510000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie plus Ice cream night</name><id>6065124</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185746400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/6065124/</event_url></item>
