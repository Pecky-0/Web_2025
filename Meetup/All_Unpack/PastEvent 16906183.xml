We  can play with jam cards, work on journals, make cards for next month's  swaps, or just kick back and play!  A good time to talk about retreat  planning, chunky book swaps, journal jams...lots going on!&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; We always have fun at these smaller Meetups.  Sign up now to join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a chance to get together between Meetups. Use the time to  finish up any projects you're making, work on your ATCs for swaps, or on  anything else you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAY/TIME: Sunday, March 6th, from 1 pm to ???? (Really, we'll stay as  late as anybody wants to stay!) Come for an hour or two; come for the  whole afternoon and into the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGENDA: No scheduled activities. Arrive and leave when you want. Work  on your own projects at your own pace. The only thing we ask is that  you keep your RSVP up to date so we know who's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMENITIES: Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some  tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave,  toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are  interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COST: $10 to help defray the Studio rental costs. (ArtStudio 360 renters attend free.)  &lt;br /&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP: These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting  list. Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function.  Please RSVP for your guests as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP  accordingly. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.  See the end of this message for an important update about RSVPs for Open  Studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT TO BRING: Your own materials and projects to work on (just as  you do for the regular Meetup). But basic supplies -- scissors, glue,  tape, blank ATCS, etc. -- are available for your use. Even if you show  up empty-handed, we can get you started on projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CANCELLATIONS: In the unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even  if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web  site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side,  please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio  360!&lt;/p&gt;
