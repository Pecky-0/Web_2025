Three words not typically seen in the same sentence; but God created all three. How, then, does one relate to the other? And how do we get them to make sense in our mixed up world where confusion and romanticism reign? If you are single and looking for a partner, presently in a relationship, starting a new partnership, str uggling with the relationship you have, or grieving the loss of a relationship, this seminar is for you. Mother Clare Watts will guide you into the mysteries of relationships, energetically and practically, so that you will emerge with a clear understanding of what you have experienced in the past and how to be an active creator in the kind of relationship that will open your heart, mend your hurts, and relieve your fears. Don't miss it! &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296784063000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294331801000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Love, Sex and God with Mother Clare Watts</name><id>15943868</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296779400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/15943868/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/7/global_5804807.jpeg</photo_url></item>
