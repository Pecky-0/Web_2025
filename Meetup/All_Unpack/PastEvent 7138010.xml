It doesn't matter if you've never attended a meetup event before - please come now. Training for phone banking, canvassing and becoming a precinct captain can be offered to anyone as they arrive. It is NOT necessary that you arrive promptly at 9 AM, but if you can come early, by all means do. There's a lot to get done at the new HQ, so please come - with guests! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HQ is very close to Union Station in Worcester, and is accessible if you take the commuter rail from Boston (South Station or Back Bay). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call Bob Dwyer at 508-930-5530 with any questions or comments.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201011038000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Join us because getting precinct captains, phone banking and canvassing are important priorities at this point.</why><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1200603134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Training and Phone Banking in Worcester</name><id>7138010</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200837600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/7138010/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/7/global_1551159.jpeg</photo_url></item>
