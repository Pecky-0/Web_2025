<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Join us as we help one of New Haven's finest (and most critical) non-profit organizations serve dinner to 150-200 of New Haven's hungriest.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The homeless population of New Haven increases greatly in the summertime, just as the school, church, and civic groups that normally assist the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen (DESK) are away on vacation.   There has been an increase in demands for services due to the current economic situation as well.  &lt;b&gt;Because this is the 5th Sunday of the month, DESK doesn't currently have a group scheduled to serve on this evening.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be serving a massive amount of fresh food (no food prep necessary for this commitment) for the 5pm-6pm meal.  We'll need to arrive at 4:30 to help set up, and then will man the stations to dole out the offerings of the evening as efficiently and kindly as possible (it goes very quickly: firsts, seconds, and leftovers are all doled out to 100+ guests in the space of an hour).  Cleanup (sweeping and wiping down tables) is done by 6:15 or 6:30, leaving plenty of time for any plans you already have (or may want to make as a group) afterwards for dinner, beer, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your contact is Michelle.  Feel free to email with any questions or concerns.  I'll be emailing out my cell phone number as a contact to the YES people the day before the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one in latex gloves and a hair net (and so will you at some point)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220387730000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218570078000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The NHC Volunteers: Serving Dinner at D.E.S.K., Redeux</name><id>8529885</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220214600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8529885/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
