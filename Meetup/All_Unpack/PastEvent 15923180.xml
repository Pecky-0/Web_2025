&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;I come from a country full of contradictions and suffering, where there is a dictatorship," and "censorship does not allow me to talk openly about what happens in my country." director Mohammad Rasoulof&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following March, both Rasoulof and world-acclaimed director Jafir Panahi were arrested as part of the government&amp;rsquo;s reaction to those claiming that the election of President Ahmadinejad in June 2009 election was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this dreamlike yet earthbound film, Rahmat the boatman navigates the increasingly brackish waters of a coastal land, collecting the heartaches and tears of its inhabitants. But he remains powerless against their misguided attempts to appease the gods and make the land green again, whether by offering a bride to the sea or forcibly &amp;ldquo;treating&amp;rdquo; the eyes of a painter who sees in different colors. Drawing firsthand on the challenges faced by Iranian artists of today, writer-director Mohammad Rasoulof&amp;rsquo;s deeply atmospheric and poetical film is a gorgeous allegory of intolerance, brutality and mystified routine that resonates far beyond any one state&amp;rsquo;s borders.

&lt;p&gt;Iranian films have a long tradition of brilliant cinematography:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rahmat (Hasan Pourshirazi) sails the pearly pale seas of Lake Urmia, hopping between islands in his rickety rowboat, collecting the locals&amp;rsquo; tears in a playset-sized pitcher. And there are no shortages of tears&amp;mdash;each locale&amp;rsquo;s hardscrabble inhabitants relate their heartaches, but Rahmat also witnesses his fair share: a shaved-hairless dwarf thrown down a well to appease the fairy imprisoned at the bottom; a virgin girl wedded to the sea (i.e. drowned); an artist, mad enough to paint the sea a color other than blue, blinded by monkey urine meant to &amp;ldquo;restore&amp;rdquo; his vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahmat, with an adolescent stowaway (Younes Ghazali) for a companion, wanders this aquatic trail of tears, moving between absurd and surreal set pieces, each illustrating lives sacrificed for strange superstitions. Tribeca Film Festival Dispatch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the film we will go to a nearby restaurant for our group discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296522766000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>its a movie and we go to movies</why><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294195634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Iran's White Meadows</name><id>15923180</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296331200000</time><rsvp_limit>9</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/15923180/</event_url></item>
