I'm afraid I have to leave at 9:00PM .... no dragging me off the walls this friday. And no drinks after (for me - I hope you all still do!).  Note, I'll be there at 6:30 to get a little early start since I can't close the place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you then, &lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal at the picnic table in read pants, grey or white sweatshirt and brown hat if it is cold ...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2680784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206916511000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>To climb or not to climb, that my friends is the question.</why><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205894941000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End O' March Climb</name><id>7560772</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206743400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/7560772/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/8/0/global_3620688.jpeg</photo_url></item>
