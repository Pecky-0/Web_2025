Then you probably had huge family gatherings that seemed to last all day...there was a ton of food, the kids ran around, and everyone asked how school was going!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Too many of us don't have extended family nearby, so let's get together and make sure our kids don't miss out on the same wonderful experience. Catch up on what's been going on the past month, make friends and plans for the coming month!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;We'll do something different every month to keep things interesting. If you have suggestions, please contact Yooree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1333225006000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326561451000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our Monthly Family Meal</name><id>dphhqcyqgbcb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1333220400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/48088692/</event_url></item>
