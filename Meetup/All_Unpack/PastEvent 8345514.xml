I will be leaving Porter Square and heading down to trapelo road and follow it to walden.  I plan on swimming at least from the beach/parking lot side to the opposite side at least once, but will see about doing more, and maybe some drills too depending on who comes and the timing.  After the swim I will ride part way back, then split off to go to work in waltham, but it is super easy to get back to cambridge from there so you don't need to worry about getting lost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be on my bike at Porter Square next to Dunkin Donuts and Qdoba.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216830194000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216142291000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike out to walden/swim</name><id>8345514</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216373400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/8345514/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/2/global_1776498.jpeg</photo_url></item>
