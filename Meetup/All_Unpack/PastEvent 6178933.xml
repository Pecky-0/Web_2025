We had a good turn out for the first meet up and I am excited to go from here.  A group will meet up in the brookline/boston area to bike out to walden.  I will map out the distances and as with the run try to form 2-3 groups for those who want a longer swim and for those who are having their first open water swim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately because of time constraints I won't be able to drive anyone (I will be biking from Walden to work in Waltham).  If you are in need of a ride, just post that in your RSVP message and I'll try to figure something out for you!&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;For those of you brand new to the tri community this will be a great chance to experience some open water swimming in a friendly environment. (I sure wish I had at least practiced open water swimming before my first tri!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update with more details soon.  Please contact me if you have questions or check the site for updates.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as always, if you have suggestions for a meet up whether it be an actual training event or otherwise, let me know!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541949000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187107250000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike to Walden / Swim</name><id>6178933</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188381600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/6178933/</event_url></item>
