Offer Valid through April 1st &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

If you'd like to practice yoga this spring in a beautiful space with wonderful people and you're SOOO BUSY! here's an opportunity for you! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The practice of Yoga, including Pranayama (yogic breathing) and Meditation can be life-changing! So many times I used to say I can’t go to yoga – I’m just too busy – yet, when I do, I find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

• I feel so great afterwards! &lt;br /&gt;

• It is much easier for me to calmly focus and the quality of what I do is much better! &lt;br /&gt;

• Although I notice when someone around me is stressed, I don’t get drawn into it because I have a sense of inner calm and when it’s appropriate it is much easier to step in and be helpful, coming from a place of inner calm &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I also notice… on a physical level… &lt;br /&gt;

• My energy level is higher and more consistent &lt;br /&gt;

• And I am much more flexible than I would be if I just continued my regular routine of walking and swimming. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Take time to discover what the practice does for you! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
