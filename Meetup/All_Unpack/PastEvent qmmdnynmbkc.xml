Lisa Blake, a local meditation teacher, is offering a five week workshop/book group entitled &amp;quot;Peaceful Mind, Compassionate Heart&amp;quot;.

We will follow the book of the same title by my spiritual guide and friend of 8 years, Khen Rinpoche Lobzang Tsetan which offers rich advice to the newcomer as well as seasoned wisdom to for the long-term practitioner. Khen Rinpoche's book gets to the heart of Buddha's advice and directs us how to use spiritual practice to cultivate a peaceful mind and compassionate heart. Each class will be interactive and cover 2 chapters (around 30 pages), concluding with a 15 minute meditation. The class will meet 5 Mondays beginning Sept. 27 - Nov. 1 (skipping Oct. 18) The cost is $75 plus $15 for the book. There will also be one free scholarship for the class, book not included. Lisa V.
