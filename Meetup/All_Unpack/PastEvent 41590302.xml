Live music upstairs and dancing downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live music is the Jimmy Hat Band. The website says: "Looking for a guaranteed good time? PLAY it SAFE with JIMMY HAT! Whether you&amp;rsquo;re after enticing eye candy, electrifying high jinks, quality music, or just a wild weekend, JIMMY HAT has what you need! This animated group is full of entertaining energy that quickly distinguishes them from your average cover band! The only thing this gang of 4-guys-and-a-gal doesn&amp;rsquo;t take too seriously is themselves! That means you get genuine fun in the form of a musical mixed-bag. Jimmy Hat puts a tantalizing twist into all of your favorite tunes! Rocking songs from Bon Jovi to Linkin Park, and from old-school rap to modern pop, this band has what it takes to guarantee your ROCK HARD night out!" They were voted the Hartford Advocate's Best Cover Band in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't make it for the potluck, we'd still love to party with you. Last time we went, it was a really good time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322081197000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321586583000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live music at The Red Door</name><id>41590302</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321671600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/41590302/</event_url></item>
