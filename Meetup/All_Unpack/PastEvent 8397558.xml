Come join us at the newly remodeled, OUTSIDE PATIO at Fireside.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specials are:&lt;br /&gt;Free appetizers&lt;br /&gt;$3 domestic beers, $4 imports&lt;br /&gt;$5 mixed drinks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP so we can get a real count for the manager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy directions from New Haven: Exit 50 off I-95 North from New Haven and points North/West (or Exit 51 from I-95 South, from East Haven and points East).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fireside is located on Woodward Ave, across the street from Citizens Bank and Forbes Gas Station, at Rt 1 and Woodward Ave. From Exit 50, take a LEFT onto Woodward, go straight through the next intersection, and Fireside is on your LEFT. From Exit 51, stay in the right lane, and take a RIGHT onto Woodward Ave, at Citizens Bank. Fireside is on your Left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the directions on Google and Superpages indicate the restaurant is near Fort Hale Park, but this is INCORRECT!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217455909000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>27</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216840559000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour at Fireside on Their Outdoor Patio!</name><id>8397558</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217282400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8397558/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
