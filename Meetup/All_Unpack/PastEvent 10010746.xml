Everyone pays their own.  Order at the counter upstairs and be sure to bring a deck of cards.  If you have a cribbage board please bring that too. March's turnout for this type of event was a huge success thanks to PAULA, and members have asked we have card playing and cribbage games again.  Check out the link above for Tony's Pizza photo tour and for easy directions.  Please be on time at 7 pm (come early if you can).  Parking is right on premises. &lt;a href="http://www.tonyssuttonpizza.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tonyssutto...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sign up early for this event as it will fill up fast.  No fee for this Meetup, just pay for your own supper and drinks! See you there!  Note:  RSVP with Yes or No (Maybe's are not a choice, as the restaurant needs a headcount prior to us arriving) Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Downstairs (bottom floor of restaurant)-Order your food first &amp; head on down!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238886495000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237757070000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cards, Cribbage &amp; Pizza!</name><id>10010746</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238713200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/10010746/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/global_7788295.jpeg</photo_url></item>
