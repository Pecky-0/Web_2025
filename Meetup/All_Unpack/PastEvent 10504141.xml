We will use this meetup to discuss strategy and to make signs.  This is getting put together very rapidly so exact details will be available as we figure them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to become involved and give these assholes a piece of your mind, this would be the time to do it.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Brick and Brown house just  East of Breeze ave on Cresent View Drive</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan DaRocha</member_name><member_id>3370189</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244475106000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Atheist</urlname><id>12929</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Atheist Society</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243439432000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Westboro Baptist Anti-Protest</name><id>10504141</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243553400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Atheist/events/10504141/</event_url></item>
