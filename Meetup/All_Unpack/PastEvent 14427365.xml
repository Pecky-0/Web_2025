The Governor of Massachusetts decided that spectral evidence--evidence from the supernatural--could no longer be admissible in court. October 12th has become a day to renew our resolve to resist supernaturalism, and to celebrate our communities of reason. For more information, please visit &lt;a href="http://secularseasons.org/october/freethought_day.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://secularseasons...&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://freethoughtday.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://freethoughtday...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of our 2010 Freethought Day activities, we'll be gathering for dinner in Salem, Mass. All are welcome, but please do not RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; unless you are sure you plan to attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please use the mailing list or the comments thread on this event page to coordinate carpooling. Members who wish to take public transportion will see that the  Newburyport/Rockport line has a commuter rail stop in Salem, just a few blocks from the downtown area. The last inbound train departs Salem at 10:38, and rolls into North Station at 11:07, leaving you in good position to catch the Green, Blue, Orange or Red line to your destination.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287065233000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281881209000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Freethought Day Program: Dinner in Salem</name><id>14427365</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286748000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/14427365/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/8/global_17192968.jpeg</photo_url></item>
