Please bring something to munch on and share. This is not Indian food themed, so don't feel like you have to bring Indian food (although it is yummy and I won't say no!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that have been to my house: We have redone somethings and will be hanging out in the basement now. Sometimes it gets cold. If you are one of those that gets cold easily, bring an extra sweater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've tended to notice that we have gone off the beaten path of a bollywood movie. I would like to try and get back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies: &lt;br /&gt;Saawariya &lt;br /&gt;Bhoot &lt;br /&gt;Hum Tum&lt;br /&gt;Kambakkht Ishq&lt;br /&gt;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please explore the &amp;quot;view instantly&amp;quot; version of netflix to get some ideas on what you may want to watch!! I can watch items on my tv from the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will not be a car in the driveway.. please use the driveway! Let yourself in. You do not have to take your shoes off cause there are a bunch of shoes by the door! I will make signs to tell you how to get to my basement. Its really easy, but there are stairs!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270591931000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268424904000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bollywood Potluck &amp; Movie Night</name><id>fbnhnyngbgb</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270418400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/12861096/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/7/8/global_9344168.jpeg</photo_url></item>
