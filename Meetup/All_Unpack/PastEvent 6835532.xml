For new guests interested in full membership, we are offering a reduced rate for lodging. The ridiculously cheap cost of $20/night is being reduced. If you come up on Friday 12/14, and pay for 1 night, you can stay Saturday night for free.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 nights for the cost of 1 - what an awesome deal.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plan to ski or board on Saturday 12/15... The weather is looking fantastic right now especially if this weekends snowstorm holds and dumps 15+ inches of snow in the mountains... What a great start to the season!  (already members have skied and have said it was pretty good for what was open!).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a day of skiing, we head back to Wedeln and get ready for our afternoon and evening apres-ski events to the wee hours of the morning!  We will also have a catered dinner available in between the events  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the energy, get you butt our of bed and ski or ride Sunday! Then we'll head home! &lt;br /&gt;Come on up and join us!   &lt;br /&gt;Jonathan  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wedeln.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tara</member_name><member_id>4521773</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197985743000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196516774000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wedeln Christmas Weekend 12/14 - 12/16</name><id>6835532</id><headcount>74</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197676800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/6835532/</event_url></item>
