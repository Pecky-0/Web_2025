I think it will be fun and give us an opportunity to use English in a real setting! It's from 6-9p at the BCA (Boston Center for the Arts) on Tremont and Clarendon St. in the South End, Boston. Please come and meet with us! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is &amp;quot;donation requested&amp;quot;. That means you can pay something if you can, but if you can't you don't have to. The event is an art auction by teens in the South End, the money raised will help the Youth Workers' Alliance agency. If you RSVP on this website, I will contact you to arrange to meet there. See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1114642889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston English as a Second Language May Meetup</name><id>4660448</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1117058400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/4660448/</event_url></item>
