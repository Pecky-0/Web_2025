Here is a description of the workshop from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The more focus you put on something, the more the tendency is to attract it - positive or negative. It makes sense then to focus on what you want much more than what you don't! We'll learn, practice and reinforce focusing on what you want with visualization, clear statements, announcing to others what you want, making lists, making a story board, being receptive and reinforce how to maintain a positive focus throughout the day with an inner and outer smile, breathing techniques, gratitude lists and having fun. We'll also focus on how to manage distressing thoughts to come back to what you want in a positive fashion.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost is $15.00. However, Herb is offering a special rate of $10.00 for this workshop.  A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $10.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Due to the size of the studio, a RSVP limit has been set. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** About Herb Pearce *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce is a relationship coach and workshop leader.
