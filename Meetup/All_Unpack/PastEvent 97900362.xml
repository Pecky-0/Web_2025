It's so hard to believe that the holidays are over and that it's now 2013! Hopefully everyone is staying healthy ... there's a lot of stuff going around ... so be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, Karen Macedo was supposed to present for us on the topic "Creative Cloud", but had to cancel at the last minute due to illness. Well, she's better now and will be giving a presentation for us on the Creative Cloud. In addition to Karen's presentation, if time allows, we will also have a presentation on Adobe's Photoshop Eazel iPad app. Penny and I will have a few iPads with us to pass around for everyone to try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see everyone on Thursday, January 17th at 6:00pm.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Renae Dutile</member_name><member_id>12131424</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364515174000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ManchesterAUG</urlname><id>1532602</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester Adobe User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357323239000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January's Manchester Adobe User Group Meeting ...</name><id>97900362</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358463600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ManchesterAUG/events/97900362/</event_url></item>
