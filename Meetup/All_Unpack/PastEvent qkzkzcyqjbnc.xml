&lt;p&gt;Let's shop for Fruits and Vegetables at Boston Haymarket - around Union and Blackstone Streets (bounded by Faneuil Hall on one side: Orange and Green Lines stop at Haymarket). Food prices are very good (far more affordable than most grocery store prices) and it's a great low-key gathering place! This is a "cross-post" event with &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Vegan-Meetup/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston Vegan Meetup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Vegetarian-Meetup/"&gt;Boston Vegetarian Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, where it occurs each Friday and Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a non-host event, which means that you will be on your own to browse the farmers' market at your own pace. Do not expect for an Organizer to be there from our meetup or any other meetup to greet you. Shop any vendors you like, and leave whenever you are ready. If you would like to be a "Host-Greeter" for this event please let Mara or Daryl know. Feel free to contact members on the RSVP list by clicking their name about a more specific meetup location at the Haymarket at a specific time if you'd like. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Please note that some stall vendors begin packing up a half hour or more early in order to leave as their 'rush business' slows. That prompts them to drop their prices earlier (say around 4:30 pm on Fridays and 5:00 pm on Saturdays).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maynard S.
