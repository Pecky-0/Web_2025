Learning the basics is key to building the strongest foundation. I have found that one of the staples for my teaching to be the works of Abraham Hicks. The information is clear and concise and does not change over time. It addresses the questions of the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual needs that we all face on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I invite everyone that has ready the first book of &amp;quot;Ask and It Is Given&amp;quot; to join us for discussion on the content and the tools. If you haven't read it, I challenge you to pick up a copy, read it and join the discussion. We live in a face paced world and the information on enlightenment is flying at us. We as a group can expotentially increase our awareness and live a happier more meaningful live with all this great information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More announcements are coming on some excellent speakers that are going to be joining the group in upcoming meetings. Stay tuned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and ~~ Happy Living to you all~~~&lt;br /&gt;Barb&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284381651000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279910018000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ask and It Is Given, Book Review</name><id>14192627</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284072300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/14192627/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/4/global_9559044.jpeg</photo_url></item>
