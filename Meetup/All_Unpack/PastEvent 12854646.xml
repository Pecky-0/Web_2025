We'll be playing for low-stakes cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone bring a snack to share!  Post a note and let us all know what you'll be bringing so we don't have duplicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 6:30 pm - 9 pm.   Even if you can just come for a short time, still come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place: Our home in West Roxbury (bordering Brookline and Jamaica Plain). &lt;br /&gt;***Note: I will provide the exact address and my phone number to those who RSVP.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's easy to get here from all over Boston - we're inside the 128 corridor. Also great for those in Boston not wanting to drive - we're just 1 block from the Commuter Rail Bellevue Station (13 minutes from Back Bay, 17 minutes from South Station)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to take the Commuter Rail? Take the Needham Line to Bellevue Station. A train arrives here at 6:21pm which will get you here just in time. There are trains back to the city at 7:43 and 9:20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Stacy and Ingo&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacy Goodman</member_name><member_id>3216337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272062326000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268358428000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Poker Night!</name><id>12854646</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271889000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/12854646/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
