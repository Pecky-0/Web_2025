As the name implies, there is normally ice visible in spots along the trail. There are also some rare plant communities, that are described in this link &lt;a href="http://www.nhdfl.org/library/pdf/Natural%20Heritage/icegulch.pdf" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.nhdfl.org/library/pdf/Natural%20Heritage/icegulch.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a hot day the temperature in the notch is rarely above 65 degrees and in some spots, there are local fog banks to add to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the link describes, the actual gulch is a combination of hiking and scrambling over boulders some of which have deep drops in between them. If you arent comfortable climbling up and over occasion small boulders and using you hands for support in places, this may not be a hike for you. If you have hiked the Subway in nearby Kings Ravine and enjoyed it, this is longer version with a few less caves. This hike is also an excellent prep hike for those who might want to visit Mahoosuc Notch in the future. Generally this hike is best done with a small group so that the hikers can help each other out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three springs at the end of the Gulch but no accessible water prior to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike has a 9 AM start time and should take 4 to 5 hours allowing those with a long drive home, plenty of time to head south. The actual mileage is 6 miles but the stetch through the gulch takes far longer than "book" time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the occasional scrambling, its important that your day pack fits well and if you use poles, they should be collapsible and able to be stored securely. Many folks like to carry gloves as the rocks can be rough. Please bring a long sleeve shirt in the pack or fleece as in some cases, its cool enough to require an extra layer even on a 80 degree day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at the Randolph Paddle Tennis court at the junction of Randolph Hill Road and High Acres Road (this used to be referred to as the Mt Crescent House site in older guides). We will then spot a car at the southerly trailhead. and then take the Boothman Spring trail to the Cook path to the head of the Gulch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately due to the many deep crevises, this is not a suitable hike for dogs and therefore its dog free event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note this is a downhile hike through the gulch, I have done it in both directions and comtrary tot he current white moutnain guide editors, going down the gulch is the best way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
