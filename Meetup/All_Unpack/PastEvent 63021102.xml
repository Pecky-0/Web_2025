&lt;p&gt;Chunky's is located behind the Home Depot/Haluwa/Burlington Coat Factory mall, off the Broad St exit of Route 3 at 151 Coliseum Ave, Nashua, NH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie starts at 7:40, but we like to meet and greet an hour before, to drink and dine if you like. Full cash bar, even includes martinis and margaritas. And don't forget those big comfy leather chairs.  Very nice to watch a movie in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be in the lobby at 6:40ish (not too big an area) so you can wait outside if it's nice out, if you want a pass for $5.  The cost of the movie is $7.50. I'll have a meetup badge on, in case you don't know me.  If you get there late and want to try texting me for a pass, I'll come out.  603-235-9373&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any ideas about Friday or Saturday dancing to a live band, please let me know. &lt;/p&gt;
