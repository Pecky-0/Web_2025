I cannot do this on Friday, so I will be climbing on Thursday instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder.  For more information see: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/everett.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you there! &lt;br /&gt;Lopa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  How to find me: I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black prAnA shorts and a green/red/blue shirt.  I will wait till 7:15 pm and if you arrive after that you'll have to come find me. :) I will have a description of what I'm wearing on the whiteboard near the restrooms.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black pants and a green/red/blue shirt.
