The bare summit slab provides 180-degree views north towards the mountain ranges lining the Kancamagus. This hike is an out-and-back excursion on the Mount Osceola Trail. There are no sections of extreme exposure on this hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very popular hike and the trailhead parking area does fill pretty early, so we do need to be at the trailhead by 9:00.  &lt;b&gt;Please note that the hike will start PROMPTLY at 9:00 AM.&lt;/b&gt;  A USFS Parking Day Pass IS required at this parking area.  A day pass will be available at the trailhead for $3.00 at the self-serve kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Although there are some ledges on this trail, the hike is suitable for bad weather.  Rain will NOT cancel hiking plans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note that dogs are not permitted on this hike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What:&lt;/i&gt;  Mount Osceola&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Distance:&lt;/i&gt; 6.4 miles out-and-back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/i&gt; 2343'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difficulty:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pace:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate.  Approximately 1.5 - 2.0 miles per hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exposure:&lt;/i&gt; No serious exposure on this loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Estimated Time:&lt;/i&gt; 5 1/2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is This Hike for Me?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike will be at a&lt;b&gt;moderate pace&lt;/b&gt;. The goal will be to support hikers new to the White Mountains in achieving a 4000 foot summit.  We make every attempt to keep the group together throughout the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To participate you should:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable hiking UPHILL at about 1.5 to 2.0 miles per hour at a 15% incline for about 4 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable walking at least 8 miles on uneven terrain including roots, rocks, and granite ledges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have sturdy hiking boots.  &lt;b&gt;No Sneakers&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have rain and wind protection.  &lt;b&gt;No Ponchos&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be able to carry at least 2-3 liters of water. (3 strongly recommended.)  (Remember, 1 liter weighs 2 pounds!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be in good physical condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equipment List&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synthetic shirt and pants. &lt;b&gt;No cotton.  No jeans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sturdy Hiking Boots.  &lt;b&gt;No Sneakers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rain / Wind Jacket. &lt;b&gt;No Ponchos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm fleece layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something warm for the summit.  Expect it to be very windy, and expect much cooler temperatures this time of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-3 liters Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headlamp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trail Snacks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lunch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bug Repellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optional Gear:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiking Poles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gaiters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen / Sunglasses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camera / Binoculars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Jeans, Sneakers, or Cotton clothing on the hike!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lodging Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that Osceola is very practical as a day-hike from Rhode Island.  This section on lodging is included for those that wish to stay over one or two nights around the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several motels in the area that are reasonable this time of year.  This time of year is entering &amp;quot;leaf peeper&amp;quot; season, so I strongly recommend booking early. Three places that I stay are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EconoLodge in Lincoln, NH.  (603) 745-3661&lt;br /&gt;Mount Coolidge Motel in Lincoln, NH.  (603) 745-8052&lt;br /&gt;Red Roof Inn in Plymouth, NH.  (603) 536-2330 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dining Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakfast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stay in the Lincoln area, Pegs on Rte 3 (next to Woodstock Station) opens at 5:30 AM and serves a great breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stay in the Plymouth area, Annie's Overflow just off Exit 25 opens at 6:00 AM and is also excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch / Dinner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will plan to stop for lunch or dinner after the hike.  There are several locations close to the trailhead that work well and will be discussed the day of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Car Pooling is strongly encouraged.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I-93 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Exit 28 in NH towards Waterville Valley.  Turn RIGHT onto Route 49 East for 10.2 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn LEFT onto Tripoli Road.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Tripoli Road about 4.5 miles to the parking area on the right.  Note that Tripoli road is a dirt road for about 3.5 of those miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that there is a Tripoli Road Exit on I-93 further north.  Most GPS units, Mapquest, Bing, and Google will all attempt to route you that way.  Do NOT follow those directions.  That section of Tripoli Road is extremely rough and suitable for 4WD high clearance vehicles only.  Follow the directions I listed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total driving time from Providence, approximately 3.5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trails and Other Info&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will take the Mt. Osceola Trail 3.2 miles to the summit of Mt. Osceola.  We will gain 2343' in elevation.  The grade is relatively moderate the entire way, with several sections of smooth rock ledges, although there is no exposure to speak of.  The summit has nice views to the north. Total distance is 6.4 miles on this out-and-back hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that a White Mountain Parking Pass IS required at the trailhead.  You may pick a day pass up at the self-service station at the trailhead for $3.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gas Stations: I have found that the cheapest gas in the area is typically at either the Mobil Station or the Irving Station just off Exit 23 on I-93.  It's a good idea to fill-up there on your drive north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide my cell phone number along with a link to a detailed trail map to all &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; RSVPs the week of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liability Waiver&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you for yourself, your heirs, executors, and administrators release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Grey Hyundai Sonata with RI License Plates.  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Correia</member_name><member_id>8033800</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284932608000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278467971000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mount Osceola</name><id>14023715</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284814800000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/14023715/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/c/global_5586652.jpeg</photo_url></item>
