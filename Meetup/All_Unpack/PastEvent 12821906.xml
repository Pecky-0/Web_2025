Just as he and his overweight buddies seem beaten down, Herzl meeets Kitano, a Sushi restaurant owner, and discovers the one place where big guys can become rock stars: Japanese sumo wrestling.  This endearing and poignant comdey traces their tender and funny paths from body shame to body celebration, from lonliness to love.  Rich in belly laughs, A Matter of Size tops the scales with its plus-sized heart.&lt;br /&gt;Winner of 4 2009 Ophir Awards, Israeli Film and Television Academy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby about 8:10 sitting at a table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269304483000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268092026000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Matter of Size</name><id>12821906</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269131400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/12821906/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
