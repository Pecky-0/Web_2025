The Shift by Wayne Dyer and the Meaning to Ambition are the same movie, just different titles. For all you Wayne Dyer fans you are going to love the simplicity of the way this movie plays out. The stories help each of us to relate to the changes the characters are going through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this change happens you are changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching a movie that explains the changes in life as clearly as this is rare. When we go through a change in the middle of our life it does not have to be negative. Men go from achievment oriented to spiritual and women go from caretaker of all to wanting to be educated and learning about themself. This movie is enlighting and refreshing. Class fee is $10 per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:30 to 7:00 Let's chat and get to know each other.&lt;br /&gt;7-9 Movie&lt;br /&gt;9-10 discussion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please call for questions&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261497153000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258047811000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Meaning to Ambition- Movie and Discussion</name><id>11859584</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260574200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/11859584/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/4/global_9559044.jpeg</photo_url></item>
