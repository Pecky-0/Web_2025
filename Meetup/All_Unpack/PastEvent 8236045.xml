I cannot stress enough how important it is that the attendees all obtain a similar level of fluency. If you find yourself (and I will find you too) struggling to follow the conversation half the time during the event please consider taking a class or getting a language partner before joining us again. I hope everyone will follow this rule voluntarily. If not, you will find yourself unRSVPed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Game&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:30- 6:40&lt;br /&gt;Jiko Shoukai&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:40- 7:25&lt;br /&gt;ADVANCED ENGLISH&lt;br /&gt;Please use English only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:25- 8:10&lt;br /&gt;ADVANCED JAPANESE&lt;br /&gt;Please use Japanese only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:10 - 8:30&lt;br /&gt;FLEXIBLE TIME&lt;br /&gt;Free Conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rules&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check your level before RSVPing&lt;br /&gt;Try your best to be on time, or at least show up before 7:00&lt;br /&gt;No English during Japanese-Only practice&lt;br /&gt;No Japanese during English-Only practice&lt;br /&gt;No inappropriate comments/jokes&lt;br /&gt;No showing up without RSVPing&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alisa</member_name><member_id>2778908</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216742754000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214690305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Coffee- for Advanced Speakers</name><id>8236045</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216333800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/8236045/</event_url></item>
