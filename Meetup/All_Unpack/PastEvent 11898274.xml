I live in East Cambridge, near Cambridge St.  I will give address &amp;amp; phone only to attendees later.  Bring your songs/originals and copies of any you really want to do.  I have song books, and computer for downloading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have guitars/keyboard, if you play something else bring it.  Think about what you want to do.  Here is a list that members want to do, or check the Ideas posted previously for more items:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forming a band, or network of musicians to perform as a band&lt;br /&gt;Music to help world/personal consciousness&lt;br /&gt;Jam sessions leading to other collaboration (weekly/monthly)&lt;br /&gt;Jam sessions to develop and arrange your songs&lt;br /&gt;A CD project recording original songs from group members&lt;br /&gt;Rehearsing originals or covers to play at open mikes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also thinking of going to the Squawk Cafe on Thursday nite, and possibly rehearsing before.  If any one is interested, especially if you can't make it Sunday, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>9500592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1259093471000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Musicians &amp; Songwriters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild</urlname><id>1420875</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The NEW England Singer Songwriter Musician Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258496742000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jam/Reheasal/Meet Kickoff Event</name><id>11898274</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258920000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild/events/11898274/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/2/a/global_11501162.jpeg</photo_url></item>
