Since we're doing two meet-ups this month.  I think one will be outside and one inside.  : )  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fort Washington is in Cambridge.  It's on Waverly St between Erie and Putnam.  Be careful if you google it!  There's a Waverly Street in Brighton!!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link for directions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=waverly+street,+cambridge,+ma&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;om=1&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;ll=42.352328,-71.106477&amp;amp;spn=0.013733,0.043001&amp;amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank"&gt;Google Map&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Google does a pretty good job of providing directions.  If you're having particular difficulty, let me know where you're coming from and I'll try to help!  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see everyone there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancellation procedure: If it is raining, too hot, too cold, etc. a cancellation notice will be sent via email and posted on the meetup website 2 hours prior to the meetup time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Meetup.com charges each group a $15 a month meetup fee. This is a GROUP fee and if not paid, our Boston French Bulldog meetups, would not exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is in charge of paying this fee every month. It would be greatly appreciated if at each meetup, each member can submit a donation that goes towards the monthly $15 fee. Give $1, give $10. If at the end of the meetup, the organizer has not collected enough to meet the $15, she will pay the difference. If she receives more than $15, the extra would go towards the next meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to allow payment by PayPal, I had to put a minimum &amp;quot;Suggested Donation.&amp;quot;  This is just to cover the meetup.com fee.  You can give whatever you feel is appropriate.  The cost is $15 per month, so you don't have to give every month either.  Whatever works for you.  And you can do it through PayPal or at the MeetUp.  Hope this helps!! &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168887818000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1166285435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston French Bulldog January Meetup</name><id>5330649</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168714800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/5330649/</event_url></item>
