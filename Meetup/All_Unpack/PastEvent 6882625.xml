I'm sure most of you have seen it but there is an outdoor skating rink in Boston common and I thought it would be fun to try it out. I don't know how to ice skate yet but I have done alot of slipping on ice over the last couple of weeks so I think I'll be ready for the next step. Speaking with people at the pub crawl I discovered that most of us haven't been iceskating so  think there will be a few of us hanging onto the side wall and falling down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, this being an Aussie event we will be heading to a nearby pub to warm up afterwards. I think we might try the 21st Amendment on Capital Hill, I haven't been there before so I'll confirm the afterpub a bit later. If you really don't want to do the iceskating, you could always meet us at the pub. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if this something you would like to do. If it is something you would like but the date isn't good let me know that too. I may need to look at booking depending on numbers. I also need to confirm the price but I think its about $20 to hire the sakes and skate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,  &lt;br /&gt;Amy&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy</member_name><member_id>3466832</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200423940000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197211617000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Iceskating in Boston Common</name><id>6882625</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200250800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/6882625/</event_url></item>
