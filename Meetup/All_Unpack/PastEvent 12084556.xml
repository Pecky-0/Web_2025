A civil war has just broken out in the obscure country of Ishmaelia.  Lord Copper, the publisher of &lt;i&gt;the Daily Beast&lt;/i&gt;, a leading British newspaper that &amp;quot;stands for strong, mutually antagonistic governments everywhere,&amp;quot; believes coverage of the war is imperative.  Enter William Boot, a innocent hick from the country who writes careful essays about the habits of the badger. Through a series of accidents and mistaken identity, Boot is hired as a war correspondent for the Beast. The uncomprehending Boot is dispatched of Ishmaelia without further ado. Although he has no idea what he is doing and can't quite understand the incomprehensible telegrams from his London editors, Boot eventually gets the big story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evelyn Waugh was already the author of four peppery comic novels, when he accepted an assignment to cover the Italo-Ethiopian War for a London newspaper. The enduring result of that assignment was Waugh's fifth novel, &lt;i&gt;Scoop&lt;/i&gt; a scathing satirical assault on the newspaper business and its war correspondents, as well as on Waugh's usual suspects, the British upper classes. In truth, he spares no one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;With this book, England's wittiest novelist sets a new standard for comic extravaganza....The one real message concerning &lt;i&gt;Scoop&lt;/i&gt; is that it is thoroughly enjoyable, uproariously funny, and that everyone should get a copy at once.&amp;quot;--&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Urban malice as bright and sharp as tin; it is not only delightful but true.&amp;quot;--&lt;i&gt;The New Republic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ingenious, satirical, extremely funny. &lt;i&gt;Scoop&lt;/i&gt; is entertaining reading all through, with more than a single good laugh or chuckle to the page.&amp;quot; --&lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>7</waitlist_count><updated>1263337796000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260827889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waugh: Scoop</name><id>12084556</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263164400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/12084556/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
