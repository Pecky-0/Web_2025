Since the weather looks a little better early in the weekend I also changed the date so get ready for a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;SATURDAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; meetup at Peter's Park! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Meetup dues are $3 per frenchie... I am out of town and I will not be there to collect so please make a mental note of what you owe and hopefully you can pay at a later date or as soon as I set up a way to pay online. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Your frenchie's canine brothers, sisters and friends are more than welcome to join us at the park! Please abide by the weight/size limits posted at the entrance to the small and larger dog entrances. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Get your meetup on and come join the fun, there is plenty of metered parking right on Washington St next to the park! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 For those that signed up for the Fenway Bark meetup on Sunday I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Thanks so much, Zeek!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zeek</member_name><member_id>49571912</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1351358030000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323881580000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>**Change Of Date &amp; Venue** October French Bulldog Meetup</name><id>44443852</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1351346400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/44443852/</event_url></item>
