This year's production is All's Well that Ends Well. The show starts at 8pm, but we need to get there early to get a decent spot- it gets very busy! Feel free to bring a blanket or lawn chair. We will get there early and have a picnic, then enjoy the show. Please bring what ever food/drinks that you would like to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are meeting outside the entrance at the Starbuck's on the corner of Bolyston and Tremont (across the street from Boylston Street T Stop). We will then walk down to the Bandstand area in the Common to get our spots to sit for the show. Please meet us at 6:30 so we can all walk over together- it gets very crowded near the Bandstand. If you are running late, please call me at 774 232 0000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for a fun night- we will probably grab some drinks after the show.&lt;/p&gt;
