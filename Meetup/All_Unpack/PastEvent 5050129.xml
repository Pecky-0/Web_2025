Those who came had a great time and once again, had fun playing with all the adorable pugs.  We hope more of you can join us next time.   I would still love to hear any comments and/or suggestions.  I have posted a few polls for you to take part in and also there are some new posts on the message board to check out about some events in the area that are coming up.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******A receipt of current vaccinations must be brought with you in order to enter the play area (kennel rules)*********  (this was not strictly enforced at the June meetup but, it's better safe then sorry since the owner of the kennel did request we have this on-hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donations will be accepted to help support this growing pug meetup!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you all and I look forward to playing again with all you pug lovers out there and your pups! =)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 2674662</member_name><member_id>2674662</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159636451000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Puggy Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-569</urlname><id>252667</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6900024414</group_lon><name>The Grafton Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1154196168000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Grafton Pug August Meetup</name><id>5050129</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1156611600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-569/events/5050129/</event_url></item>
