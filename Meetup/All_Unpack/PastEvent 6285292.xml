Rental boats are available and the trip is suitable for all levels of experience. Bring something along to eat, we will stop for lunch on the esplanade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy an outing on one of the most scenic sections of urban river in the country. In a small boat, paddlers get exceptional views of Frederick Law Olmstead's &amp;quot;Emerald Necklace&amp;quot; (including the Esplanade ? a great picnic spot!), plus local colleges (Harvard, MIT, and Boston University) and the unforgettable Boston skyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hourly canoe, kayak, and rowboat rental open this great resource to you at an affordable cost. Now, from our location in Artesani Park in Allston/Brighton, you can get out on the river, whether for a picnic lunch or relaxation after a week of work. This nine-mile stretch of river has no current, allowing painless round trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on foot from Harvard Square (MBTA Red Line): Follow JFK Street toward the river (pass Citizens Bank and Z Square Cafe on your left), then cross the river and immediately follow the bike path to the right. Remain on the bike path for one mile, passing through the tunnel under the Eliot Bridge (do not cross the bridge). Our green-roofed kiosk is 200 yards past the bridge on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by bus from Harvard Square: Take the #86 bus (Sullivan Square/Cleveland Circle) to Smith's Playground. Walk across the playground toward Harvard Stadium and onto Soldier's Field Road. Our green-roofed kiosk is across the road, 100 yards to the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by car from Boston: Take Storrow Drive West. Pass the Harvard Square exit and then get in the left lane. Bear left at the Rt. 2 interchange onto Soldier's Field Road, following the signs for Newton (do not cross the Eliot Bridge to Cambridge). Park in the first or second parking lot on the right, marked by the &amp;quot;boat rental&amp;quot; sign (no charge for parking). Look for our green-roofed kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by car from the west: Take the MassPike Eastbound to exit 18 (Cambridge/Allston, a left exit). Take the right branch of the ramp (Cambridge/Somerville), then stay as far left as possible and turn left at the second set of lights onto Storrow Drive West (immediately before crossing the river -- don't cross the river). After about 1.5 miles, bear left onto Soldier's Field Road, following the signs for Newton (do not cross the Eliot Bridge to Cambridge). Park in the first or second parking lot on the right, marked by the &amp;quot;boat rental&amp;quot; sign (no charge for parking). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.c.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOAT TYPE PER HOUR PER DAY &lt;br /&gt;standard canoe (2-3 adults, or 2 adults/2 kids) $15 $60 &lt;br /&gt;Tripper XL canoe (4-5 adults) $20 $80 &lt;br /&gt;Kevlar canoe (2-3 adults) $16 $64 &lt;br /&gt;ten-person canoe with guide (8-10 adults) $150 $600 &lt;br /&gt;single kayak (1 adult) $14 $56 &lt;br /&gt;fiberglass/Kevlar single kayak (1 adult) $16 $64 &lt;br /&gt;double kayak (2 adults) $16 $64 &lt;br /&gt;quad kayak (3-4 adults) $20 $80 &lt;br /&gt;Kevlar double kayak (2 adults) &lt;br /&gt;$18 $72 &lt;br /&gt;kid's kayak (age 6-12) $7 $28 &lt;br /&gt;paddleboat (1-2 adults) $16 $64 &lt;br /&gt;large paddleboat (3-4 adults) $18 $72 &lt;br /&gt;rowboat (1-4 adults) $16 $64 &lt;br /&gt;rowing shell (1 adult ? sculling experience required) $18 $72&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4219141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190040092000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188751603000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>boating in boston</name><id>6285292</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189866600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/6285292/</event_url></item>
