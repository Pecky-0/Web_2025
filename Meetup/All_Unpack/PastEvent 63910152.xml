Witchcraft seems always to have been with us, but the curious will ask: where did it come from and where is it going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists often define witchcraft as "the use of malevolent powers by psychic means without the need for ritual or charm". This may have been so for the days of the Inquisition but not for the contemporary western world where witches work magic through spells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This class provides a historical overview of how modern-day magic evolved from early man, the beliefs and customs of the Celts, and other ancient, Indo-European peoples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class starts at 6PM followed by Open Circle at 7:30PM&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346607115000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336484158000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - History of Witchcraft</name><id>63910152</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345413600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/63910152/</event_url></item>
