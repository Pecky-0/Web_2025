&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 A Resilience Circle is a small group of 10 – 20 people that works together to increase resilience during these challenging times. Circles have three purposes: learning, mutual aid, and social action.  Formerly known as "Common Security Clubs," these circles promise to move us beyond the good work we're doing in our own backyards and into effective group actions that help us all navigate the future more successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first time this training has been offered here in Maine.  We expect this session to be fully booked so please reserve your space as soon as you think you can commit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this one-day session, Resilience Circle trainers will lead us through the basics of creating and supporting a group, the available materials for working with a group and ideas for moving forward.  Attendees will go home with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;greater confidence in their ability to convene and "hold space" for a small local group to work together on mutual support and resilience-building.&lt;/p&gt;
