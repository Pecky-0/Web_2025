  &lt;strong&gt;NEW STUFF:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie starts at 7:35, so let's meet at 7:00 under the marquis (outside the theater) if it's not raining, and inside the ticket lobby if it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you tonight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Dana&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, there, Movie Lovers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandi had thoughtfully planned a meetup for opening weekend of 
&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1810004624/info"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; at the IMAX, but if you couldn't make it, didn't want to spend the extra money, don't like IMAX movies, whatever, and still haven't seen HP and want to, I'm organizing an encore meetup for it on Monday, August 8 (this coming Monday). We'll see the "regular" version, not the 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be my first meetup since the Twillins were born (and actually way before that since I was on bedrest for 3 months), and I just HAVE to see this last installment of a much-beloved movie series in the theater! Hubby Paul has seen this movie when I was out of town and said it's fantastic. So there you go. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #993300"&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #993300"&gt;In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry Potter who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE USUAL STUFF:&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;We'll meet right inside the theater ticket lobby doors and then I can buy us all discounted tickets ($8.00 each for FMM members and their guests). I also have $3 vouchers each for small sodas and small popcorns (can be used towards a larger size). Exact change makes me like you more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, guests are welcome, just be sure to include them in the RSVP so that I know who/how many to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep your RSVP as up-to-date as possible. And please call me if you're going to be late or need to change your RSVP after I close RSVPs on the site (2 hours before we meet). My cell is: 508/308-4897. I'm also good for directions if you get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the movie, we'll head to Unos or Fridays to chat about the movie (and just chat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;I'll update the time a few days before the meetup, so keep an eye on your email!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Dana
