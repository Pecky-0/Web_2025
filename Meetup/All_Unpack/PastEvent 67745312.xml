&lt;p&gt;Hildy will be kind enough to teach those who aren't familiar with the game. National Mah Jongg League rules will be played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is being cross-posted with Salem Social Cards. Please, if you are a member of both groups, only RSVP on one account. If you are already signed up to attend through SSC, you can feel free to note that in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damata's has a small parking lot in front on Bridge Street and additional parking to the side and behind the building. More spots are available on Ferry Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We request that when we hold Meetups in public establishments that everyone in attendance order at least one item or beverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1339811386000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1338847882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mah Jongg at Damatas</name><id>67745312</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339540200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/67745312/</event_url></item>
