Please arrive at 10:15 a.m. to meet and sit with other Natives in Row 7 on the Left side of the Church nearest the piano.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarendon Hill Presbyterian Church welcomes all people, faithful or seeking, to join in their shared journey of faith. They are a small but growing congregation. Their resources may be limited but their imagination and desires are not.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pastor Karl Gustafson will bless the Red Sox Natives and the upcoming 2010 Red Sox season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the conclusion of services (about 11:45 am) we will walk 3 short blocks to the Teele Square Cafe for an informal breakfast. Cost is what you eat and drink. We will order at counter and take over a window table. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Church is located near the Davis Square Red Line (Exit Holland Street, walk up hill to Teele Square Cafe, to Curtis Street 3 blocks to corner of Powderhouse Blvd.) about a 15 minute walk.  Resident Parking rules in Somerville are not in force on Sundays. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some useful links; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.clarendonhillchurch.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.teelesquarecafe.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be inviting several other groups to join us.
