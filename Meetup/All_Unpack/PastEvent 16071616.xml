I am a GIGANTIC Bloco AfroBrazil fan which is apparent because each time this group parties, I place it on the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/calendar/16070298/"&gt;Portuguese &lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonOnyxbirds/calendar/16013105"&gt;Onyxbirds travelers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/nightlife-421/calendar/16071331/"&gt;Happy Hour&lt;/a&gt; Meetup calendars because it always exceeds expectation. Let's pack the place again, because the more the merrier and also your presence will convince Ryles to keep the party on their schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="http://www.rylesjazz.com/dining.cfm"&gt;Ryles Dinner Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're also welcome to just come for the fun without the dinner. Get there when you can. Don't be shy...Say hi, to the friendly folks seated in the dining area at the tables against the wall, to the right of the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must be at least 21&lt;/b&gt; but you don't have to drink, just enjoy each others company and an AMAZING! show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil is a percussion ensemble that always puts on a spectacular show combining traditional Brazilian grooves like Samba and Axé with Funk, Rock, Jazz and even Hip Hop; add to this, AMAZING Brazilian singer, Ju Marciano's sultry vocal skills and beauty as well as talented and beautiful  dancers and you got a recipe for FUN, Brazilian style!! Wear your dance shoes or socks and leave your worries at the door!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your friends....I guarantee a funtastic time, that is if you like your music strong and your party loud. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free Brazilian Beginner Forró and Axé dance lessons and performances from 8 PM until 9:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcus and Bloco AfroBrazil turn up the heat and the sound at 9:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the drumming, singing and dancing start, group conversation is difficult. Let's just enjoy the party!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.afrobrazil.org/index.php?CLm=01&amp;amp;CLd=25&amp;amp;CLy=2011&amp;amp;c_num=AB&amp;amp;PHPSESSID=5bb25289aa5b035028673dc4860878d8"&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.movesandvibes.com"&gt;Moves and Vibes Dance Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://brazildanceryles.eventbrite.com/?ref=eivte&amp;amp;invite=NjUxNjgxL2lubmFhbmdlbDE3QGhvdG1haWwuY29tLzA%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=eb_email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=invite&amp;amp;utm_term=respondhere"&gt;Purchase tickets here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER - THANK YOU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Points West:&lt;br /&gt;Take I-90 (Mass Pike) to Exit 18 bearing right toward Allston/Cambridge.
