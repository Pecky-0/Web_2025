It was a good change from nice weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of nice weather, this Saturday has been forcasted to be a nice one, so come join us. All are welcome whether this is your 1st time or 50th time. Skill level does not matter. We play to have fun, exercise, meet new people, and for a little bit of competitiveness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Alewife station (redline) head toward Rindge Ave. to the Stadium lights, find the turf field w/ grand stands and we'll be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223751123000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222878511000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SAT - 2PM - FLAG FOOTBALL - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>8872690</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223143200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8872690/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/a/8/global_5593960.jpeg</photo_url></item>
