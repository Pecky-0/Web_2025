&lt;p&gt;Join NHCer Kevin, at a happy hour event&amp;nbsp;where people will discuss the upcoming Festival.&amp;nbsp; Several other groups from the area will be invited. You are welcome to invite any groups you may be affiliated with and bring as many friends as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 8pm people will have the option of migrating over from the happy hour social event to "The Grove" across the street at 71 Orange Street, where Kevin will give a short presentation (estimate of roughly 20 minutes.) about the acts coming to this years festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Happy hour portion will be at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Restaurant&amp;nbsp; (&lt;a href="http://www.rednewhaven.com/"&gt;http://www.rednewhaven.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly known as "Fosters", Red changed ownership and got a face lift over the winter.&amp;nbsp; They are now closed on Mondays, but since this event is on a Wednesday we will be able to meet there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Specials will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$5 House Wine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$5 Well Drinks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$3 Red Stripes or Bud Lights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Snacks will be put out for your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red is also expecting to have some live music starting at 7pm if that peaks your interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin will host this meetup and can be reached at 203-785-9066 (please leave a message if he is unable to answer).&amp;nbsp; AJ will be lending assistance in hosting this meetup and can be reached at 315-345-9348 (texting is also fine for me).&lt;/p&gt;
