I ran this event last year and it was 29 degrees and those who showed up froze.  If it's this cold this year, I'll cancel earlier in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening day at the Frog Pond is November 19. The Mayor will be there, some professional skaters will be there, there'll be some demonstrations, etc., plus admission is free this night.  It all starts at 5:30 p.m. which is kind of early for some so I thought we could meet at 6:30 p.m., watch a little, skate a little and then get something to eat at Chau Chow City in Chinatown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI the Frog Pond (www.bostoncommonfrogpond.org) isn't actually a pond for those of you who don't know.  It's just an outdoor rink that's frozen from underneath.  I know some people don't skate on ponds for fear of ruining their blades.  Also, if you don't have skates they do rent them.  It was $8.00 last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This location is T accessible by Park Street on the red and green lines.  If you are driving you can pay to park at the Boston Common Garage or drive around the Public Gardens no more than three times and you should get a metered spot.  (I always get one there.)  Just be aware if the meters go until 8:00 p.m. instead of 6:00 p.m. or that the metered spots don't turn residential after 6:00 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm giving the option to RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot;.  Please update your RSVP if your plans change.  I'll also be combining this event with the Social Fun group too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will meet at the Frog Statues.
