Let's get dressed up 80's style (optional) and enjoy each other's company while we dip our way though a 3 Course Meal.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost will be $35 per person (plus tax and tip) and does &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; include any drinks.  Please bring cash as it will make it easier to spit the bill at the end of the evening.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made reservations for 20 people and any changes to the reservation must by made by February 22nd if we don't want to be charged a &amp;quot;large party fee&amp;quot;, therefore I'm going to need your RSVP by February 21st.  Sorry!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you see you there because it's going to be &amp;quot;Like, Totally Awesome Dude!!!!&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&lt;a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/framingham" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.meltingpot...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just inside the doors.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235788214000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234023912000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Melt into the 80's</name><id>9693311</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235606400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/9693311/</event_url></item>
