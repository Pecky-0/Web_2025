The Connecticut Valley Buddhist Film Festival is sponsored by the Buddhist Faith Fellowship of Connecticut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Film Festival 2009 &amp;amp; 2010 includes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baraka&lt;/b&gt; - December&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visitor&lt;/b&gt; – January. This 2009 film did not get nearly enough attention- even though Richard Jenkins received Best Actor nomination for his performance.  The theme of film is &amp;quot;just connect&amp;quot;. It is a beautiful story of what can happen when lives intersect and people are willing and able to drop their story lines- and &amp;quot;just connect.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nobody Loves Me&lt;/b&gt; - February &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cherry Blossoms&lt;/b&gt; – March. This film is directed by Doris Dorrie, a German Buddhist film maker- who also directed How to Cook Your Life. It takes place in Japan during very special cherry blossom season. It deals with life/death with Buddhist concepts subtly interwoven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you can join us and explore Buddhist filmmaking.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Senpai Daishin</member_name><member_id>5221830</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259282454000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Buddhists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>buddhism-563</urlname><id>797062</id><group_lat>41.5499992371</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6600036621</group_lon><name>Buddhist Faith Fellowship in Middletown, Ct</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254492001000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buddhist Film Festival 2009 in Middletown - How to Cook Your Life</name><id>11528477</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259109000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/buddhism-563/events/11528477/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/6/global_11010758.jpeg</photo_url></item>
