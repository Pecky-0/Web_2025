The fire tower on this small, relatively easy mountain has been dismantled, but fine views are still available in several directions, and metamorphosed strata make the summit ledge geologically interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most of the hikes that I organize, I have never hiked on these trails or climbed to these summits. I did all of my research using a trail guide, a trail map, or the Internet. The link(s) below provide an overview of where we will be going and include topographic maps of the area. You should become familiar with this information since you are ultimately responsible for your own safety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=12614" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for more information about this peak from Peakbagger.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you plan to participate in this event you must answer the questions for you and any guests when you RSVP YES or MAYBE - if you don't answer them your RSVP will be removed by the organizer.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP up-to-date - if your plans change please be considerate and update your RSVP as soon as possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have a ride when you RSVP please only RSVP MAYBE until you have a confirmed ride - once you have a confirmed ride you can change your RSVP to YES. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All MAYBE RSVPs will be changed to NO three days before the event so people who might be on the WAITING LIST have an opportunity to participate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are welcome on this hike provided they are under voice control, you bring a leash in case you need to use it, and you bring a copy of their most recent rabies vaccination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trip Summary:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We will follow the Stinson Mountain Trail from the parking area to the summit and then follow the same route in reverse to return.  &lt;b&gt;On this moderate pace trip we will hike about 3.6 miles and climb about 1,400 feet. It is considered INTERMEDIATE because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the objective of this trip is to enjoy ourselves as we climb as a group, your safety, and the safety of the others in the group, is the most important thing. If you underestimate the demands of this trip, or overestimate your skills and abilities, you may put yourself and/or others at risk - consider this before you decide if you are going to participate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker in the group. If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you. Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ANY questions about your ability to participate in and complete this entire trip please contact me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Reaching the summit is optional, getting down is mandatory.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;(Ed Viesturs on the dangers of mountaineering)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dangerous weather conditions will cancel this hike - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Rumney&amp;amp;state=NH&amp;amp;site=GYX&amp;amp;lat=43.8053&amp;amp;lon=-71.8131" target="_blank"&gt;Click here for the current weather forecast for this trip.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing and Equipment:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Below is a list describing the minimum clothing and equipment required to participate in this event.

You will need to bring any medications or medical supplies that you may need during the trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We will begin this hike at 10:00 AM from the Stinson Mountain Trail parking area located in Rumney, NH.
