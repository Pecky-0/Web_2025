Want to show off your best potluck dish? This event comes at the request of many SoJusters who likely identify as bibliophiles and foodies. But you don't have to to join the fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOOK SWAP&lt;br /&gt;Bring 3 or more lightly used books. Leave with the same number! All genres welcomed - remember this is a group of like-minded progressives, so leave your Ann Coulter at home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children welcomed! We'll set up a separate table for childrens' books. Please indicate in your RSVP that you plan to bring childrens' books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POTLUCK&lt;br /&gt;Vegan, vegetarian and carnist dishes welcomed. Please list all ingredients on a card so SoJusters with allergy/dietary concerns can safely enjoy themselves. There is a kitchen with a microwave - there is no oven/stove. Be creative! We love variety and don't mean a variety of chips &amp;amp; salsa. Beverages welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCHEDULE&lt;br /&gt;6:00-7:00pm Browse books and eat!&lt;br /&gt;7:00-8:00pm Book swap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARKING&lt;/b&gt; - if you're driving you may need to circle quit a bit to find a parking spot or park in a garage (I've heard the one by Harvard Kennedy School is the least expensive). If you'd like to drop off your casserole/books and then go circle contact us ahead of time so you get my cell #. We'll meet you at the curb. ~Robbie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/b&gt; We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Socializing for Justice - www.sojust.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this &amp;quot;Movement Moment&amp;quot;.
