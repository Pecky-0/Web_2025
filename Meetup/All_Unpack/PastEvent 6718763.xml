Highly acclaimed, winning multiple prizes at Cannes,  and now quietly forgotten- Kendall presents them in new prints for one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red Balloon is one of the most beloved of classic childhood fantasies. Shot in the picturesque Menilmontant neighborhood of Paris, it is a tender and charming story of a little boy (Pascal Lamorisse, the director's 6-year-old son) befriended by a large red balloon. The amazingly expressive balloon wreaks havoc on the boy's daily routine, following him everywhere. Winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prize, it also won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay, a rare honor for a short film, not to mention foreign and dialogue-free. Director Albert Lamorisse's earlier White Mane (Crin-Blanc) is the story of a boy's love for a wild horse that only he can tame. Shot in the wild and lonely marshy region of southern France.        Kendall description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red Balloon&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;A lonely young boy discovers a solitary bright red balloon and the two form an instant bond of friendship.  Wherever the boy goes, the balloon is not far behind.  When the boy gets into trouble at school, the balloon comes to his rescue.  The boy?s new found happiness appears to be short lived when a gang of other boys are attracted to the balloon, their intentions being are far from friendly... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review&lt;br /&gt;Le Ballon rouge is a rare gem of French cinema, a captivating short film which relates a simple tale of childhood innocence and fantasies, unmarred by false sentimentality.  Although it is a short film, which manages to avoid using dialogue for the most part, it has a surprisingly great deal to say about human nature, showing both the best and worst of the human condition in a profoundly moving minimalist lucidity.   Most of all, it is probably one of the most successful films to capture the essence of childhood, or rather to present a child's view of the world that is both convincing and engaging. FillmsdeFrance.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Mane&lt;br /&gt;In Camargue, a fisher boy tries to tame a wild stallion.&lt;br /&gt;A glorious little film that is as fresh and as exciting today as when it first charmed the crowds in 1953. Lamorisse's genius is to capture the special moments of the everyday; thus a scene of a tiny child seeing a turtle, perhaps for the first time, becomes as exciting and as vivid as a fight between two wild horses (censored in the first British prints).  Camera Journal      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most beautiful films ever made... a piece of visual poetry.
