&lt;p&gt;Worship begins at 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. It is Palm Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please arrive by 10:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. to meet and sit with other Natives and drinking buddies in Row 7 on the left side of the Church nearest the piano. The Clarendon Hill Presbyterian Church welcomes all people, faithful or seeking, to join in their shared journey of faith. They are a small congregation. Their resources may be limited but their imagination and desires are not. Pastor Karl Gustafson will bless the Red Sox Natives and the upcoming 2012 Red Sox season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of services (about 11:30 a.m.) we will walk or car pool to Davis Square or Ball Square for an informal breakfast. Cost is what you eat and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church is located near the Davis Square Red Line (Exit Holland Street, walk up hill to Teele Square, to Curtis Street&amp;nbsp;3 blocks to corner of Powderhouse Blvd. about a 12-14 minute walk. Resident parking rules in Somerville are not in force&amp;nbsp;on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
