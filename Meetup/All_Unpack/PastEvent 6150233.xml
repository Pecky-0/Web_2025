I would encourage you that have RSVPd or were considering it to still get together and swim!  I was in there on monday and it was fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next weekend I will be at the Chicago Tri so no walden swim for me, but if someone would like to step up as assistant organizer you can arrange a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541918000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186637773000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walden Swim</name><id>6150233</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187445600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/6150233/</event_url></item>
