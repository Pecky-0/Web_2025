<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Mingle with friends old and new at the Spring 2013 kickoff gathering, &lt;br /&gt;

which will offer an overview of the forthcoming season of events &lt;br /&gt;

(including information about a new series of writing workshops, &lt;br /&gt;

readings, seminars &amp;amp; experimental walking tours) and a preview of our &lt;br /&gt;

Phone-A-Poem installation. The exhibit features recordings made during &lt;br /&gt;

the 25-year existence of the popular Cambridge-based poetry hotline, &lt;br /&gt;

Phone-A-Poem. Founded in 1976 by Peter Payack (and later edited by &lt;br /&gt;

Roland Pease), Phone-A-Poem's archive includes recordings by Allen &lt;br /&gt;

Ginsberg, Donald Hall, Jane Kenyon, Denise Levertov, Ifeanyi Menkiti, &lt;br /&gt;

Marge Piercy, James Tate and August Wilson. The Poetry Room has also &lt;br /&gt;

commissioned a series of new answering-machine poems by recent (and &lt;br /&gt;

upcoming) readers in WPR programs, including Dan Beachy-Quick, Charles &lt;br /&gt;

Bernstein, Forrest Gander, Dorothea Lasky, Paul Legault and Anne &lt;br /&gt;

Waldman. Food and beverages will be served, catered by Crema. Come &lt;br /&gt;

one, come all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Chenevert</member_name><member_id>76210242</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1360289558000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360087474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SEASON KICK-OFF GATHERING &amp; PHONE-A-POEM INSTALLATION</name><id>103153162</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1360278000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/103153162/</event_url></item>
