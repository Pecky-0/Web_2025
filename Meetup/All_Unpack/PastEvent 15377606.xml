Using the wisdom teaching of the ages Father Peter will teach about how to practically heal emotional wounds and grow in spiritual consciousness.   When we are more connected into the great love and light of God, we have the courage and energy to approach painful parts of ourselves; in turn we become more emotionally healthy and have more space for God. When the spiritual healing and emotional healing processes are joined, they create a powerful momentum for transformation of our bodies, minds, hearts and lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, November 12, 7:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Up Your Spiritual Eyes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is said that until we see with spiritual sight, we are blind. Opening up our eyes takes courage and a willingness to see beyond what we already know. In this seminar, you will be given the tools to not only open your eyes and look, but to truly see.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
