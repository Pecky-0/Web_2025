We have so many members and everyone is so friendly...I know it's not necessary for me to come in order for people to have fun!  &lt;br /&gt;This place has gotten some great reviews and I overheard some people last week raving about it.  If you are not into sushi, never fear...they have hibatchi as well.  The menu looks fantastic and prices seem reasonable for a Japanese restaurant.  Is there someone who is willing to call the restaurant ahead of time to reserve a table?  &lt;br /&gt;I am using the new waiting list feature for this event so if it fills up, try to add yourself to the waiting list.  Let me know how it works out!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Table should be under Ethnic Dining</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226628320000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225343486000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kumo Sushi and Hibatchi Japanese Bar</name><id>9059602</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226448000000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/9059602/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/c/global_2456236.jpeg</photo_url></item>
