I plan to offer night sky viewing first if the weather permits then move to an indoor presentation to address new findings about the Solar System and Exoplanets plus review starhopping skills learned during the Thursday, January 10th workshop. Please call Tower Hill to let them know that you will be returning for the second workshop so they can track who will be attending. It also allows Aldrich to know how many telescopes to bring and setup for outdoor viewing. Hope to see you there - clear skies!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim J.
