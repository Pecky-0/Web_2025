This for experienced trail runners who are used to staying safe on rough terrain.  If you're not sure if this run is for you, just send me a message and we can talk to help you decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 2-part run - come for just part 1 or for both parts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1: Moderate pace, rough/rocky terrain, ~200 ft climbing sometimes steeply, 4 miles, ~1 hour. We will start at Houghton's Pond and take the skyline trail to Buck Hill, where we will enjoy sweeping views of Boston, the Harbor Islands, and surroundings. We will take the skyline back to the cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 2: If you still want more! Faster pace, rough/rocky terrain, ~300 ft of climbing, often steep, 4 miles, ~1 hour. We will take Skyline North over Hancock Hill to the Great Blue Hill, climbing the viewing tower for... more views. We'll also check out a nice western outlook near the summit, where we will contemplate the possibility of extending the run out to Little Blue Hill, which tacks on a mile and a few hundred feet of steep climbing on the return (each group member has a veto vote on that one). We'll return along Skyline South.  Take a swim in Houghton Pond when you are done, if you like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at Houghton Pond, exit 3 off I-93. Take a right off the exit, then a right at Hillside St. Turn right into the Houghton Pond parking lot, then go left all the way to the far northern corner of the parking lot. Type 42.210549,-71.095796 into Google Maps to see the exact spot. Any questions, just send me a message or post a comment.  I'll send an email with my cell number to the RSVPs closer to the run.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Orange backpack</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251115538000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250810401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trail run - Blue Hills Skyline</name><id>11160978</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250942400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/11160978/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/6/global_8768566.jpeg</photo_url></item>
