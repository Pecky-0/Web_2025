It is rumored to be the second most hiked mountain in the world (#1 is Mt. Fuji in Japan).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to be in decent shape to ascend the mountain. You must wear good hiking shoes. You must have changes of clothes and expect wet weather. Trekking poles are useful. And of course plenty of water and snacks with lunch for the top. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much damage was sustained during the Ice Storms of this winter. They are clearing it as I write this, but will check with the park rangers when we meet up at the visitor's center as to what is hikable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect this to be a 6 - 7 hour trek - not inlcuding the drive there or back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its thousands of acres of protected highlands, 3,165-ft. Mt. Monadnock was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1987. There are 40 miles of maintained foot trails, many of which lead to the bare rock summit through unique alpine vegetation. Unsurpassed 100-mile views to points in all six New England states are the reward for a climb. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main trail up Monadnock starts at the end of a paved road. Trail information and maps are posted near the Visitor Center at the start of the trail. The Monadnock Visitor Center offers interesting exhibits on various aspects of the park's history, ecology and trails. Monadnock State Park is a carry in/carry out park site; please carry home what you carry in. Remember there are no facilities available on the mountain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The park is open year-round, with recreational use during daylight hours only. Admission is $4 for adults&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are pets allowed at Monadnock State Park? &lt;b&gt;Pets are not permitted&lt;/b&gt; in the park or on the mountain. See NH State Parks Pets Policy for more information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please print and bring with you the trail map.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhstateparks.org/library/pdf/monadnockhiking.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Monadnock Hiking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;Route 124&lt;br /&gt;Jaffrey, NH 03452&lt;br /&gt;Phone: 603-532-8862&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Monadnock State Park&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Route 3 (Northbound):&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 3 north to exit 7 in New Hampshire.
