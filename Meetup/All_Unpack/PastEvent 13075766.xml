The exhibition features 100 original artworks, including drawings, cartoons and storyboards that illustrate Henson's talent as a storyteller and visionary. Among the variety of exhibition objects are puppets and television and movie props, photographs of Henson and his collaborators at work and original video productions, including excerpts from Henson's early career and experimental films.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the museum at 12:30, visit the Henson exhibit and perhaps poke around the rest of the museum while we're there - I've never been to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Wow! so much interest. I'm bumping up the max number of people. If we fill up again this quickly, I will change the Maybes to No earlier, but I will warn you all first to give you a chance to change yourselves to Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2: I'll be switching all maybes to nos on May 14 and turning off the maybe option going forward to allow more definite yeses to come. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michelle</member_name><member_id>2132838</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275777181000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270305766000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Muppets!</name><id>13075766</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275755400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/13075766/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/global_2910306.jpeg</photo_url></item>
