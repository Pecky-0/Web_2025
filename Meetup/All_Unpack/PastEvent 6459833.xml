They are very energetic, versatile and sound great!!  Their following are people ranging in age from 20's-40's... Perfect for our Beantown and Beyond group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See some of their clips from this past summer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eolWEAfm7wc" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRrMUOZ0v-U" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw_JYWDF5gI" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going with a friend, so if you'd like to join us.  Just RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and we'll see you there.&lt;br /&gt;We can get some appetizers when we all get there, because the band doesn't start until 9:30.  The cover charge is only $5.00.  I'll give my contact info out to those who say Yes, on the morning of the event, so you can call me when you get there to meet up with our group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamies' Grill and Pub website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jamiesgrill.com/marshfield.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://jamiesgrill.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamies is only a 35 minute drive from Newton, where 128 and Mass Pike intersect.  And, it is right off of Rt 3 on Rt 139 (Plain St), in Marshfield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypercane's wesite:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hypercane.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hypercane....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Hypercane:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This versatile South Shore based rock band brings a showcase of raw talent and musicianship to every gig. HYPERCANE blends heavy rhythm with powerful melodic vocals. They perform with a tightness and precision that is unrivaled by any other band we've seen on the Massachusetts bar scene. The crowd is visibly drawn into the music and energy and always left cheering for &amp;quot;one more song&amp;quot; when the lights come on at the end of the night. These guys have even been known to attract some well-known special guests who stop in to jam on a few songs with the band sometimes (.... like Aerosmith, who all live in the Marshfield/Duxbury area). Check it out and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed!!!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;More Band Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/hypercanerocks" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beantown and Beyond</member_name><member_id>4494456</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192469852000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191205436000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hypercane - cover band at Jamies' Grill and Pub, Marshfield, MA</name><id>6459833</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192233600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/6459833/</event_url></item>
