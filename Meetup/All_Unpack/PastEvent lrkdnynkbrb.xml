<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>July's meeting is still being worked on. I'd like some ideas from the group. Would you like another local CFI to go over anything? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Course Osh is coming up and Red Bull is behind us. Would love a slide show of Red Bull from the attendee's and some stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might still be room for any last minute additions to the FPA Airventure Hangar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young Eagles update from Ed Murphy will also be available with lots of pictures. Dick Maki did a wonderful job making a video of our Young Eagles for the Lancaster/Sterling Cable TV. We can show that at the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Fly Often and Fly Safe.&lt;br /&gt;See you all soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, food at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where else can you have this much excitement for $25 bucks a year?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fly Often and Fly Safe, &lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Scales</member_name><member_id>6873008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279225648000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275768911000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association EAA Chapter 1454 Monthly Meetup</name><id>lrkdnynkbrb</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279058400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/13708956/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/7/6/global_8567238.jpeg</photo_url></item>
