Before his kite-flying days, young Franklin lived a humble Puritan life as a voracious reader, resourceful inventor, a printer's apprentice and with a sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us on a trip back to Colonial Boston to celebrate the life of Benjamin Franklin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets for this tour are $12 ($5 for card-carrying &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/join/member/" target="_blank"&gt;Boston By Foot members&lt;/a&gt;, see our &lt;a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to join).
