We will be showing it on Saturday night, Nov 7th for those that are interested in viewing it. Come see it with us and get a preview of what you will see in just a little over a week from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful scenery and we would love to share it with all of you. We will have some finger food and a glass of wine along with some fine Irish tunes. This should help to get our holiday off to a great start!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also be celebrating Jeanne's birthday that evening. So come join us as we help her to usher in HER new year! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JEANNE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is interested in joining us, whether you are coming to Ireland or not, feel free to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Terri&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>White house with red brick front...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257813826000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257245414000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beautiful Ireland!!!</name><id>11780383</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257640200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/11780383/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/1/0/global_11625856.jpeg</photo_url></item>
