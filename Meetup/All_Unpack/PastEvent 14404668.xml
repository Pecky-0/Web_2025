A little bit less I'll say. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting up at Louie B's on the shores of Lake Congamond. The lake is on the border of CT and Mass. Crabby Joe's is close by so we'll check that out to. Stephanie is docking her boat with us so we'll be spending some time on the water. How great is that! Thanks Stephanie! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is weather dependent so check back for any updates. We'll also be having this event one more time in August. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later at night Louie B's has a nightclub there so we may check that seen out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time is set for 1pm but people can come anytime in the afternoon. Give me a call when you arrive and I'll guide you into the group. 203-599-1120&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring yourself and any friends that want to hang out to, all are invited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boating Fun, Summer Night = a Full Summer 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew</member_name><member_id>12663646</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283101026000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281641941000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boating Fun - Summer Nights </name><id>14404668</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283014800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/14404668/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/3/f/global_15943855.jpeg</photo_url></item>
