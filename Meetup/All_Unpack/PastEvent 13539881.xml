Invented in the late 1940s, holography is best known for industrial and commercial applications ranging from credit card security to product packaging. Many artists have experimented with holography's creative properties since the late 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Museum's collection chronicles the history of the science and technology of holography, capturing both the fine art that represents new and unusual expressions in media as well as holography's industrial and commercial applications. Today, individuals all over the world work in the medium and extend its imaging abilities beyond solely replicating three-dimensional objects. The exhibition features works by several world-renown artists, including Margaret Benyon, Rudie Berkhout, Melissa Crenshaw, Setsuko Ishii, Marie Andree Cossette, and John Kaufman.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/exhibitions/holography.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://web.mit.edu/mu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave Kelleher</member_name><member_id>1381167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277855453000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Digital Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-arts</urlname><id>303063</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Digital Arts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274329137000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MIT Museum Visit: ~ Holography Exhibit ~</name><id>13539881</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275840000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-arts/events/13539881/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/2/global_2958562.jpeg</photo_url></item>
