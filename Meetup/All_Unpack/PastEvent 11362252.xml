And while what you see is a complete surprise until the lights go down, we can tell you that last year's series included sneaks of such Oscar-winning fare as &lt;u&gt;Slumdog Millionaire&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;Man on Wire&lt;/u&gt;.  The Sneak Preview on September 12 was &lt;u&gt;Bright Star&lt;/u&gt;, a film by Jan Champion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some selections are meant to stretch the viewer’s perspective, some are meant to expand the viewer’s geopolitical horizons, and always to inform... New cinema is viewed as a peephole into new territory, whether it is cinematic, thematic, political or geographic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is a critic: One of the program’s distinctive features is the opportunity for members to review films and to refer films to each other. This is a great way to deepen your film experience and connect with other cinephiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John will be sipping coffee across the street at the Panera Bread starting at 9:150 am to meetup with folks so that we can sit together.  Due to the discussion after the film, there will be no formal meetup following Talk Cinema.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252874650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harlan Jacobson's Talk Cinema</name><id>11362252</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254664800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/11362252/</event_url></item>
