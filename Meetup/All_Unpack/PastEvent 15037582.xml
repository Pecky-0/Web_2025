The place has terrific and reasonably-priced luncheon specials like chicken with ginger &amp;amp; scallions or spicy peanut beef served with miso soup, a spring roll, and steamed rice.  Check out the full menu at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seibar.com/Docs/Luncheon.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Sei Bar Luncheon Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The menu also features Sushi and other Asian Cuisine such as tempura and several vegetarian options as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, we'll either split the check fairly or get separate checks for attendees.  The restaurant is a few blocks from the George Street building, but those of us on the hill will probably want to drive or carpool.  Although the restaurant does not have a parking lot, I have always been able to find street parking on Columbus Road, a side street right next to the Restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at: rich.kelley@tufts.edu.  I hope to see you at Sei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm regards,&lt;br /&gt;Rich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Tufts Faculty-Staff Meet-up sign on my table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287752470000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286483022000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thai Food Thursday</name><id>15037582</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287680400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/15037582/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/c/3/global_18555779.jpeg</photo_url></item>
