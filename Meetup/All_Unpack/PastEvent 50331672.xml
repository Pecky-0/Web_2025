 &lt;br /&gt;

In roaring twenties Chicago, Roxie Hart, an ambitious chorus girl, murders her lover. She then convinces her gullible husband, Amos, that her lover was in fact a burglar. Amos agrees to take the rap until the police c&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;onvince him that the burglar was in fact Roxie's lover.... Thus, Roxie goes to jail and joins another famous stage performer and murderess, Velma Kelly. Both Roxie and Velma are headline hunters seeking to capitalize on pre-trial publicity for the sake of acquittal and stage careers with the help of their lawyer, Billy Flynn. &lt;br /&gt;
