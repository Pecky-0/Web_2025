<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our September 13, 2010 speaker will be Gus Bigos of Evergreen Innovation Partners.  Gus will review trends in open innovation at consumer product companies, key attributes of successful new products, pros and cons of various routes to commercialization, including (but not only) a discussion of the approach at Evergreen IP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Evergreen IP recently entered into an agreement with Clorox, under which they solicit, screen, and present new product concepts for Clorox under a standard licensing deal. Gus will explain what Clorox is looking for and how the standard licensing deal works.&lt;br /&gt;Under the new, standardized Clorox license agreement, Clorox pays the inventor a pre-defined royalty rate, depending on the development status of the invention and the deal includes minimum annual royalties, to avoid lengthy development and launch delays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you have new products that fit the Clorox brand, please contact Brian Abe (brian@evergreenip.com) or Gus Bigos  (gbigos@evergreenip.com). &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Arrive as early as 6:30 to network with others.  The meeting starts promptly at 7:00.
