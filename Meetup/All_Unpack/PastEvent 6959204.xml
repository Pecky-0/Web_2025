We'll meet in the parking lot where the Bank of America (formerly Fleet Bank) is at 10:00 a.m., wave signs for an hour or more and then head out to neighborhoods in Vernon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the handouts. We have the yard signs. We have DVD's. We need Ron Paul supporters in the streets getting this material to the uninformed masses.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a silver car with "Ron Paul" on the door. Depending on the turnout, some of us may want to move to the other side of the intersection (on the Denny's side) - look for the signs near Tri-City you'll find us.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200938799000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Time is running out!
