<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>January 6th's meetup will focus primarily on characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before joining us consider the following questions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) What makes a memorable character?&lt;br /&gt;2.) What are different methods of characterization?&lt;br /&gt;3.) How much detail should be given about a character?  How much information should be withheld from the reader?&lt;br /&gt;4.) What different types of characters are there?&lt;br /&gt;5.) When are archetypes and stereotypes beneficial? When are they harmful?&lt;br /&gt;6.) What makes a character believable?  How important are dialogue, dialect, names, physical traits in building a believable character?&lt;br /&gt;7.) What effects to contradictions in a character have on the audience/reader?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just a few questions, but please consider bringing your own questions to the meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also be discussing John and Rita's work at this meetup.  They have both downloaded files in the file section of our meetup page.  Please try to read their work before coming to the meetup and offer some helpful feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week, I have also changed the location of the meetup to a more central location than Cambridge.  The easiest way to this Borders is take the Red Line train to Downtown Crossing.  Two other members of the meetup suggested it.  We can give it a try and if it doesn't work we can find another location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be there trying to save seats and reading</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232499124000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229476044000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Characters Wanted:  20-30 Something Creative Writers of Boston January Meetup</name><id>9350041</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231286400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/9350041/</event_url></item>
