Fifty-two years running for New Haven, and three for the NHC. Don't fancy parades, you say? Well this ain't your grandpappy's St. Patrick's Day Parade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, the elected officials of this fair burg of ours, in their infinite wisdom, have long decreed that imbibing openly upon city streets is to be allowed on this festival of festivals (but no other day). So don't be shy! Pick your favorite poison, your means of conveyance for said poison (handbag, backpack, wagon, draft animal, spouse, etc.), and come on out to hoist to the saint. But wait, you say, St. Patrick's Day isn't until the 17th! Well and true enough, but in New Haven, we're so hardcore that we have a pre-St. Patrick's Day St. Patrick's Day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the celebration is not without its detractors...some say they abhor and revile the carousing and drunken singing, the yelling and the shouting, the breaking of glass and the defacement of public and private property with sundry bodily fluids. To that, I have no response...other than to say that this year, I promise not to sing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in years past, starting at 12:15 we'll be staking out the sidewalk in front of the Yale Art Gallery, for the administrators of that institution generously allow the public at large to use their facilities, free of charge (perhaps, ironically, hoping to avert enthusiastic artistic expression on the part of those who might otherwise see the outside wall of the gallery as one huge canvas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parade starts at 1pm, and don't forget, daylight savings starts on parade day this year (that's spring forward). Those driving should be able to find parking in the York Street garage. For more info on the parade, &lt;a href="http://www.stpatricksdayparade.org/" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.

And maybe a little yellow.
