It may be the biggest factor for folks in the beginning, but soon it becomes clear that other factors are equally or more important to our health; exercise, fresh air, clean water, loving relationships, faith, mental health and inner peace to name a few. At this potluck we will focus on “cleansing our minds” by watching the Abraham-Hicks DVD, “The Law of Attraction in Action”. This DVD teaches that we draw to ourselves what we mentally focus upon. Focus on illness, fear, being too busy, not having enough money, that relationship you don’t have, and that is what you get. To build health, loving relationships, a full bank account, ease and peace in your life, think and live as if you already have them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Migner&lt;br /&gt;Grateful Living&lt;br /&gt;Life Coach&lt;br /&gt;Oneness Blessing Giver&lt;br /&gt;978-635-9883&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mayallbepeaceful.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.mayallbepeaceful.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;andy@mayallbepeaceful.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posted by Mara &lt;a href="http://www.rawyum.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.rawyum.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237759320000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RawBoston</urlname><id>733136</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Raw Food Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236665586000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boxborough Potluck/DVD: Law of Attraction</name><id>9921756</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237415400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RawBoston/events/9921756/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/d/d/global_7620477.jpeg</photo_url></item>
