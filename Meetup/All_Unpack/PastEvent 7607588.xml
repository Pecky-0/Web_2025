This would be a great ride for some of the smaller scooters as well, so if you want to join in, Meet us at the Marriott in Newton or midway at the Arboretum entrance (125 the Arborway) at 2:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I'm sorry but I need to limit this ride to 30 members, I know you all want to come out on a beautiful Spring Sunday, but 13 of you will have to wait till next time.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Scooters and people walking in the Arboretum wearing motorcycle jackets - call me if you can't find us 617-584-4797</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207071720000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>I don't think I need to tell you why to come, if you luv scootin.. then this is for U!</why><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206557531000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ride to Arnold Arboretum</name><id>7607588</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206898200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/7607588/</event_url></item>
