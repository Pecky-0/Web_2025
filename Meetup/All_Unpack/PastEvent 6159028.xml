Route 111 (at Exit 5 off Rt. 3, Everett Turnpike), leads to the GOP event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will announce the exact meet-up location prior to the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring signs if you have them, but don't worry if you don't have signs or banners. The Nashua Ron paul Meetup Group will supply 35, 3 x 9 foot banners that we've made for this purpose. We have more events planned with these banners, so be sure to return them after the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronpaul.meetup.com/309/calendar/6152001/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronpaul.meetup.com/309/calendar/6152001/"&gt;http://ronpaul.meetup...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188182557000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186776565000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre BBQ Banner Blitz and Sign Wave</name><id>6159028</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187535600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6159028/</event_url></item>
