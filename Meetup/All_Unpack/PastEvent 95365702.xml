If you are a donor you will receive your invitation this week.  If you're not yet, remember you can donate up to the date of the event to be eligible to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll plan on carpooling from Starbucks in Dover.  I will be able to take up to 3 people in my car.  Is anyone else able to drive if need be?   If it's closer for you, you can meet us at Ruby's at around noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there, and thanks everyone of your support of the group!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll car pool/car train from the Starbucks parking lot at 11.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carrie Kelley</member_name><member_id>12068098</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1359596356000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Seacoast Knitters</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>seacoastknitters</urlname><id>642244</id><group_lat>43.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Knitters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355509871000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ruby's Lunch/The Yarn Sellar</name><id>95365702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359216000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/seacoastknitters/events/95365702/</event_url></item>
