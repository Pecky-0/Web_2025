<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Gosh, is it Tuesday already? I'm hosting a game day at my house in Concord, NH this coming Saturday, August 8, starting at noon and running until 8 pm or thereabouts. A month has passed since the last full-blown game day, so I'm looking forward to playing some meaty titles and knocking a game or two from my stack of titles to be reviewed. Games I'm most interested in playing include Automobile and new titles from Small Box Games. Lots of others from which to choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP with an arrival time if you're in. Suggest games that you want to play as that will help me decide which rules to review ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the host of the house</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric Martin</member_name><member_id>1979558</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252159290000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249440353000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gaming in Concord, NH</name><id>11038820</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249747200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/11038820/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/global_7561166.jpeg</photo_url></item>
