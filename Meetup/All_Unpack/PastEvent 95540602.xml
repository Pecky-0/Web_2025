<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Let's head to Mount Sunapee for a day of riding or skiing. In the 2011 &lt;em&gt;SKI&lt;/em&gt; Magazine Reader Survey Mount Sunapee was ranked #1 in the East for Grooming and #1 in the East for Snow.  While Mount Sunapee has been ranked with the best snow surfaces in the East for the past six seasons by &lt;em&gt;SKI&lt;/em&gt; Magazine readers, 2011 was the first year that Mount Sunapee was ranked #1 in the East for both Grooming and Snow, the two categories which make up overall snow surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Sunapee lives up to its tag line: Big Mountain - Best Snow - Your Backyard.  The resort offers over 1,500 feet of vertical, 66 trails and 11 lifts.  It is the closest big mountain to southern New Hampshire and eastern Massachusetts plus offers the best snow in the East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please post if you can give a ride or need a ride.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sue </member_name><member_id>2976623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357437341000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355672952000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Day of riding or skiing at Sunapee</name><id>95540602</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357398900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/95540602/</event_url></item>
