And it's back for your entertainment this holiday season at the Hartford Stage. Come join us for a wonderful evening of magic and holiday cheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete with flying ghosts, which soar across the stage, singing carolers and falling snow, the spirit of a Victorian Christmas is captured onstage. It's a holiday treat you won't want to miss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are in 3 price range...$58.00 for center...$40.00...center rear or side...$30.00 on the wing (very side of side of stage toward the back). Your choice is available. If I have 10 or more we will get a 10% discount. You should pay online thru Amazon at Have Fun Will Travel meetup site and I will purchase as a block to capture the discount. Again, however, it will be available for 10 or more tickets only.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the lobby at 7:30 pm.
