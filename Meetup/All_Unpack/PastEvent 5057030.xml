Don't worry if you are a chicken like me you will not have to sing.  Anyways Sky is a very nice restaurant in Sudbury MA and they have Karoakee every Thursday night starting at 9.  They have a full menu and of course great drinks.&lt;br /&gt;I have been many time and it is always fun.  Please RSVP quickly b/c the place gets packed and it is hard to get tables.  If I know in advance how many people to expect I will try and reserve tables.  Please RSVP even if you cannot come.  Thanks and I hope to see you all there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chris</member_name><member_id>3910727</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1156883203000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialnetworking</urlname><id>251346</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Social Networking</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1154528882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karoakee if you dare....</name><id>5057030</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1155254400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialnetworking/events/5057030/</event_url></item>
