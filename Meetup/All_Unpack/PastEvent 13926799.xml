The South county bike path is a 13 mile round trip adventure going from the historic Kingston railroad station all the way to the heart of downtown Wakefield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The path itself is scenic with lots of trees and nature (the picture with the goats was taken on our last ride on the path).  There's a small section (roughly a block) that is on a quiet, residential street, but other than that and a few road crossings with lights, the path is all isolated from the flow of traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also a highly rated ice cream shop at the midpoint of the path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come on and join us for a friendly ride this holiday weekend!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be right in front of the train station, on the sidewalk.
