Between now and the the meeting, take and bring 1-3 photographs which somehow speak to your interpretation of the subject - please feel free to take great liberty with your interpretation of the subject. We'll pass around the photos and see how creative, technical, fun, and skilled we can all be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be shy, we have a very encouraging group of critics and we'll all learn something from the experience. Most of all, &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;have fun shooting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brown Bag Bingo - Month 2:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Month Two for Brown Bag Bingo.
