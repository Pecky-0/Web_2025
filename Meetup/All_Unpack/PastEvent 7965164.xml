It's actually remarkable the way they fall into the pack mentality. After the initial excited 5-7 minutes of greeting each other and finding their comfortable slot in the pack, they settle in and march like soldiers. Please bring water for the walk. I will provide bowls and water for the beginning and end of the walk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancellation procedure: If it is raining, too hot, too cold, etc. a cancellation notice will be sent via email and posted on the meetup website 1.5 hours prior to the meetup time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Meetup.com charges each group a $15 a month meetup fee. This is a group fee and if not paid, our meetups would not exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is in charge of paying this fee every month. It would be appreciated, but not expected, if at the meetup, members submit a donation that goes towards the monthly $15 fee. Give $1, give $10. If at the end of the meetup, the organizer has not collected enough to meet the $15, she will pay the difference. If she receives more than $15, the extra would go towards the next meetup, treats, the fresh bottled water for the walk, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please do not feel you need to bring cash to the walk. I have setup a paypal account so those who would like to contribute can do so safely and securely whenever they can**&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the entrance directly across from Stop and Shop. I hear this is the largest parking lot. Near the blinking yellow light on the right. (Not the Turkey Hill entrance..) You will see the forrest board and park map, etc.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211810867000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>You will have had fresh air, exercise and a tired pup all before noon!</why><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211163267000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>South Shore Pack Walk - 1st Hike!</name><id>7965164</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211637600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/7965164/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/5/b/global_4112907.jpeg</photo_url></item>
