The gates open at 6:00 on October 31st at the Steel Yard, and admission is $5. Activities from 6pm - 7pm will include a ceramic bowl sale by our Ceramics Cooperative, bike art and costume building with Recycle-A-Bike, and a pumpkin flinging trebuchet. Proceeds from the bowl sale will benefit the Ceramics Department and resident artists. Hot cider and snacks will be available by donation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iron Guild's casting performance will start promptly at 7pm. The first Guild performance at the Steel Yard brought us a glowing skull with iron wings. Last year, they unveiled the giant flaming heart and poured molten iron into pumpkins. This year...zombies, brains, and candy.&lt;br /&gt;Stick around after the pour for music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For pictures and video from previous Iron Guild performances, check out their website: IronGuild.net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, please call 401-273-7101.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;specific event details : &lt;a href="http://thesteelyard.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://thesteelyard.b...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;general info: www.thesteelyard.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I will be at this event and welcome any others to join in.
