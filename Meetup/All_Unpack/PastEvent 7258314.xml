Unless you have your own bowling shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have your own bowling ball, you will have to&lt;br /&gt;Look around the Bowling Alley for one that fits your &lt;br /&gt;Hand and how you Bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Most member should know us, but I might have Meet Up sign on the Table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike B.</member_name><member_id>3713716</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205791344000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><why>You want to join a group that is trying different things.</why><group><who>Coffee Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>coffee-397</urlname><id>570343</id><group_lat>41.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9599990845</group_lon><name>Coffee Talk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202101755000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Who wants to Go Bowling on a Saturday night</name><id>7258314</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205618400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/coffee-397/events/7258314/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/c/3/global_1719779.jpeg</photo_url></item>
