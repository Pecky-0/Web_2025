&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;We did this topic last year, and everyone &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; it.  It's definitely worthy of doing on a regular basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We'll be sharing successful manifestations - big and small, intentional and unintentional; and we'll be modeling out what you did that allowed them to happen. &lt;strong&gt;When you become more aware that you DO know how to manifest what you want and how you do it, it will build your belief in positive ways and attract and allow even more success!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333399"&gt;Join us in celebrating the magnificent creators that we are!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333399"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please go to our files page (under More) to read about parking.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333399"&gt;Thank you so much to those of you who have RSVP'd "yes" and showed up! PLEASE, PLEASE, show up if you sign up. We set up our space, and prepare snacks and handouts accordingly. Also, we can only take a maximum of 20 people in our space, and do not want to exclude anyone unnecessarily because of a no-show. Help us reach our goal of 100% attendance for those who rsvp "yes"!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333399"&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun! Please join us and stay "connected" by participating in our community's message board discussions and receiving our e-mails (which will include our "Good Vibrations" tips and news). To be able to do so, go to your account, and under "Your Groups", each one has an "Edit email settings". Set your preferences there. Hope to hear from you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"MY FAVORITE! Facilitated well and includes people at all levels of experience with topic. Great for beginner to very experienced. You will meet like minded people from diverse areas."  Ingrid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It was a really helpful, practical and relaxed discussion about LOA - and also inspiring to me."  Carolyn H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eagerly looking forward to co-creating with you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;/p&gt;
