<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 2-day - WET ;-) - fall hike on the Appalachian Trail starting at the AT parking area on Rte. 55 in West Pawling, NY and heading southbound to the Long Hill Rd. parking area near East Fishkill, NY (at Shenandoah Mtn. at the eastern limit of Clarence Fehnestock Memorial State Park) for a total of about 14.7 miles. This is the next segment of the AT southbound from the Oct. '08 trip for the group. We'll spend the night at a shelter on the trail (may or may not be full so plan accordingly). This hike is for moderate hikers who have done 10 mile hikes before as well as lightly equiped backpacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Weather update 11/15/08: Sat. -rain and chance thunderstorms Noon to 9 PM, around 62 F. Sunset 4:35 PM. Overnight rain to 5 AM, low 49 F. Sun. -cloudy 20% 18 mph, 49 F for high, sunset at 4:34 PM***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at Noon at the Rte. 55 parking area near West Pawling, NY (see below). The first day we'll cover 3.3 miles. We'll hike a roughly 500 ft altitude gain to the Morgan Stewart Shelter. We should be getting to the shelter by 3 pm to scrounge wood for a great fire, eat dinner, enjoy the evening, and set up for the night. The shelter should be reserved for solo hikers if there are any so please try to plan to bring a light tent and/or share tent space. If there is space in the shelter (which is likely), we can use it after nightfall. Sunset will be at 4:35 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the second day, we'll continue starting 7:00 AM sharp as we have limited daylight and 11.2 miles to cover as well as less daylight. We'll end at the parking area for the AT on Long Hill Rd. near the intersection of I-84 and the Taconic State Parkway (see below). Altitude range for the day will be a general decent from 1,300 ft. on Mt. Egbert to about 500 ft., then up to about 1,100 ft on Hosner Mtn, back to about 400 ft. and up to about 1,000 ft. to end. We should end hiking by about 4:30 PM. Then we'll shuttle back to the cars at Rte. 55. If there is interest, we'll hit a place to eat in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that terrain, conditions, and individual party members may affect the overall timing of the hike and may necessitate backup plans if any member of the party runs into significant issues or if there are weather related issues that spring up. I have been conservitive with the estimated times and as long as all parties are reasonable fit, experienced, and equiped we should come in earlier than I estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;== ADVISED MUST-BRING GEAR/SUPPLIES ==&lt;br /&gt;* Full pack&lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots -Must be comfortable, &amp;amp; broken in &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks&lt;br /&gt;* Layers of clothing -Cold mornings/nights, avoid cotton as it stays wet.
