It's going to be held in OUR REGION this year! (Soule Homestead Education Center, Middleborough, MA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting the Convergence is a great opportunity to not only spread the word about permaculture in Eastern MA, but also, to bring the Eastern MA permaculture community together. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of us have been getting the ball rolling since November. Now, we would like to extend the invitation and ask you to join our planning efforts! There is a lot of work to be done, and I'm sure you have skills that would be very helpful for putting on a convergence. Whether you like to crunch numbers, provide fun activities for kids, or cook delicious local food, there is an opportunity for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us NEXT SUNDAY, March 4, 10 am - 1 pm, at the Community Room at Harvest Coop in Cambridge (581 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA 02139), for our next Planning Meeting. We will get to know each other, get updated on existing activities, and plan our next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you will attend or are interested in attending, but can't make this meeting, please email abbey.lamay@gmail.com. &amp;nbsp;We would love to have you join our team! Looking forward to meeting you!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elizabeth </member_name><member_id>389569</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Iris Weaver</member_name><member_id>8857212</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abbey</member_name><member_id>10196653</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330950688000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330366734000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Northeastern Permaculture Convergence Planning Meeting</name><id>54036402</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330873200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/54036402/</event_url></item>
