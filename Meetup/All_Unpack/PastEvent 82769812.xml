This is the question faced by the subjects of As We Forgive, a documentary about Rwandans coming face-to-face with those who slaughtered their families during the 1994 genocide. Without the hope of full justice, Rwanda has turned to a new solution: Reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you! These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It's also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people! These events are free, and if you would like to give a donation, we will send it to an organization that's truly helping the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The donations accepted at this screening will be given to the Prison Fellowship International Center for Justice and Reconciliation. They promote restorative justice initiatives that work to heal broken relationships, repair the damage done by crime and restore the offender to a meaningful role in society.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349054720000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347894328000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie September -  As we forgive</name><id>82769812</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348959600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/82769812/</event_url></item>
