&lt;p&gt;Best-selling books have spotlighted Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens. Of course traditional religious thinkers have criticized them. But they have also faced criticisms from many humanists. How are those controversies related to the increasing percentage of Americans who identify as “religious Nones” or as “Spiritual But Not Religious?” &lt;br /&gt;

 We are very pleased to have Robert B. Tapp, Ph.D, as our anniversary speaker. Dr. Tapp has been a tireless educator of humanists for decades. Random highlights of his lengthy career include Summer Lecturer, Starr King School for the Ministry, 1959; Dean, Humanist Institute 1993-2005; Professor of Humanities and Religious Studies, University of Minnesota, 1972-1994. He has been published regularly since 1953 in such varying publications as American Journal of Theology &amp;amp; Philosophy, Journal for Humanistics (Utrecht), and Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with a potluck dinner at 7:30 p.m. The talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365734228000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364557153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Anniversary Meeting: Robert B.
