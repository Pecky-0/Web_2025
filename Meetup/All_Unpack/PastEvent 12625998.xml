(Paul Revere took another route). If you're not running the Boston Marathon that weekend, we meet at the Government Center T station at 9:00pm and start the run at 9:30pm, just as Dawes did. If we don't drag our asses to bad, we'll arrive in Lexington just before midnight, as did Dawes. Part workout, part history lesson, the run goes through Downtown Boston, the South End, Roxbury, Brookline, Allston, Brighton, Cambridge, Arlington and Lexington. We'll try to run about 8:00 pace so you can join us for part of it if you're not up for the whole 19 miles. You can find a map and a schedule I posted last year at: &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/the-most-informal-running-club-ever/files" target="_blank"&gt;http://groups.google....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drop me a line at CSUmchugh&amp;quot;at&amp;quot;gmail&amp;quot;dot&amp;quot;com if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The guy in running shorts in Government Center at 9pm </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael McHugh</member_name><member_id>1987659</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271812303000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266385165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>William Dawes Adventure Run</name><id>12625998</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271638800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/12625998/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
