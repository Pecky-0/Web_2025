The band playing that evening is Entrain and they are fantastic! I used to follow them when I lived in Salem ages ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $28 each so I would suggest purchasing a ticket directly through the link and letting me know so I can keep a tally. I hope folks are interested! Also, there is a pre-party beginning at 6pm at the Landing which I plan on attending too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Rock and Blues Concert Cruises&lt;br /&gt;Cruises depart from the Boston Harbor Cruise gates at Long Wharf, adjacent to the Long Wharf Marriott and across from the New England Aquarium on Atlantic Avenue.
