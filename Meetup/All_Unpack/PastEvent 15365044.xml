The terrain is relatively flat so it's an easy hike.  FYI: Technically, I hear the dogs are not supposed to be off-leash, but when I was there recently, I didn't see one dog on-leash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the parking lot at 10am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;Laura &amp;amp; Molly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Please bring plenty of bags so you can pick up after your pooch!  And water is probably a good idea too.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PPS I was thinking of planning another hike at Ravenswood in Gloucester sometime over the next few weekends.  Please email me and let me know if you would be interested and which days/times would be best for you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There is a parking lot; we will meet there.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290779971000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289099184000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel November Meetup </name><id>15365044</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289487600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/15365044/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/9/1/global_7046705.jpeg</photo_url></item>
