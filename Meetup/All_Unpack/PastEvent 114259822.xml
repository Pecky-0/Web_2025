Meet in the lobby at 7:15. After 17 ministers declined the Unitarian Association's request for relief volunteers in Europe, the Sharps were the 18th call. When they committed to the dangerous undertaking, they left their young children in Wellesley to travel to Czechoslovakia at the outset of WWII. In the clandestine transportation of refugees, they combatted political and social blockades, broke laws to get exit visas and laundered money on the black market. The Sharps, and their underground confederates played a vital role in saving thousands from persecution. They are 2 of only 3 Americans to ever be honored by Israel as Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem. Co-sponsored by the Pioneer Valley Jewish Film Festival and the Massachusetts Multicultural Film Festival. Documentary. USA. 2012. 75 mins. English.
