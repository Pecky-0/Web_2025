DCR held a public meeting to introduce the RMP process in Carver on October 28, 2010, and will hold another public meeting in March 2011 when the draft RMP is ready for comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To promote greater citizen participation and help DCR create a full resource inventory, the Friends of MSSF is partnering with DCR to host a series of workshops on specific aspects of the RMP.  Everyone with an interest in the forest is invited to attend the workshops. Please comeâ€”join in the discussions, relay your knowledge of the forest, offer recommendations for better management, and help DCR create a vision for the forest's future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot attend this workshop or the public meeting, you are welcome to send your comments to Jim Baecker, Mass. Department of Conservation and Recreation Office of Regional Planning, 251 Causeway Street, Suite 700, Boston, MA  02114.  Phone: 617-626-1355. Email: jim.baecker@state.ma.us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The workshop will be held at the MSSF Conference Building, across the street from the MSSF Headquarters, 194 Cranberry Road, S. Carver.
