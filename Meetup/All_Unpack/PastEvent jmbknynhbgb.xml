Eight years later, the American people continue to live in the aftermath of 9/11 and deal with its ongoing repercussions. Is this just another machination of power on the timeline of history? If so, the real question is what happens next? Or better yet, what can we do to prevent another 9/11?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film serves as a fundamental call to action which is fueled by hope that those affected by 9/11 will soon receive the answers that they have sought after for nearly a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also at this meeting:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Report on Peterborough 9/11 Film Festival&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; a report on the Vote for Answers NH campaign to put 9/11 on the town meeting agenda in New Hampshire towns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; a report on the NYC CAN &amp;quot;Building What?&amp;quot; campaign in NYC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This'll be a great meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring your blank DVDs&lt;/b&gt; to the meeting and be sure to get a copy of each video we screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may have time for other short videos, so bring your favorites to suggest to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: &lt;b&gt;1st Tuesday-Nashua&lt;/b&gt;;; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord the 4th Tuesday is open for a more northern meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at 7:00&lt;/b&gt; if you can, in order to help set up the healthy snacks and beverages (that you bring to share with others - a gift of a box of tea for Gene's inventory would be appreciated) and enjoy the pre-meeting networking.
