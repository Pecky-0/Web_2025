After warming up we'll get a game going! Check our &lt;a href="http://flagfootball.meetup.com/49/about"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt; page for a full list of game rules, group policies and rule modifications. At 6:30 or so we'll head over to UNO's to finish up with conversation over food/drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who take public transportation, the Harvard T stop and 66 bus stop are a couple blocks away (see the map). A map of nearby metered locations can be found &lt;a href="http://img371.imageshack.us/img371/8397/parkingfd7.gif"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Send me a note if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please remember we play for FUN! Don't come expecting to play a rugged game of flag football. While we are competitive, we're not aggressive. Let's use this opportunity to befriend others interested in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191370234000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190678530000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flag Football on Cambridge Common</name><id>6420752</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191096000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/6420752/</event_url></item>
