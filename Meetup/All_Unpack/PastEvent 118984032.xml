&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its that time of the year . Our friends at the AMC are looking for a few of you to help out on Breakheart Trail. So again if you have  time the time off from work and you can help the folks who maintain the the trails we love to hike on , come on down . These are also great learning experiences.  We will be replacing a worn out log bridge over a small stream on the trail . So please expect to get get dirty and bring work gloves if you have them . &lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/e/6/event_235107622.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;If anyone has chainsaw experience  the would be helpful . &lt;strong&gt;Chris Shafer from the AMC&lt;/strong&gt; will be your host .I cannot make this one . Please bring plenty of water , food and insect repellent . Blaze Orange required. Meet up location and more details will be provided midweek .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your help ,&lt;/p&gt;
