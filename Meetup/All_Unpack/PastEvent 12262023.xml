Discover what is already in the way of you achieving your desires and release them to a Higher Power. Cleared of your own internal resistances, you will become empowered to manifest your highest vision for yourself. Having your declarations witnessed by community in sacred space adds an energetic vibration of potency to your intentions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are constantly creating our experience. It just happens that most of the time we are doing so unconsciously, through conditioned response. Come harness the natural gestation energies of winter and the fresh optimism of the New Year to consciously choose the reality you will give birth to this year.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:30-9:30pm &lt;br /&gt;$20 if prepaid by 1/28 or $25 at the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No previous experience necessary. Beginners welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last event sold out, so reserve your spot right away!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brynn</member_name><member_id>7976948</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266021710000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Passionate Souls</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tantric-Intimacy</urlname><id>1471990</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Tantric Intimacy</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262971810000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PUJA: Seeds of Creation</name><id>12262023</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264897800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tantric-Intimacy/events/12262023/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/5/global_9116789.jpeg</photo_url></item>
