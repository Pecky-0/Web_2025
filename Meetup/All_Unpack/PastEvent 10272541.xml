Fun group of people, potluck refreshments, great space for dogs to play together, floor to ceiling windows. You can talk about your dog as long as you want and no one will object!!!  Hugging other people's dogs is allowed.  I promise to remember to bring the dog toys next time.  We can also use the agility training equipment if we want (remind me to do so at the next meet if you want to use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP if you know ahead of time.  Otherwise, if you can come at the last minute, come anyway even if you haven't RSVP'd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start a Bigger Small Dog Breed Meet in May.  It turns out that the really small breeds tend to get nervous around bigger small dogs, based on our last two Meets combined with the Boston Maltese Meet.I need feedback from all members that have dogs over 15 lbs (approx.)  e.g. Terriers, Dachshunds, Bijons, Cotons, Cockers, Pugs, etc etc etc etc. about what kind of site you want to meet at and what date/time of the day.  Please email me at:  laptopmaltese@aol.com to let me know any thoughts you have on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small dog best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask someone who I am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245609928000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Small Dog Breed Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-136</urlname><id>727218</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Massachusetts Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240788733000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meet, May 17, 3-5 pm, Especially for Pets, Sudbury</name><id>10272541</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242586800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-136/events/10272541/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/global_5544145.jpeg</photo_url></item>
