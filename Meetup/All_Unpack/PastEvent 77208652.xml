&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different events and restaurant scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Gepetto's Grilled Pizza in Federal Hill in Depasquale Square!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in true, original P-Collective style, I was wandering around Depasquale Square recently and passed by this place. Big floor to ceiling doors open out onto a patio covered with flowers with tables and chairs to enjoy the summer evening and festive atmosphere of Federal Hill. Inside is a large bar serving up everything from beer and wine to cocktails with the doors offering a nice view out onto the patio and the summer air in. They are known for their grilled pizza and offer classes in a variety of Italian cuisine too. So, for those that have been mentioning Federal Hill and "the Square", we're going and here's your chance! Â  So let's check it out! And, see......you thought I forgot about Monday night!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring a friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a bright blue, gradated-dyed scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
