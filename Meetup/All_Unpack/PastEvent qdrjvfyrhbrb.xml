&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333333"&gt;Couch to 5K Training, 8th Session BEGINS April 22nd! Walkers &amp;amp; Joggers Welcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;April 23, 2012 · 6:30 PM (and Monday and Wednesday nights following)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;Braintree High School Track&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;Can you believe that this is our 8th session of the Couch to 5K training program!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;For those of you not aware, I have been going through some personal health issues since October which will continue into early 2014.&lt;/span&gt;  With some incredible support, this event will be able to continue.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; If I am not available to host, Jill or others in the group will step up for me. SO much appreciation to them for their assistance in not letting this wonderful training program fall off this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;If you don't think you can run, THINK AGAIN! If I could do this, then anyone can follow this program at their own pace to run, jog or "wog" a 5K. We have so many graduates already and I'd love to see more. Please invite your friends to join us! Having a group to train with is part of the success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;If you missed passed sessions, we will meet twice a week at the track to train for 5K events. We had walkers join us and cheer us on and more experienced runners who gave us inspiration. After months of meeting at the track, I met some great people and made some wonderful friendships. The support and encouragement of doing this with a group is so amazing! The time at the track became something I looked forward to and really miss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;If you are looking get in time to walk, want to train with us, or are runner of your own, please join us every and any Monday and Wednesday night at BHS. To get everyone ready for a 5K, event we will be posting training events using the "Couch to 5K" training schedule. When more options are available, I will find some 5K events to post on the calendar for our "final exam".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #555555"&gt;(we will be meeting twice a week for those who are training, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Friday or Saturday to keep with the schedule) &lt;br /&gt;
