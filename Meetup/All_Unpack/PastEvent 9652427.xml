<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>In a Ford Hall Forum lecture in 1984, Leonard Peikoff noted that the American School system is concerned only with &amp;quot;concretes&amp;quot;, leaving children unable to think or conceptualize. Ayn Rand, in an essay for The Return Of the Primitive, dramatically asserted that today's educators are really modern day Comprachicos: people who buy children and turn them into monsters -- in this case, monsters of the mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Objectivists and free thinkers, how do we educate our children in this environment? Do we send them to private schools? Home school them? Or, since we already pay the taxes, do we simply send them off to public schools, to encounter union driven, &amp;quot;dispassionate, mind-trainers&amp;quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come for a round table discussion on the above and other issue issues concerning education in our modern world at the next Objectivist Salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: Sunday March 1st, at 11:00am&lt;br /&gt;Where: The White Horse Tavern, 116 Brighton Ave, Allston, MA&lt;br /&gt;Why: Because you have an opinion about today's education practices and you enjoy bacon with strawberries.&lt;br /&gt;What (to do): RSVP to reserve your spot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brunch typically costs $11 per person.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>dollar sign bling!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240156127000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233578281000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand March Meetup</name><id>9652427</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1235923200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/9652427/</event_url></item>
