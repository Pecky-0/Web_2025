My apologize to those knee deep in cups of tea, but worry not, we're still reading it....we're just pushing that to August so our book requester can attend.  In the meantime, to enthusiastic book club support, we're throwing in some late night cram sessions to get in Victor Frankl's: Man's search for Meaning by the 28th (the good news is, the fact that it was published in the last century means it might actually not be checked out at your local library!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apologies for the lack of full book club vote, but as is that nature of our spontaneous crew, we're sneaking one in unpolled.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the publisher's comments: (copied from: &lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780671023379" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.powells.co...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publisher Comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;When Beacon Press first published Man's Search for Meaning in 1959, Carl Rogers called it &amp;quot;one of the outstanding contributions to psychological thought in the last fifty years.&amp;quot; In the thirty-three years since then, this book ? at once a memoir, a self-help book, and a psychology manual ? has become a classic that has sold more than three million copies in English language editions. Man's Search for Meaning tells the chilling and inspirational story of eminent psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and other concentration camps for three years during the Second World War. Immersed in great suffering and loss, Frankl began to wonder why some of his fellow prisoners were able not only to survive the horrifying conditions, but to grow in the process. Frankl's conclusion ? that the most basic human motivation is the will to meaning ? became the basis of his groundbreaking psychological theory, logotherapy. As Nietzsche put it, &amp;quot;He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.&amp;quot; In Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl outlines the principles of logotherapy, and offers ways to help each one of us focus on finding the purpose in our lives. This new edition of Man's Search for Meaning includes a new preface by the author, in which he explains his decision to remain in his native Austria during the Nazi invasion, a choice which eventually led to his imprisonment. It also includes an updated bibliography of books, articles, records, films, videotapes, and audio tapes about logotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're also throwing a new location into the mix, still sticking to Central Square, but checking out what the vast construction near main street has accomplished in providing us the Jill Brown Rhone Park.  It's directly across from the fire station on Mass Ave, in front of Luna Cafe, and a plethora of small restaurants allowing us to grab anything from indian to chinese to calzones to munch on...and there's Toscanini's for desert!  Look for us converging on the planters directly in front of Luna Cafe (403 Mass Ave) and Desi Dhaba (401 Mass Ave).  If it's raining, we'll head into Luna Cafe for cover.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will be hanging on the planters in front of Luna Cafe.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217459410000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216090431000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Readers</name><id>8342788</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217286000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/8342788/</event_url></item>
