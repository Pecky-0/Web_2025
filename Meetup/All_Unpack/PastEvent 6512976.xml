Please schedule some time this month to attend at least one canvassing event. The sooner we get done in Nashua, the sooner we can move on and spread the word to another town. If you do not know how to canvass, don't worry, we'll show you everything you need to know. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated time to 12:30 so I can meet someone there to give instructions and turn over the packet too.  I have to be in Manchester at 1pm for a mtg.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192552479000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191875184000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canvassing in Nashua</name><id>6512976</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192379400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6512976/</event_url></item>
