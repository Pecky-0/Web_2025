&lt;p&gt;Thundercats, HO!!!!! Come see the New England Philharmonic perform the world premier of "Suite from Thundercats." It is the music from the original 80's cartoon by the original composer, arranged for full orchestra. I'm playing violin with the NEP and I can personally certify that the music is freakin' awesome; I feel like I'm playing in a recording studio in the 80's. The performance takes place at the Tsai Performance Center at BU (BU West T-stop on the B-line). Tix are $25 general admission and $5 for students; they are very loose with the student ID's so as long as you look young enough, tell them you'd like a student ticket and they'll let you in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokofiev: Peter and the Wolf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haydn: Cello Concerto in D major (soloist is a 12 y/o who kicks ass)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will you indulge in auditory nostalgia of a time when cartoons used to be good, you will get to see me perform and support my orchestra! :)&lt;/p&gt;
