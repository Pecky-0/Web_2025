Let's take this opportunity to show our enthusiasm and strength in numbers to the the other GOP attendees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An hour prior to the GOP BBQ, we will meet to line Elm Street with Ron Paul supporters holding campaign signs and revolution banners. This rally will take place just a couple of blocks away from the GOP event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the banner wave, we will head over to the GOP event to cast our votes for Ron Paul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet at the Verizon Center at 11:00 AM and spread out from there.&lt;br /&gt;555 Elm Street, Manchester, NH 03101&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry if you don't have signs or banners. The Nashua Ron Paul Meetup Group will supply 35, 3 x 9 foot banners that we've made for this purpose. We have more events planned with these banners, so be sure to return them after the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190203902000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186274474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revolutionize Elm Street</name><id>6126570</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189954800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6126570/</event_url></item>
