Learn how to pick up cues from others, trust your intution, relax while speaking and practice putting words to your thoughts, feelings, and requests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is from $20-40. The traditional cost of my workshops have been $40 with a sliding scale. I have changed it from $20-40 but I don't turn anyone away. Pay the best you can, even if below $20. If you can afford more, it helps those who can't and helps me too! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb is a relationship coach of 30 years and has been teaching courses on communication skills for that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb Pearce&lt;br /&gt;781 648 3737&lt;br /&gt;www.herbpearce.com&lt;br /&gt;www.Enneagramtraining.blogspot.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240528021000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Arlington-Singles-Events</urlname><id>1416650</id><group_lat>42.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Arlington Singles Events</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237913005000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Basic Skills of Communication</name><id>10024592</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239058800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Arlington-Singles-Events/events/10024592/</event_url></item>
