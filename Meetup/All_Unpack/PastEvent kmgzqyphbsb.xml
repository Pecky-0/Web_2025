&lt;p&gt;It's been a busy off-season. New board members were voted in, the dock was refurbished and we got our new practice boat. We are recruiting for new members to join us for the upcoming race season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to welcome back our current members, without you&amp;nbsp;none of this could be made possible. We'll be practicing twice a week. Wednesdays from 6-8pm and Saturdays from 9-11am. Your welcome to come down and practice. The fees are $10/practice or $35/month. And like always, your first practice is always free.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park behind the Ocean State Job Lot and follow the gravel path to the pavilion</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carlos Costa</member_name><member_id>10120700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305510045000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>We all want to be competetive at our races.</why><group><who>Dragonboat Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ocean-State-Dragon-Boat</urlname><id>1501194</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Ocean State Dragon Boat</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304343823000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Practice for the upcoming race season</name><id>kmgzqyphbsb</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1305378000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ocean-State-Dragon-Boat/events/17571511/</event_url></item>
