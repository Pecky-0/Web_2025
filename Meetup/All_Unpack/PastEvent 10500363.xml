Here's a little history on the Franklin Café... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1995 David Dubois was approached by Maureen McLaughlin, one of Boston’s most well known bartenders, with the idea of opening a South End neighborhood restaurant/bar that would reflect Boston’s growing cosmopolitan sense of self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sixteen months of development and build-out David and Maureen opened the Franklin Café in December of 1996. The restaurants unique ability to combine some of the cities best Modern American cuisine, a great wine list, nine microbrews on tap, with a lively eclectic bar scene made it an instant favorite. This coupled with a full menu served seven days a week until 1:30 a.m. Made late night at the Franklin Café the place to unwind for the staff from many of Boston’s best restaurants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these years later the Franklin Café has become synonymous with consistent quality, value, and a great time as well as bringing these two area-natives local, national, and international accolade and attention. Most importantly to David and Maureen these two restaurants have become a healthy and productive part of the fabric of their respective communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, hope to see you all at the Franklin Café. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Mike/Meet up</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245188472000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243389114000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Return to the Franklin Cafe - One of the very best venues in the South End</name><id>10500363</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245015000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10500363/</event_url></item>
