(loud cheers from the crowd)  Running from March 15-20 and 22-27, Restaurant Week allows the perfect excuse to explore those restaurants that have caught your eye, without breaking your bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heh, and of course, Beantown is breaking it's exploration theme and going back to an old favorite (although by group demand of those both having attended and interested in trying it for the first time).  Besides, it's been remodeled!! (Yeah, I'm just looking for any excuse at this point :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out their website at: &lt;a href="http://www.elephantwalk.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.elephantwa...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that if you skip one of the four courses, the price drops from $33.09 to $29.95 (although 3 bucks for an extra course seems quite the deal).  Please note that tax and tip are not included in this price so be sure to bring enough cash to cover these additions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help make or break your decision, check out the menu at: &lt;a href="http://www.elephantwalk.com/ElephantWalk_RestaurantWeekDINNERmenu_2009Winter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.elephantwa...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, wine pairings are available and listed at the above site&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As reservations are involved, am gonna be my typical stern self about RSVPs.  Please be respectful of the restaurant, your fellow Beantown-er's and myself and keep your RSVP's accurate.  There is no penalty for changing plans prior to 24 hours in advance, we've all been there.  And we will make use of the waiting list, so others can take your place.  No shows will evoke considerable wrath :-).  Heh, don't get the vetchick angry :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, there is no maybe option, but a guest is welcome.  (I'm not a total ogre:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is available on site (the scary signs relate to business hours), and it is a fairly short walk from the Porter Square T.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be congregating in the bar at 6:45 pm.  Per the norm, will provide my cell number 24 hours prior to the event to those attending.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, contact Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Will provide cell number to RSVP's, and be waiting in the bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa/vetchick</member_name><member_id>4120480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1238309465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236613455000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Restaurant Week:  Elephant Walk, Cambridge</name><id>9914943</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238107500000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/9914943/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/f/global_4486527.jpeg</photo_url></item>
