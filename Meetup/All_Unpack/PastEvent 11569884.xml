So, please join us for a frightful night of merriment around the fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those going on the hayride will be backaround 10pm. However, you are welcome to start the fun at 9pm. Come for s'mores or the witches brew...but make sure YOU COME! We will have some fun games...I'll bet you haven't played beer pong in years...lol. Singing around the fire...scary stories...special pickies (finger foods). Alot of laughs and good folks just enjoying each others company! You can come in costume, if you like...or not. It's up to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome! Just bring a chair, maybe a snack or finger food and whatever you like to drink.Oh, yeah, bring a smile and prepare to have a SCREAMING good time....BOO!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son and some folks will be there to welcome you at 9pm.
