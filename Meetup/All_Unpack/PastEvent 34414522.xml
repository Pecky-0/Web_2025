&lt;p&gt;Remember that you don't have to be good at all at trivia to join us on Trivia nights, we're a casual group and we're there to have fun, learn some new things, and make (or meet with) new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia starts at 7:00 (well, 7:15ish), but we should meet between 6:00 and 6:30 to get good seating. Trivia runs about 2 or so hours, so you won't likely be out before 9:00-9:30, please keep that in mind when RSVPing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning teams are generally only comprised of up to 6 players, so should we exceed that, well, we won't officially win :) But if we have 11 or 12, we may make an attempt to split into 2 teams. Not likely, but possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Currently, I work until 6:15ish, and so I would not make it until just about 7:00-7:15.&amp;nbsp; It would be appreciated that whomever gets there first snags a table with sufficient seating.&amp;nbsp; Table preference for 7 or under is the round table in the corner, more than 7 would be the first set of tables to the right when you walk in.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nidal</member_name><member_id>8949503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320160936000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun Folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Games-Events</urlname><id>1435824</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Games &amp; Events Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316620230000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Stump Trivia at English Cellar Alehouse 10/30</name><id>34414522</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1320012900000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RI-Games-Events/events/34414522/</event_url></item>
