They intend on adding some sort of awning by then as well, so it should be available rain or shine.   Some changes have also been happening at Kitchen Zinc.  Not only did they add the winning pizza from their competition, they have also recently added a new segment to their menu including several smaller snack options for those that don't want a full pizza, and two additional beer taps for a total of 6.  (Several of them are alternating with the season.)    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that don't know, Kitchen Zinc is a great artisan pizza restaurant and bar on the Temple Street Courtyard &lt;i&gt;(behind regular Zinc off of Chapel Street),&lt;/i&gt; by the owners of Zinc. They combine much of what New Haven pizza is and throw in some delicious flares of it's own.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Specials:&lt;/i&gt; I've been told it will be:  &lt;br /&gt;$2 off the new &amp;quot;Cicchetti&amp;quot; (snacks) part of the menu.  &lt;br /&gt;$3 beer and $5 wine during the normal happy hour time. (till 7.)  &lt;br /&gt;And a TBD discount on one of their new Specialty Cocktails.  (Most likely the Pink Lemonade.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to the NY Times review: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.co.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nytimes.co...&lt;/a&gt;.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to give the proprietors an accurate estimate of how many people to expect (so that they can provide enough bartenders, etc.), if you think you're going to go then please RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot;.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (A.J.) will serve as the contact for this evening. You can try my Cell at 315-345-9348.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***     &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>AJ</member_name><member_id>9920708</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>19</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277189526000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275019541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Happy Hour - Kitchen Zinc  (Now with part Patio!)</name><id>13620959</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277157600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/13620959/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/d/global_13677565.jpeg</photo_url></item>
