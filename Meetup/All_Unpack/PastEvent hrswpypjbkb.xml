&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the FABULOUS Tuesday Night Study Group! All levels of English and Japanese are welcome and warmly encouraged to join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet in the beautiful Conference Room at the Borders Bookstore in Downtown Crossing. Borders allows us the use of this space for FREE. In return, they ask only the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. NO outside food or beverages**   &lt;br /&gt;2. The room must be left in a clean and neat condition, as we found it   &lt;br /&gt;3. Borders Bookstore and Cafe Staff and Employees must be treated respectfully at all times   &lt;br /&gt;4. There is a limit of approximately 25-30 people in this space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**We have had special occasions when someone has brought homemade treats to share with the group. These are allowable from time to time, as long as we leave the room clean. However, food and beverage purchases from other Cafes are NOT allowed, so please finish them before joining us ~ or, even better, purchase from the Borders Cafe to show your support and appreciation (don't forget to tip your servers)! Thank you for your generosity, and for doing your part to maintain our Group's positive image and strong relationship with Borders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are allowed indefinite use of the room until further notice from Borders, we must be flexible on nights when the Bookstore wishes to host an event of their own, or if another group requests use of the space. The issue of conflicts seems to be very rare, and we have not had any. On nights when we will be unable to meet in the Conference Room, a notice will be sent in advance and we will meet in the Cafe, on the Mezzanine level (up the stairs to the left as you enter the bookstore).&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Head past the escalators towards the back of the store. There's a small set of stairs in front of a reception desk. Go up the stairs, turn left at the reception desk and the conference room is on the left.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaylee Castroverde</member_name><member_id>8368875</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jesse Sullivan</member_name><member_id>9844902</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298051128000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290370557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuesday Night Study Group</name><id>hrswpypjbkb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1307485800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/21372231/</event_url></item>
