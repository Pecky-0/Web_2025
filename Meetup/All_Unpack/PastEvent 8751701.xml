<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our October gathering will feature actual energy healing in the group. Through the power of a single intention, healing, the group will learn energy healing modalities for relief, healing &amp;amp; improvement in various areas of their life. We will channel the power of many hearts and many minds into one laser beam of focused thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Levin will give a brief lecture and demostrate his &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Transcendental Healing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sariyd will share information on chakra-clearing &amp;amp; re-balancing through a demonstration of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Empowerment Technique&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and a Q&amp;amp;A session. There will be group participation so volunteers will be needed - don't be shy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have a moment of meditation and do some very basic work with the breath. Proper breathing is vital to one's capacity to connect with the Source of healing and consciously direct and work with energy. (Note: &lt;b&gt;No shoes in the meeting space&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimum # of participants needed: &lt;b&gt;Unlimited&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Rear entrance - up the stairs.
