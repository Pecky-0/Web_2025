The March Restaurant of the month is the Cucina Toscana Ristorante Italiano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Restaurant of the Month:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cucina Toscana is an authentic Italian restaurant located in Nashua, NH. This cozy restaurant seats 56, and every meal at Cucina Toscana is completely made to order with fresh ingredients. They  create freshly made Caesar salads that can be prepared at your table and make their own meatballs, sausages, and sauces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reviews:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this restaurant. It is definitely a hidden gem. You would not know it was so good because of the location (it is in a strip mall) - but do not be deceived - it is some of the best Italian food I have ever had. David (the owner) is always so pleasant, and in such a good mood. He is so wonderful. It is small, and the tables are a bit close together, but I do not mind that. The food is amazing. Do not pass this one up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46172-d1036695-r36048741-Cucina_Toscana_Ristorante_Italiano-Nashua_New_Hampshire.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tripadviso...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Menu:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cucinatoscananashua.com/index.php?link=2" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cucinatosc...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279455383000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278086716000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FAN Restaurant of the Month</name><id>jdcjnynkbwb</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279407600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/13983352/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/2/global_16136770.jpeg</photo_url></item>
