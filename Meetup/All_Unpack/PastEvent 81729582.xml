&lt;p&gt;THE THROWDOWN BAND:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThrowDown Band exploded onto the Boston music scene in late 2009, and in a short time they attained the reputation of a band to be reckoned with in the New Blues Era; they are widely regarded as the next big act to come out of Boston. ThrowDown’s first release, “Let Sleeping Dogs Lie”, was selected as the ‘Best Self-produced CD’ by the Boston Blues Society, and has been submitted to the IBC for inclusion in the 2012 International Blues Competition, in Memphis. An aggressive, take no prisoners, guitar-shredding, soul-screaming approach to music puts them in a hard-to-define, multi-genre rock/electric-blues/rock category. And one thing is for sure: they do not disappoint! From excruciatingly soulful slow jams to hard-hitting, genre-bending rockers, a night with ThrowDown is full of peaks and valleys building to a crescendo that will slam you into a climactic explosion; leaving you dripping with sweat and begging for more. wwww.thethrowdonwband.com&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>there will be a meetup table sign ...
