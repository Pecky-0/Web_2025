<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Glass of Chardonnay, anyone?  Or maybe, ten to twenty teeny tiny samples?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or perhaps it's more the pint of Ale that suits your fancy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, all of your beverage needs (along with some amazing food) will be met as Sun Winefest heads to Mohegan Sun this January and we head there for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the event calender and the details at: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sunwinefest.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sunwinefes...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to participate in the tastings on Saturday afternoon, and then either exploring the casino, or hittting the Celebrity Chef Dine Around that evening depending on individual interest.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets for the tasting are $65 and are available through the website (though ticketmaster)  off the events page: &lt;a href="http://www.sunwinefest.com/events.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sunwinefes...&lt;/a&gt; (totaling about $74 with service charges, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a tasting on Sunday, which is equally open for your participation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food is available for purchase both afternoons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Celebrity Chef event that evening is a bit more pricey at $175, and includes food and drink pairings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to do the tasting and the Celebrity Chef event and then stay locally that night to sleep it off.  For those not interested in the evening event, we'll try and group folks to explore the casino that evening.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Mohegan's calender of events is available at &lt;a href="http://www.mohegansun.com/entertainment/schedule_of_events.jsp?vid=all&amp;amp;catid=all&amp;amp;subid=all&amp;amp;&amp;amp;pgnum=4" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mohegansun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you can discover that this weekend correlates with the World Strongest Man series or check out Jimmy Stuff and his orchestra)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets must be purchased directly for the events through the above links.  I'll be staying at the Red Roof Inn, and will certainly help coordinate you guys getting rooms there or locally, however, it will be up to individuals or pairs to make your own reservations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hotels.com/property.do?searchID=AC102644-D774-5911-6D42-C1B955906D4F&amp;amp;searchMtmPropertySupplierId=&amp;amp;acDestinationId=AC108A63-E571-F910-37B2-650F2C908000&amp;amp;sortBy=PROXIMITY&amp;amp;CIMonth=1&amp;amp;allPropertyTypesSelected=true&amp;amp;CODay=20&amp;amp;COMonth=1&amp;amp;TSRC=1&amp;amp;CIYear=2008&amp;amp;COYear=2008&amp;amp;propertyIdsToCompareString=&amp;amp;destination=AC108A63-E571-F910-37B2-650F2C908000&amp;amp;mtnHotelID=283439&amp;amp;numrooms=1&amp;amp;roomOccupancyString=1%7C%7C2%7C0%7C0&amp;amp;PSRC=B12&amp;amp;usertypedcity=Mohegan+Sun+Casino&amp;amp;paging=1&amp;amp;acDestinationType=2&amp;amp;alternateSell=&amp;amp;searchType=&amp;amp;newLandmarkDestID=AC108A63-E571-F910-37B2-650F2C908000&amp;amp;CIDay=19" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hotels.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come share a cup with your Meetup cohorts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at my house (about an hour away from the casino) and carpooling from there.
