There are little trails along the water's edge, and then a large clear path that people run, bike, and take their dogs on. There are a few boat docking areas along the way, so you can see more water and take a break at a picnic table or grassy area. My dog and his k9 buddy really enjoyed this walk! This is a popular picnic and walking place.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309485108000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278536108000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk around Massabesic Lake, Manchester/ Auburn NH</name><id>16239192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309290300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/16239192/</event_url></item>
