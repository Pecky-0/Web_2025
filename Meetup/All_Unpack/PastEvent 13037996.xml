<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Winter is over (hopefully), so as temperatures slowly rise, let's greet Spring with our first tasting of 2010!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since April is still on the cooler side, let's start with some heavier white wines and move into the light wines as the weather warms.  I'd like to start with an exploration of the white wines produced in the different wine regions of France.  I'll post of proposed tasting list in the discussion board for future meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April Tasting Focus:  Chablis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some help from Gordon's Wine &amp;amp; Liquor and Joan, I think we've got a nice line of chablis to taste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Fevre Chablis Champs Royaux 2007  ($20)&lt;br /&gt;Christian Moreau Chablis 2007  ($25)&lt;br /&gt;Frederic Gueguen Chablis Premier Cru L'Homme Mort 2006 ($37)&lt;br /&gt;Louis Michel &amp;amp; Fils Chablis Premier Cru Vaillons 2007 ($40)&lt;br /&gt;William FÃ¨vre Chablis Chablis Grand Cru Bougros 2006 ($65)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll split the cost of the wines evenly amongst the attendees and reimburse the suppliers.  With 7-8 people attending, the cost will be $24-27 per person so please bring some small bills unless you want your change in pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also need a volunteer or two to bring appetizers to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;Greeting Wine&lt;br /&gt;Wine Education/Discussion&lt;br /&gt;Wine Tasting with appetizers&lt;br /&gt;Exchange Dollars for Wine&lt;br /&gt;Wine &amp;amp; Friendly Discussion&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noel</member_name><member_id>8463776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272150304000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>White Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1441608</id><group_lat>42.5900001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269969130000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Tasting Meeting--Chablis</name><id>13037996</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271977200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/events/13037996/</event_url></item>
