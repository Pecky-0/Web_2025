<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This park was the former site of the Diamond Match Company.  There is an old mill pond and roaring cascades of the Eight mile Brook.  We will walk to an old fire tower that was once used to look out for forest fires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a special bonus, I will give an introduction to letterboxing.  This is a popular hobby of finding boxes in the woods and stamping in to them with your rubber stamp.  Bring along a rubber stamp that you like and a journal or log book to get the stamps from the boxes.  Also make up a secret trail name for yourself.  This is very clandestine.  See these web sites for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.letterboxing.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.letterboxing.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atlasquest.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.atlasquest.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 2 miles with some steep hills.  Some places are muddy.  Social walking pace.  Bring a picnic lunch, and we will eat when we get back from our walk.  We will be out for 2 hours.  Rain cancels.  Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  175 Quaker Farms Rd, Southbury, CT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=175+Quaker+Farms+Rd,+Southbury,+CT%E2%80%8E&amp;amp;sll=41.867516,-73.163452&amp;amp;sspn=0.009747,0.01781&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.458231,-73.163452&amp;amp;spn=0.00981,0.034161&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Larry</member_name><member_id>8113327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253544133000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251143073000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Southford Falls Walk, Southbury / Oxford, CT</name><id>11188682</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253370600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/11188682/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/a/global_5696794.jpeg</photo_url></item>
