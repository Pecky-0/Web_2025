It endeavors to use the scientific method to understand the origin, evolution and ultimate fate of the entire Universe. Like any field of science, cosmology involves the formation of theories or hypotheses about the universe which make specific predictions for phenomena that can be tested with observations.&lt;br /&gt;Theology encompasses belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers, usually regarded as creator and governor of the universe; systems of such belief and worship; the study of religious beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;This class discusses the differences and congruities between the two. It provides a comprehensive foundation in personal belief systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class starts at 6PM followed by OPen Circle at 7PM&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>around back, upstairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241359230000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236108380000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - Cosmology &amp; Theology</name><id>9871351</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240178400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9871351/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
