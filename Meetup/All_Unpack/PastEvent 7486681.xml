I got several emails saying that the 23rd is Easter Sunday, so I hope that Saturday will work for more people.  Sorry if the change is an inconvenience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice ride along the both sides of the Charles River.  Approximately 15 miles, and we'll end up where we started.   We always have loads of fun on our rides... maybe its the endorphins, or maybe it is Rob's hilarious bicycle attire (right &amp;quot;officer Rob&amp;quot;?)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to meet at Park Street Station at the Boston Common (&lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/482869/ParkSt.jpg"&gt;see map&lt;/a&gt;).     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why meet here?  Because it is the most accessible spot in the city.  Red, Orange, and Blue lines are all within a few blocks (I don't think you can bring a bike on the green line), there is a pay parking lot underneath the common (entrance off of Charles St).  You can also take commuter line to north station and connect to the orange line... or commuter line to south station and connect to red line.   It couldn't be any more centralized.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll probably get there about 20 minutes early for coffee and bagel.  Ride LEAVES AT 10:05!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets hope for some good weekend weather for a change!     &lt;br /&gt;I'll cancel the night before if the weather is predicted to be foul, so be sure to check your email in the morning.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Meeting fee goes to maintaining this website.  It costs Rob something like $20/month so we should pitch in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions?  email me: jontramos@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy with a bright orange messenger bag.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jon Ramos</member_name><member_id>4466935</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206367625000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><why>It is an easy ride almost entirely on dedicated shared pedestrian path.
