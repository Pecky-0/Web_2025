The show is free and runs from 7:00 to 9:30 pm.  The sign-ups start at 6:15.  If you are taking the T, Java Jo's is directly across the street from the Forest Hills T Station.  If you are driving, the parking is in the rear... you have to drive past the place, turn left and then pull into what seems like a funeral home parking lot.  The coffee shop is very nice and has a good menu as well!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be carrying a tiny guitar case and a striped purse.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246305678000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Musicians &amp; Songwriters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild</urlname><id>1420875</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The NEW England Singer Songwriter Musician Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245733639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Java Jo Open Mic</name><id>10714152</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246053600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild/events/10714152/</event_url></item>
