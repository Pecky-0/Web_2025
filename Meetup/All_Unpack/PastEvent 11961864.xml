<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Interested in getting great produce for even greater prices?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Member Alison and I eat enough produce in a week or two that it make sense for us to go to the wholesale market in Chelsea.  That's the market where all the stores go.  There we can buy produce items in bulk and split the contents between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at Alison's house in Bedford at 8 in the morning and carpool to Chelsea.  We'll shop there for a while and then drive back.  The whole expedition will probably take 2 - 3 hours.  But that means that before noon time on Saturday, one or most of two weeks' produce shopping will be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the short notice, no maybes.   But if you can't make this time, don't worry: we'll do this more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoris&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Details to be sent to participants</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yoris</member_name><member_id>8043284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259586995000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259295128000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Expedition to the Produce Wholesale Market in Chelsea</name><id>11961864</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259413200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/11961864/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_11994442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
