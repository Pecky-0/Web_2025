Let me know if this is a problem)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to everyone intrigued by neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). Here are the details of the May meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a reminder: we start the meeting at 6:30 for those new to NLP, those who want a review, and those who want to come early to socialize/network.  At 7pm we will jump into the main event for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main event: Coaching NLP Style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life coaching (or its cousin, executive coaching) is a rapidly growing field.  It turns out that NLP has a set of very powerful tools and processes for coaching people.  We will look at what coaching is (and is not), and will learn and practice several techniques for effectively coaching individuals (including ourselves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to discuss specific issues that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there! &lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;We meet on the first floor of Sturtevant Hall, 197 Herrick Road, which is near the library on the central quad of Andover Newton. &lt;br /&gt;Andover Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
