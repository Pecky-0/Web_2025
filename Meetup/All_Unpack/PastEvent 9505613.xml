We may have a choice depending on the weather and conditions. The Audubon rents snowshoes ($8.00) if conditions are right. YakTracx on hiking boots may also be an option. If you are interested in cross country skiing let me know in your reply and I can setup a group for skiing and one for hiking. We will start out at the NH Audubon and head for Battery Point, about a 2 1/2 mile round trip. We can make it longer by taking some side trails as we did on the last hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested we will meet at the Ye Olde Post Restaurant for breakfast (great omelets) at 10:00am. If your not doing breakfast meet at the restaurant at 11:30am. The trip to Lake Massabesic from there is short - or -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to go right to the NH Audubon the directions are:&lt;br /&gt;NH RT 93 North to exit 5 State Hwy 28 (Rockingham RD)&lt;br /&gt;Take a right at the end of ramp&lt;br /&gt;go 300 feet and take a left turn onto Auburn Road (by the Poor Boy Restaurant)&lt;br /&gt;Go 2 miles then continue on Beaver Brook Rd.&lt;br /&gt;Turn left at Londonderry Turnpike (By-Pass 28)&lt;br /&gt;go 2.6 miles and right turn at Spofford Rd&lt;br /&gt;Aububon Way is on the left, we will meet at the NH Aububon Center around 11:45am (after the breakfast) and start the trip at 12:15pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Ye Old Post restaurant in Chester, NH:&lt;br /&gt;NH RT 93 to exit 4, State Hwy 102&lt;br /&gt;East on RT 102 toward Derry&lt;br /&gt;Travel three miles and at the traffic circle, take the 3rd exit onto Chester Rd/RT 102, Continue to follow RT 102&lt;br /&gt;6 miles from the traffic circle at the intersection of RT102 and RT 121 (blinking yellow light) take a left&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;quot;Ye Olde Post&amp;quot; is on the left next to the hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made it a limit of 10 for the restaurant only because it is small restaurant.
