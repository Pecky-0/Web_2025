Weeks, the Weeks Act was one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation in American history. By making it possible for the federal government to purchase private property for watershed protection, flood control, and other conservation purposes, it led to the creation of a string of eastern national forests along the Appalachian Mountain chain. Among the first of these was the White Mountain National Forest, a then burned- and cut-over landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;National conservation historian Char Miller will describe the significance of the Weeks Act and tell the story of how an active and engaged citizenry made a lasting difference on the White Mountain landscape. This celebration will take place from 5 to 8 pm at the New Hampshire Historical Society, 30 Park Street in Concord, NH. Complimentary appetizers &amp;amp; beverages will be served.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is free but preregistration is required. To register, contact Karen Rose at kmrose@forestsociety.org Space is limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP on this site after receiving confirmation from the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founded in 1901, the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests is the state’s oldest and largest non-profit land conservation organization.
