If it's nice weather, we'll bring snacks for after the game and hang out on the field.  Otherwise, we'll head over to Davis and grab pizza or ice cream or something.  Before attending our events, please review our &lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/about/"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd recommend you bring a light-colored shirt for visibility's sake and a change of clothes. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, lanyards, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Please consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/IRMLHWE8OGKZ"&gt;Amazon Wishlist &lt;/a&gt;to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your optional donations are certainly appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be on the turf field, under the stadium lights.
