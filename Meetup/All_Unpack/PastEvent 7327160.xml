You need to BE at this meeting!  Boston AREIA members gave Kevin got 10?s across the board!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who don?t know, Kevin Lacasse is currently a Board Member at Large for NHREIA.  He is the Owner of N.E. Family Housing Mgt. Org., LLC ? Management Company whom owns and manages 29 residential units.  He is NH?s very own REHAB ROCKSTAR - performing rehabs on Single Family and Multi Family/Residential focusing on 10-12 rehabs annually.  Kevin?s no-nonsense, ?the numbers have to work? approach to real estate has made him independently wealthy at the ripe old age 30.  Kevin?s philosophy is...?It?s all about systems:  We have systems for everything.   We have a specific color scheme for every thing in the house.  (Clay vinyl siding with burgundy shutters, brush nickel light package, carpet color, paint, etc.).  Contractor relationships are a must.  Build strong relationships and keep them busy!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your notebooks and prepare to take copious notes because Kevin?s concept of forced appreciation allows you to CASH IN even in a down turning market!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:  Wednesday, March 12, 2008, Networking ? 6PM, Meeting 6:30PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where: Best Western Executive Court, 13500 South Willow St., Manchester, NH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best and happy investing!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernadette Trafton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.BostonAREIA.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.freeinfo4you.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dette101@gmail.com  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home office: 603-434-0093&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cell Phone:  603-834-4587&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your FREE debt free analysis and your free credit repair packet call 1-888-334-7297&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bernadette</member_name><member_id>4477491</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205534279000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>NHREIA is the fastest growing real estate investment group in NH.</why><group><who>Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestate-756</urlname><id>633261</id><group_lat>42.9399986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>NH Entrepreneurs Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202949528000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The New Hampshire Real Estate Investors Association March Meeting</name><id>7327160</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205361000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/realestate-756/events/7327160/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/e/f/global_1934031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
