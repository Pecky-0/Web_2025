This event will showcase holistic and green businesses &amp;amp; organizations, be host to a farmers &lt;span&gt;market as a preview to the upcoming Market season, as well as a “green-driven” artisans market. These artisans, designers, and makers specialize in up-cycling, recycling, and eco-friendly materials. Bring your yoga mat and dancing shoes... there will be interactive demonstrations and activities for all ages! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This event is presented by the CT Holistic Chamber of Commerce; an organization for Holistic Health Providers, Eco friendly and Green businesses or anyone interested in Healthier people on a Healthier Planet! We promote community, teach business skills at our monthly meetings, provide community education about our members and services, and act as a “gateway” to green living and Holistic Health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Saturday :: May 4th :: 10am-4pm Elizabeth Park, West Hartford, CT FREE to attend!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Imani</member_name><member_id>7960334</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cassandra Antonietta Zito</member_name><member_id>12333168</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367687301000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1367257839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday, May 4th, 2013 :: 10am-4pm :: Elizabeth Park Free Holistic &amp; Green Livi</name><id>116789542</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367676000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/116789542/</event_url></item>
