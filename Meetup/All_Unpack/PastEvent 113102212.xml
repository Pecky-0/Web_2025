Fungi thrives on moist ground to grow, so all the snow we had this winter should set this season up for some good hunting. One of the first mushrooms to find around mid April to mid May would be the much sought after morel. Although not as common here in the northeast as it is in the midwest you may get lucky and find some of these treasures. Books will tell you that they can be found in old apple orchards and burnt out wooded areas, but don't rule out residential lawns. If you check out "Jean's Fantastic Fungi" in the albums here on this site you will see some photos of some beautiful morels found on someone's lawn. At the very least, we will have a wonderful walk in nature and get to know eachother and share fungi stories. Please wear sturdy foot wear and bring something to carry anything you find such as a paper sack or basket. In order for us to maintain our meetup site we require a nominal fee of $5.00 per year for all members payable to Rick Pierro. Feel free to contact either Jean Saunders or Rick Pierro with any questions. Hope to see you there!                                 &lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Brooksby Farms, 54 Felton St, Peabody Ma. 01960</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jean Saunders</member_name><member_id>13202391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366430765000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Fungi's &amp; gils</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mushroom-Lovers-USA</urlname><id>1497456</id><group_lat>42.4700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9100036621</group_lon><name>Mushroom Lovers USA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>52</yes_rsvp_count><created>1365332939000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring Morel Hunt at Brooksby Farms in Peabody</name><id>113102212</id><headcount>44</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365863400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mushroom-Lovers-USA/events/113102212/</event_url></item>
