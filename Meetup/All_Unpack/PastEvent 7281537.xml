Dreams, surrealism, nostalgia, reality and religion are among the themes of stories narrated by photographers, who with their vision will take you to different grounds. Each collection hums its own melody, but together they chant the Ballad of Life. Visit www.photoemerge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naveed Nour, &amp;quot;The Balad of Life&amp;quot; Curator describes the collection: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Engel is exploring the meaning of his childhood dreams and has found a way to depict some of the images which he has been treasuring in his memories all these years. Jedrusiak is combining his strong poetic side with his photographic skills to show us the darker sides of metropolitan backstreet alleys that we usually won't explore on our own. Libbares is using the life of a musician friend as a mirror to reflect on himself. Russell-Jones has gone back to document a place that she once used to call home, when still living under the protective wings of her parents, but which has now turned into nostalgia. Stern is looking at life as if there are no boundaries, and with his surrealistic sense of curiosity he is shedding new light on reality, or perhaps the lack of it. Thornton is touching on the subject of faith and with her unique and respectful approach has started to document stories that are public but yet very personal to those depicted in her narrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Armenian Library &amp;amp; Museum of America, Contemporary Art Gallery (3rd Floor) &lt;br /&gt;65 Main Street, Watertown, MA 02472 | 617-926-ALMA | www.almainc.org &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours: Thur. 6-9PM, Fri. 1-5PM, Sat. 10 AM-2PM, Sun. 1-5PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Car - From the West: Take Mass Pike (Rt. 90) east to exit 17 (Watertown).
