He is the author of scores of travel books, including 30 consecutive editions of the book initially titled Europe on $5 a Day, and now published as Europe on $50 a Day. His most recent books include Arthur Frommer's Branson (1995) and The New World of Travel: Fifth Edition (1996). The Arthur Frommer travel series is the world's largest selling series of travel books.

It sold well, and in 1957 Frommer followed up with a civilian version called Europe on 5 Dollars a Day, which covered major European urban destinations. During his vacations while a litigation associate at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp;amp; Garrison, he continued his travel writing and publishing. The first guide books included Europe, New York, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Los Angeles-San Francisco-Las Vegas, expanding through the years to more than 350 titles. In 1961, Frommer founded wholesale tour operator $5-a-Day Tours, Inc. He left law practice in 1962 to pursue his travel business Arthur Frommer International, Inc., of which he was chairman and president until 1981. In 1969 Mr. Arthur Frommer built his first hotel in Amsterdam on the premises of the Weaver's Guild (in the Noorderstreet). This hotel is now known as the Hotel Mercure Amsterdam Arthur Frommer (part of the Accor group). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;[...] Frommer was portrayed by actor Patrick Malahide (an English actor) in the film EuroTrip&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>17</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264806723000</updated><rating><average>4.38000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>36</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260308056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lowell Lecture: Arthur Frommer, travel guide author  @ BPL</name><id>12046452</id><headcount>36</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264633200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12046452/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/0/global_12157104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
