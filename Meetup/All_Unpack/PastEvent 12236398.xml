Sorry, Raffael's! Sorry, Red Parrot! Apparently our members contemplated the prospect of dining on the waterfront in January and decided it would be a cold day in Hull...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, we are pleased to announce that we'll be heading back to Rustic Kitchen on Wednesday evening, January 20th, at 7:00 p.m. This was a popular venue the last time we went, and we're expecting that the response this time will be just as strong. If you're unfamiliar with the restaurant, please have a look at the writeup of our &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/ssdomg/calendar/5748402/"&gt;earlier visit&lt;/a&gt;, or at their &lt;a href="http://www.rustickitchen.biz/locations/hingham/index.cfm"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rustic Kitchen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, January 20 @ 7:00 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;94 Derby Street (Derby Street Shoppes)&lt;br /&gt;Hingham, MA&lt;br /&gt;(781) 749-2700&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rustickitchen.biz/locations/hingham/index.cfm"&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizer:&lt;/b&gt; Mike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Yes.
