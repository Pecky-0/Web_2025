After hiking around the lake and visiting the hut, we'll head back down to the trailhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An moderately-easy level hike to help us ease into winter hiking. Please bring stabilizers or micro-spikes and hiking poles. If there is enough snow on the ground and you want to bring snowshoes, that is also an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to dress in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs should be on a leash if they are not under voice/whistle command.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/3/3/highres_11272275.jpeg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the totals for this hike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Round trip Distance 3.34 mi &lt;br /&gt;Hike Time (not including breaks) 2 hr 46 min &lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +1134 ft &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exit 2 off 93N (Salem): 8:30 am &lt;br /&gt;Exit 14 off 93 N (LL Beans/Hannafords): 9:00 am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to bring doggie treats, water for yourself and your dog and pooper bags &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/tongue.gif' border='0' alt='tongue' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of attending this meetup you agree to release, hold harmless, and indemnify the organizer(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, and/or death, including those caused by negligence and or other reasons.
