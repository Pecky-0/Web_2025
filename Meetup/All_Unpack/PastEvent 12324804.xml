If you are installing on a remote server please create a database ahead of time with your database name, and password recorded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6:30- 7:00 snacking and mingling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refreshments&lt;/b&gt;: Snack provided, drinks and sandwiches can be purchased from Woodstar Caf√© next door&lt;br /&gt;Suggested donation at the door: $5-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt; please RSVP to help us plan accordingly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parking: on street after 6pm or paid lot across street&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7:00-8:30 Presentation will include&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;brief discussion of: I will explain why I think Drupal and Joomla are more useful for a specific type of site, and why CMSMS handles smaller sites better in some ways than some of the other CMS. Problems that may come up with some of the other small open source content management systems.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Five aspects of converting a static website to the CMSMS that will be covered are: installation, conversion of website, editing of content, defining and using modules and templates. will also cover support for CMSMS (&lt;i&gt;CMS Made Simple&lt;/i&gt;) and how to choose hosting.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leah</member_name><member_id>2960740</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326922538000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nohowebdev</urlname><id>540457</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>Northampton Web Developers/ Web Designers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263524315000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tools to simplify the Creation and Managment of Small Websites</name><id>12324804</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267745400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nohowebdev/events/12324804/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/a/b/global_11475755.jpeg</photo_url></item>
