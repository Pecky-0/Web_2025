It falls open to a few much used recipes and you've owned since you were in short pants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May is recipes from your oldest cookbook! Plan to cook onsite and please bring your old book to share with everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is about your creativity and personal interpretation.   &lt;br /&gt;Plan to cook onsite unless your recipe takes more than an hour to prepare. The fun is in the cooking here all together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you have brought your recipes fully prepared the last few months, make an extra effort to cook onsite this May!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting we may be out side in May!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>my home so you will notice me and the dogs will send address a few days before</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260733641000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239408438000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes May Meetup</name><id>10161538</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241823600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/10161538/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/global_4074206.jpeg</photo_url></item>
