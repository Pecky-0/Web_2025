This last money bomb is to propel Ron Paul to the number one spot in fundraising for the quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guiliani led with only $10.2 million in the third quarter. Mitt Romney has recently loaned his campaign another $13 million. It is conceivable that if Ron Paul has $25 million at the end of the quarter he can hold the number one position, whether or not a candidate has taken loans. Even Hillary Clinton raised only $21 million last quarter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal again, like before, is to get as many persons donating $100 on this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot donate this amount, please give what you can in this last and final event of the quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donate2008.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.donate2008...&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199333304000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198166687000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Q4 Money bomb</name><id>6944650</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199160000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6944650/</event_url></item>
