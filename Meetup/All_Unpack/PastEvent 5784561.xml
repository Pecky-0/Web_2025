The West Hartford MDC is having a recreation day from 9:00-1:00.  To read more event info the site is www.themdc.com/talcottmountain.htm.  There is a bird walk, yoga, biking information, and horse demonstrations.  I am going for the Orienteering event.  Apparently, it is a sport where you hike with a pupose using a map to find your way.  Pass this info on to those you know.  If you know anyone who is turned on by maps, I would enjoy doing the couse with other folks.  I have no interest in the Charlie hike so I am trying this.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope everyone is great!&lt;br /&gt;Janice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179839292000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Connecticut Arts - Theatre Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Theatre-Group</urlname><id>326612</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>Connecticut Theatre Group Arts-Theater Events Group Discount</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179333831000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MDC West Hartford Event suggested by Janice</name><id>5784561</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179666000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CT-Theatre-Group/events/5784561/</event_url></item>
