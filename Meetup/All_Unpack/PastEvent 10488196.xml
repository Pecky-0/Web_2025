[b]Update[/b]

8:15 is the time of the movie - sorry for the late start, the earlier time was too early. I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com.

I will be wearing my red meetup hat, and I will be in the theater lobby at 7:30. We should walk in to get seats 15 minutes before showtime at 8. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables at the front of the lobby in front of the giant window. If the movie is downstairs, I will be just behind the ropes across from the concession stand. If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

The highly anticipated new installment of "The Terminator" film franchise is set in post-apocalyptic 2018. John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future that Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.
