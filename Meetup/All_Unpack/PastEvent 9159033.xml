<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I am posting this meet up for any SEALs who want to make a pilgrimage out to Deerfield to Ron Helwig's &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;First Church of the Gun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A description from one member is:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ron Helwig and the other folks at the house have set up a range in the backyard, and invited everyone in the pro-liberty community to come over on Sunday afternoons (usually 1-3:30pm) to practice. It's especially great for beginners like me to have experienced people show me the ropes&lt;br /&gt;and supervise my learning process, and it's also a great deal of fun - and an absolutely beautiful setting, in the trees facing a lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your kids are well behaved, and you feel comfortable with teaching them gun safety, feel free to bring them as well. It's a family-friendly environment.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details and directions are at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronhelwig.com/directions" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronhelwig.com/directions" target="_blank"&gt;http://ronhelwig.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronhelwig.com/range" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ronhelwig.com/range" target="_blank"&gt;http://ronhelwig.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have set the meetup location to be the Puterbaugh home, in case any Seacoast-area folks want to car pool and/or caravan. Otherwise, please meet at the range. We will be leaving our house at 12:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early comers to the range are welcomed (for help setting up - roughly anywhere after 12 noon/12:30&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the range this Sunday, a gathering at the Camille residence - roughly 7 miles away in Northwood.  Kenny will be making his sweet and sour meatballs with rice.  If you aren't into meatballs/rice, you can rummage through the Camille fridge to find something you like to eat, or bring something you do like.  Desserts, refreshments/drinks will be served as well (byob) - board games, darts, Guitar Hero or Rock Band, for those interested.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Camille Home: &lt;br /&gt;Kenny and Renee&lt;br /&gt;35 Bow St.&lt;br /&gt;Northwood, NH 03261&lt;br /&gt;phone: 942.8229&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227142060000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226626265000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First "Church" of the Gun</name><id>9159033</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226856600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9159033/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/5/global_4214517.jpeg</photo_url></item>
