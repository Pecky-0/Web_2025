(And full disclosure.... Oct 1 is my birthday, so I wanted to go out!) I had a great time &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/14860354/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; when we did one (actually I think this is the third annual NHC fall bar crawl), so I hope this will be just as successful. Since it's me, I'm starting this at Box 63 and will end up at the end of the night at jazz at Olde School. Both are awesome.&amp;nbsp; You should go there.&amp;nbsp; All the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I'm thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8pm - &lt;a href="http://www.box63.com/"&gt;Box 63&lt;/a&gt; (upstairs bar)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Special just for us* - $5 Sangria and $5 Frozen Drinks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9:30pmish - Lazy Lizard Cafe - 201 Crown St. - this place is so new they don't have a website yet (so, um, don't bother looking - though you can see the reviews of the happy hour we just did there - &lt;a target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.meetup.com/New-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Haven-Collective/events/31&lt;/span&gt;805812/&lt;/a&gt;) It has eclectic decor (everything from armor to sportsbar style screens to pineapples and beach themed things - in other words, it has something for everyone! And a game room. Come on - Darts+Us+alcohol must = awesome), a relaxed vibe, and is perfectly halfway between the two other stops.... &lt;br /&gt;

 *Special - Maria the owner promises there will be...something. So SURPRISE SPECIAL!*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;11pmish - Olde School - Jazz and $7 Milagro Tequila Specials &lt;br /&gt;

 *Special just for us* - $5 Bacardi and Cokes &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;a href="http://www.oldeschoolsaloonandbistro.com/Olde_School/Home.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.oldeschoolsaloo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nandbistro.com/Olde_School&lt;/span&gt;/Home.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 There's nothing like chilling out with good peeps, drinks and jazz after an exciting evening... As you are all well aware, Olde School is one of my favorite start, middle and finishing places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My number will be in my RSVP - Give me a ring if you want to know where we are along the crawl : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!! If anyone else has something they want to go out and celebrate, let me know and I'll post it : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note in your RSVP if you are a "maybe".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommended parking centrally, or near where ever you think you'll end up. I do not recommend parking west of Park St.&amp;nbsp; My fave place to park is the yale free lot (nights and weekends) near the library, in yellow on this map: &lt;a href="http://www.yale.edu/transportationoptions/parking/Detail-MapB.html"&gt;http://www.yale.edu/transportationoptions/p...&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah</member_name><member_id>3741637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317604881000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>53</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315851676000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>**NHC does (Weekend!)
