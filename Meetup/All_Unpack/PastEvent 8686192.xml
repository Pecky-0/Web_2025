<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This flight was so awesome a few weeks ago, members brought it up again. So let's go! It's a short flight but a really missed gem of a place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marshfield, MA (KGHG).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can fly into Marshfield and have dinner at &lt;br /&gt;Fieldston Restaurant (www.thefieldston.com) located right on the ocean. We could take their courtesy van again....I'm sure everyone is up for a nice beautiful scenic flight. We meet at Charley's hangar. Wheels up 5:30, eat and enjoy a sunset flight back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KGHG" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;55.4 nautical miles &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Gary Archer's great idea. Good going Gary! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The restaurant is basically on the approach end of the runway we can take a shuttle or we could walk. (half the distance that BID and town walk is; one mile??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one should be left behind on these trips. We usually have more planes/pilots than passengers. But, please RSVP for planning.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221603708000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220528903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Marshfield, MA (KGHG).
