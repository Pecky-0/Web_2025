We will follow the trails north from rte 117 to Walden Pond, loop around the pond and back on a slightly different route. This is about 5 miles on level terrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 10:15 in the parking lot on rte 117 (S. Great Rd) a half mile west of the intersection with rte 126 (Concord Rd).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Take 2 west to 126 south to 117 west&lt;br /&gt;-OR-&lt;br /&gt;Take 128 to exit 20 (Waltham).  Take the off ramp to head towards Waltham on 20 East and a few blocks later there will be a sign for the 117 West, taking you back over the 128. From there its about 6 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a ride?  Ask for a ride from another member in your rsvp, saying where you are.  Otherwise I can pick you up at Riverside T at 9:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we will go to Margarita?s for Mexican food. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margarita's Mexican Restaurant &lt;br /&gt;227 Moody St, Waltham, MA &lt;br /&gt;781-893-9990&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry David Thoreau lived at Walden Pond from July 1845 to September 1847. His experience at Walden provided the material for the book Walden, which is credited with helping to inspire awareness and respect for the natural environment. Because of Thoreau's legacy, Walden Pond has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is considered the birthplace of the conservation movement. Park Interpreters provide tours and ongoing educational programs. The Reservation encompasses 400 acres which includes the 102-foot deep glacial kettle-hole pond. Mostly undeveloped woods totaling 2680 acres, called &amp;quot;Walden Woods&amp;quot; surround the reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;?A town is saved, not more by the righteous men in it, than by the woods and swamps that surround it.?&lt;br /&gt;- Henry D.
