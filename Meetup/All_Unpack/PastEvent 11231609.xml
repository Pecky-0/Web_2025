To accommodate all we will meet before AND after the show at the Orleans.  People can order apps or entrees but we will not have a big group meal.   Instead just come by when you can and introduce yourself.  I will have a blue and yellow jacket with a large &amp;quot;Wedeln ski &amp;amp; Outdoors Club&amp;quot; logo on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New schedule looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:30pm  Early arrivals at Orleans&lt;br /&gt;6:30pm  Somerville Theatre  - We will sit in the center of balcony&lt;br /&gt;9:30pm  When movie lets out we will be back at Orleans for a larger celebration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.orleansrestaurant.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.orleansres...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have some area reserved at Orleans starting at 9:30pm, I assume the bar will be crowded but probably at least half will be part of our group.  For the pre-movie arrivals we will look for a spot at the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today (11/3) there are still tickets available but you must purchase soon.  this will sell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warren Miller movies are the gold standard for all ski/snowboard movies. Every Fall for 50 years the Warren Miller team has toured the country to show off its latest creation.  It is not just a movie, its an event.  This year the movie is titled &amp;quot;Dynasty&amp;quot; and the preview looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$19 may seem like a lot for a movie BUT you get several 2 for 1 lift tickets and other give-aways. You will make back  your admission price - most years i go twice just to get the deals :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7pm but we will meet at a bar for drinks and snacks before the show and go over as a group. If people want to meet early we can get dinner.   We can also have a few post-movie beers as well.  This will be a great way to meet members of this meet up and make some connections before the snow starts falling.  The Somerville Theatre is in the middle of Davis Sq, about a 50 ft walk from the RedLine station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy your tickets on your own as soon as possible, it will sell out   - &lt;a href="http://www.somervilletheatreonline.com/somerville/schedule/events.php" target="_blank"&gt;Somerville Theatre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info on the movie and giveaways check out  - &lt;a href="http://Warren Miller" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skinet.com/warrenmiller/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skinet.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Wedeln Ski Club jacket with bright yellow leather sleeves.
