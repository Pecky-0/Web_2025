(Although, it would have been cool if it was!!)  All kidding aside, I really enjoyed this film and I can not wait to see again. It works on so many levels. On the surface, it's a great kid's animated movie. But, just below the surface, it's a biting satire of the world of consumerism and where we are heading if we do not care of our planet.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a review from the All Movie Guide, click here: &lt;a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;amp;sql=1:379342~T1" target="_blank"&gt;All Movie Guide Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual time of the  Meetup is at 4:25.
