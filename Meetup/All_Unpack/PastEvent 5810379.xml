The end of July marks a year that the Boston/Cambridge Meetup Group has been around.  I thought I would try to do something that comes full circle.  I wanted to have the July meetup at the first meetup event we had....The SalsaBoston Salsa Cruise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this year, I'd like to do lunch together before the cruise.  I figure we can meet up a couple hours early, do lunch near the ship, and head over to the cruise for the preparty and class.  The dinner will be held at the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Legal Sea Foods, Long Wharf&lt;br /&gt;255 State Street &lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02109&lt;br /&gt;Phone: 617.742.5300&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information about the restaurant can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.legalseafoods.com/index.cfm/page/Long-Wharf-Boston/pk/content/cd/location/pid/0/cdid/11833" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.legalseafo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner time: 5pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made a reservation for 10 people!
