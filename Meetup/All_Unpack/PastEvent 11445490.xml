Which room we will be in and on what floor will be announced in a subsequent email. There is also parking available at a cheap evening rate in the building. Parking is also free on the street in front of the building at 6 PM.

At 6:30 PM one of our original members Jacob Rus will  talk about the Node project, and the js.io project. Websites: , .

Node is a server-side javascript framework, designed completely around doing everything asynchronously, and js.io is turning into a project which tries to be sort of "Twisted for JavaScript", with many client/server protocol implementations, any of which will happily work either on the server or in a browser.

After the presentation | demonstration, we will go around the room introducing ourselves and asking the group for advice | opinions on any JavaScript-related issues members are facing.

Microsoft will provide pizza again. What a generous organization!
