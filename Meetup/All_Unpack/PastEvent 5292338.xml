Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns over the ice? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions while you take a break from holiday preparations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Socializing for Justice at the Frog Pond* on the Common for Ice Skating for Justice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Even if you can't skate, come on out!  There will surely be others with wobbly ankles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No program. No speaker.&lt;br /&gt;Just lace up and enjoy yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social. And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/127/322202329_db3287f34e_m.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Found in the center of the park, the Frog Pond is easily accessible from the Downtown Crossing area, State House and Charles Street. The best T stop to take is Park Street on the Green and Red lines. &lt;a href="http://www.bostoncommonfrogpond.org/pdf/directions.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;DOWNLOAD DIRECTIONS &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP yes, maybe or no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Socializing for Justice (SoJust) is for feminists, people working against racism, queer pioneers, genderbenders, environmental agitators, class activists, lefty artists and all people across Greater Boston working for justice in our neighborhoods, in our nation and beyond. But it's not work! Instead, we're building a strong cross-issue network through fun social events. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join the Socializing for Justice Meetup Board and you'll be able to view and post events, job &amp;amp; volunteer announcements, roommate searches, print &amp;amp; on-line resources - and you'll be able to suggest or co-host future SoJust events like this one!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1166565803000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1164639355000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ice Skating for Justice</name><id>5292338</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1166392800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/5292338/</event_url></item>
