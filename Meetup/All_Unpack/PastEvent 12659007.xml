If you said Yes but find you cannot make it after all, please update your RSVP so someone else can join.  Given that this is a popular film it may be repeated some time.  As usual we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion after the film.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your cooperation, and I'll see you Sunday or at a future Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the film:&lt;br /&gt;Condemned to six years in prison, 19-year-old Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim), part Arab, part Corsican, cannot read or write. Arriving at the jail entirely alone, he appears younger and more fragile than the other convicts. Cornered by the leader of the Corsican gang who rules the prison, he is given a number of &amp;quot;missions&amp;quot; to carry out, toughening him up and gaining the gang leader's confidence in the process. But Malik is brave and a fast learner, daring to secretly develop his own plans. Directed and co-written by Jacques Audiard (The Beat That My Heart Skipped, Read My Lips). &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just over two weeks, the annual glitz- and self-congratulation–fest that is the Oscars will take place, and &lt;u&gt;A Prophet&lt;/u&gt; will be one of the five contenders for best foreign-language film. And trust us, &lt;b&gt;this compelling and sharply observed film  —in select theaters 2/26—deserves to be there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/aprophet/" target="_blank"&gt;A Prophet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/letters/aprophet.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Director/Co-writer Jacques Audiard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will make you an offer you cannot refuse.  He'll be holding a Meetup Sign after the final credits and give you the mission to join us at a nearby place for sup and discussion.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>3369401</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>4007722</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsey Glaser</member_name><member_id>9513701</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266710788000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Prophet</name><id>12659007</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267986600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12659007/</event_url></item>
