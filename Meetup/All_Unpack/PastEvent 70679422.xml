&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping that nothing quite that exciting happens on Saturday.  Assonet ledge is a little known south shore climbing destination (and apparently suicide hotspot, but again, nothing that exciting please!)  It sits over an abandoned quarry filled with 80' deep water, and the area resembles what Quincy Quarries used to be like before it was filled a decade ago.  Teenagers commonly come here to jump off of the cliffs into the deep water, but if anyone on this trip plans on doing so, please know that I do not intend to swim down to remove your impaled corpse off of the submerged tree limb waiting for you five feet under the surface.  Some of the climbs on the sides can be reached from the ground, and others require being lowered from the top.  I'm going to bring my little rowboat so that it will be easy for us to bail off of climbs that are too hard (we can also do sling-shot belays from it, if people are more comfortable with that).  There's a beach on the far side that's a popular place to swim, and the top of the ledge is the only vista uninterrupted by buildings or power lines that I know of in southeastern MA.  There are climbs for all skill levels, but this is obviously a destination for those looking for a little bit of adventure!  The trees are pretty far back, so it will definitely help to bring some static rope or long pieces of webbing for setting up the top rope anchors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm planning on showing up here at around 10:00.  If people want to climb then that will be great, and if not, I'll hop on my mountain bike and get lost in the woods... and probably end up captured by some cult and sacrificed to the devil... but such is the price of adventure.  Anybody who would like to join me for mountain biking and ritual sacrifice victim-ing can also contact me!  Seriously, though, let's practice good LNT principles by not dying and contributing to this place's severe ghost problem...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just so everyone is prepared, I'm totally predicting a repeat of this climb on Halloween, when it will be more spooky, and hopefully also look like this  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41658249@N02/5916831577/lightbox/"&gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/41658249@N02/5916831577/lightbox/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rudy Breteler</member_name><member_id>46824442</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341785302000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Rock-Climbers</urlname><id>1496386</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>South Shore Rock Climbers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340651502000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climb the Haunted Quarry!</name><id>70679422</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341064800000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Rock-Climbers/events/70679422/</event_url></item>
