This beautiful 125' schooner is a replica of a 19th century clipper ship. We'll go for an evening sail on this magestic beauty, enjoy views of Boston and the harbor, and maybe even get to take a turn at the helm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We set sail at 6pm and return at 8pm; I suggest you arrive at 5:30pm to get tickets and meet. The cost of the trip is $30 and their is a cash bar aboard. Liberty Clipper leaves from Long Wharf. Directions are available here: &lt;a href="http://www.libertyfleet.com/directions/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.libertyfle...&lt;/a&gt;. Please purchase your tickets at the ticket booth and we will meet next to the booth until they let us walk over to the ship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 16327</member_name><member_id>16327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541759000</updated><rating><average>2.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184281645000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Sailing August Meetup</name><id>6015456</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186522200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/6015456/</event_url></item>
