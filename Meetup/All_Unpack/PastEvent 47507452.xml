Yet, it's easy to stay stuck in rant mode and to limit ourselves to just eliminating negative charges. There's much more than tapping can do! Join me for this workshop on positive EFT and learn powerful techniques to turn the tables to a more joyful you: - Reframes - Choices Method - Forking - Provocative Energy Techniques - Ultimate Truth Statement And leave this workshop fully energized and empowered with tools to bring your self-practice to a happier place. Please, respond with your input on where and when we should schedule. I can host if we have a small group, otherwise, it's probably going to be at Third Life Studio in Union Square Somerville. Tell me if a night during the week or a day time over the week-end works better for you. The first week of February sound like a likely candidate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342275106000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Healing Practitioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-healers-network</urlname><id>511093</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Healers Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326215548000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Positive EFT</name><id>47507452</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342220400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-healers-network/events/47507452/</event_url></item>
