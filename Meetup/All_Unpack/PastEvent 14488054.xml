Here's yet another chance for you to experience the baddest, loudest, funnest indoor carnival sound around. Yes, I am a GIGANTIC fan which is apparent because each time this group parties, I add them to the calendar because they exceed expectation.

Let's pack the place again, because the more the merrier and also your presence will convince Johnny D's to keep the Bloco AfroBrazil party on their schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local band &lt;a href="http://rayhendricksrevival.com/fr_home.cfm"&gt;Ray Hendricks Revival&lt;/a&gt; is also performing original music, which sounds real cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your friends....I guarantee a funtastic time, that is if you like your music strong and your party loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must be at least 21&lt;/b&gt; but you don't have to drink, just enjoy each others company and an AMAZING! show.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the drumming, singing and dancing start, group conversation is difficult.
