It's on Jefferson Street, not the one on Broadway.  Please read all the details of this event below and be sure you understand them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have to pay $10 per family (regardless of number of people or dogs) in ADVANCE. We have to make sure we'll have enough people to make it worth the owner's while to open for us. If by Thursday evening, I do not have 5 people signed up and paid, the event will be cancelled. (And in which case, your money will be refunded.) You can pay me with PayPal (if you pay with PayPal, the cost is $10.61 because of their fee, and if we cancel, you will receive $10.00 back) or mail me a check, but payment must be received NLT Thursday, 2/5. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, if you need to cancel after paying, the fee will be refundable only if you cancel by Thursday. In other words, you MUST notify me by Thursday, 2/5, if you cannot make it or I will not be able to refund your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact if you have any questions at all about the details of this Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;-laura&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be inside.  :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236444989000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231002964000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel February Meetup</name><id>9433837</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234018800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/9433837/</event_url></item>
