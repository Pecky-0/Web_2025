Come to a local Wine Meetup to taste new wines; learn about noses and legs; and discuss great vintages and estates. Everyone's welcome, from new bouquet-sniffers to educated connoisseurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also Organized &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Wine-HudsonMA" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Wine-HudsonMA" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/Wine-HudsonMA&lt;/a&gt;. This group is mostly a red-wine group but a few people expressed interest in white wine tasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the meetup.com polling mechanism, members select wines via region or grape or any criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically a group of 10-20 people meeting at a members house, once per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a successful agenda example which can also be modified:&lt;br&gt;

 o Greeting wine&lt;br&gt;

 o Educational topic&lt;br&gt;

 o Taste about 5-7 wines with Appetizers supplied by guests or host&lt;br&gt;

 o Calculate the wine cost among those attending.&lt;br&gt;

 o Guess the Mystery wine&lt;br&gt;

 o Socialize and discuss wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question to be answered is ... Are enough people interested in starting a White Wine Tasting group in the MetroWest Boston area? Join the group, send me email and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.76</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1240497951000</created><lat>42.5900001526</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>611</id><urlkey>wine</urlkey><name>Wine</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15139</id><urlkey>wine-tasting</urlkey><name>Wine Tasting</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15635</id><urlkey>wine-and-food-pairing</urlkey><name>Wine and Food Pairing</name></topics_item></topics><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name><id>1441608</id><members>91</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>748860</member_id><name>Mike Blake</name></organizer><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><city>Westford</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/</link><lon>-71.4400024414</lon></item>
