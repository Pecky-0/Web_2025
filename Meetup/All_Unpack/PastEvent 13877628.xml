In summer the Reservation is a popular swimming destination. In the spring and fall, many people hike the trails that ring the pond and visit the replica of Thoreau's one-room cabin. Year round interpretive programs and guided walks are offered as well as a gift shop, bookstore and the Tsongas gallery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's park our cars at the Lincoln train station near the supermarket and walk to the pond.&lt;br /&gt;Bring your swim suit, wear your sneakers and if you want then bring a picnic and don't forget some water to drink. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I have to work in the afternoon so anyone who wants to stay at the pond longer may just take notes or leave breadcrumbs along the way to the pond.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aimee</member_name><member_id>5071381</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277562491000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277233884000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk to and around Walden pond including a short swim </name><id>13877628</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277557200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/13877628/</event_url></item>
