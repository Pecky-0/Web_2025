&lt;p&gt;A simple plan ... we'll meet up at the restaurant and order up.&amp;nbsp; Dining time will average around 2 hours, but anyone is welcomed to stay longer.&amp;nbsp; Seating and other amenities are determined on an individual basis, but don't be shy to warm up to any open seat with other Meetup members.&amp;nbsp; Always good to bring cash just in case, for some places don't take credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month:&amp;nbsp; United BBQ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raved for it's pulled-pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and even vegan options with Seitan, the place has good reviews at prices below $10.&amp;nbsp; BBQ is not native to New England, but this place is as close as it can get and within local distance!&amp;nbsp; Seating will be limited at this venue, it's a small shack, but there is Captain Seaweeds right up the road where you can take your dinner to dine and get a drink at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
