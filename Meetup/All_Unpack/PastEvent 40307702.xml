Here's our last chance to attract support from nearly 40,000 UCONN fans. Meet up at Wendy's Parking Lot...303 Main St. East Hartford, CT at 8:30 SHARP !!! Those who wish to attend a little later can always park @ Cabellas Parking Lot, and walk over to our "Tailgating HQ" !! We need to recruit more supporters and sign wavers.....If you see a nearby resident with a Ron Paul sign in their yard, don't be shy, stop by, and engage, and promote our Meet Up; group. WE ARE GOING TO TRY A DIFFERENT PARKING LOT THIS WEEK.....MUCH BIGGER LOT, WITH MORE EXPOSURE...I GOT PLENTY OF HOT DOGS, SO BRING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF YOU WISH TO GRILL....&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1322400344000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320696803000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>UCONN FOOTBALL - SIGN BOMB - SIGN WAVE - Material Hand Outs (3rd edition)</name><id>40307702</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1322314200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/40307702/</event_url></item>
