&lt;p&gt;I am going to plan to be at the &lt;a style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; at 5:00 p.m. at Genos Fast Break Pub. There are 2 Genos Fast Breaks at the casino, with one being in the food court, but I will be at the one that has a pub. I am not sure if we can get seating here or not, but I guess we can kind of wing it for food, and go somewhere else if we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not planning on going to the restaurant, it will be important to be at the Wolf Den at 6:00 p.m. if we want to get a seat for the show. If we are late there is a chance we might not get a seat. There are also some people that are working on some car pooling plans on the active &lt;a style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;singles website&lt;/a&gt; if there is an interest for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wolf Den and JB`s are both free so that cannot be beat!If you are going to go to the restaurant please let me know so I will know who to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
