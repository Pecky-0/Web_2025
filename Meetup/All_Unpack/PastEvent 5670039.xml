Now's your chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World's End &lt;br /&gt;250 Martin's Lane, Hingham, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Trustees property, $5 non-member admission, free for members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 10:30 in the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World's End 251 acres are comprised of four coastal drumlins -- Pine Hill, Planter's Hill, and the double drumlins of World's End proper -- all connected by over four miles of walking paths that offer dramatic views of the Weir River, Hingham Harbor, and the Boston skyline. The Reservation's hills are traversed by tree-lined roads and dotted with tree groves. In between are broad grassy fields that attract butterflies and are managed to provide habitat for grassland-nesting birds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Get There:&lt;br /&gt;From Route 3, take exit 14 and follow Route 228 north towards Hingham for 6.5 miles. Turn left onto Route 3A and follow for 0.4 mi. Turn right onto Summer Street and, at major intersection with Rockland Street, continue straight across. Road becomes Martin's Lane. Follow for 0.7 mile until it dead ends at entrance and parking area (70 cars). Parking in residential areas is not permitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;ll=42.247708,-70.872889&amp;amp;spn=0.028718,0.05785&amp;amp;om=1&amp;amp;msid=106907836438136583019.00000111f1866a38b0d31" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/393_world_s_end.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetrustee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we will go for lunch at:&lt;br /&gt;Liberty Grille &lt;br /&gt;8 North St, Hingham, MA (1.08 miles away) &lt;br /&gt;781-749-2444&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177338873000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176580233000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>World's End</name><id>5670039</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177165800000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5670039/</event_url></item>
