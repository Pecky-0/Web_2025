Take a right at the light (you can't go anywhere else) where 12 joins with 20. Follow this for under a mile and you'll come to a split where 12 goes one way and 20 goes the other. Take a left onto 12 (you will see a Walmart up ahead and to the left) and follow 12 about 300 yards to the entrance to the building on your right. There are signs for the Authentic Skate Shopand North End Muscle and Fitness out on the road, and a sign over the studio door for Photography by Teya.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183246734000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1180053070000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography June Meetup</name><id>5815815</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183073400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/5815815/</event_url></item>
