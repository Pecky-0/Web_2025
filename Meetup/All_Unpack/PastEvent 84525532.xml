If you knew it meant "the end of darkness and the birth of light," you might welcome it in… This is a sacred time to be alive! The New Age is upon us and it is one of vision &amp;amp; enlightenment. What will be your contribution? Join Mother Clare Watts, Christian Master Teacher &amp;amp; Visionary, for an event that will inspire and teach us how to prepare, what to expect, and how to be a dynamic contributor to this amazing time on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother Clare has quite an interesting history. Raised in Switzerland by Baptist missionaries, she initially rebelled against Christianity and tried her hand at many different spiritual paths. She lived in a yoga ashram and trained with the Sufis for a number of years before finding the Christian mystical path. In addition, she was a professional certified midwife for 18 years, and practiced psychotherapy in Boston, Massachusetts after obtaining a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology and post-graduate training in Jungian Analysis. Mother Clare is known for her clarity and deep compassion. She is the author of &lt;em&gt;Giving Birth to God: A Woman’s Path to Enlightenment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mystical Roses of Peace&lt;/em&gt;. She lives at the Center of Light in Dolores, Colorado and oversees the &lt;a href="http://www.sophiapeacecenter.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sophia Peace Center&lt;/a&gt;. Visit &lt;a href="http://www.motherclarewatts.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MotherClareWatts.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about her, watch her videos and purchase her books.&lt;/p&gt;
