Come celebrate the most efficient form of transportation humans have ever created!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like, go ahead and have some fun decorating your bike, and/or posting it with signs that promote bike riding (and we'll have a bike decorating station at the Swap, too!)  There will be prizes for riders: Youngest Rider, Eldest Rider, Most Original Decorated Bike, Most Earth Day-Related Decorated Bike, and Most Flamboyant Decorated Bike.
