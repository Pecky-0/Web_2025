The weather is looking good for this very scenic trip. &lt;br /&gt;KGFL (Floyd Bennet Memorial Field) in Glens Falls, NY promises a beautiful 94 nm flight across NH hills, to just south of Lake George of New York State.  There's a rumor (actually verified by one of our members) that our friend and former Marshfield Airport manager Ann Pollard is now based at GFL As new manager of the FBO there (Rich Air), she's surrounded by gorgeous country, a renovated terminal.  You can bet she's brought the same friendly attitude with her to New York State.  See you there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't forget to ask your loved one or a friend to join you. Your not going to want to miss this one and don't forget that camera, we love pictures! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info at &lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KGFL" target="_blank"&gt;Bennett Memorial Field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary Archer</member_name><member_id>6716312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257970057000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257518762000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Glens Falls, NY for Breakfast</name><id>11811284</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257602400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/11811284/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/8/e/global_9323262.jpeg</photo_url></item>
