<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Over the winter, I offered this as a hike but we went off onto the Tunix Trail to make it challenging.  This will be a walk on the groomed nature trail through the preserve.  There are areas that have an incline but in general this is a nice 3 mile loop.  Maybe you will see the beavers out of their lodge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sessions Woods Walk, Burlington&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:  Saturday Apr 18, 1:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come take a stroll around a Wildlife Management Area.  There is a beaver pond, lookout tower, water fall, and summer house to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be an easy walk of about 3 miles on moderate ups and downs.  One long down hill and up hill.  Social walking pace.  We will be out for 2 to 3 hours.  Rain cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved.  You know best how your dog will react.  We could have a small or large crowd, and there may be other dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  341 Milford St, Route 69, Burlington.  Park in the lot to the left as you enter the driveway.  We will gather near the gazebo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Burlington&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=341+Milford+St#a/maps/m::10:41.733189:-72.953951:0:::::/e" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk is being lead by Larry.
