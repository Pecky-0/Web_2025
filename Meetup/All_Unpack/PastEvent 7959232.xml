It's easy to see why.. Reasonably priced drinks.... OH, try the Pomegranate Martini or Cosmo.. To die for! Food is innovative and excellent.. they feature the best local talent.   &lt;br /&gt;It's small... gets very crowded and warm. this all adds to it's charm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE: I will try to be there earlier to snag a table. If anyone can arrive earlier? that would be great: )  &lt;br /&gt;             I know this is a distance from Worcester area but thought I would include it in case there is  &lt;br /&gt;             interest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Jo&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the meetup table sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211764317000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Great local live entertainment</why><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211069529000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live Music &amp; Dancing @ Palmer's in Andover</name><id>7959232</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211590800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/7959232/</event_url></item>
