It was so much fun and I received so much positive feed-back so I decided that I would like to do it all over again.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the short notice.  I just got back from vacation and learned about the schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Samba Tremeterra&amp;quot; translated into English would mean something like &amp;quot;earth-shaking samba&amp;quot;.  Samba Tremeterra is an Afro-Brazilian music and dance group, and their shows are really fun and high energy with a carnival feel.  I hope that some of you will come and help us shake the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is more intended for the enjoyment of a cultural event than practicing the Portuguese language since this event will take place at a noisy bar/club.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are welcome and encouraged to practice their Portuguese, however I just wanted to warn you that this event may frustrate people whose main intention is to practice Portuguese. This is not a formal Portuguese language practicing session, regardless there will be a lot of Portuguese speakers available and it will be a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about Samba TremeTerra visit the following web sites:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rylesjazz.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rylesjazz....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.capoeira-angola.com/pages/sambatrem.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.capoeira-a...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, do not forget, there is a $10 cover charge.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me or a "Portuguese Meet-Up" sign at one of tables close to the stage.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231889668000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228781125000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tremeterra at Ryles</name><id>9304461</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229220000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/9304461/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/2/0/global_6569920.jpeg</photo_url></item>
