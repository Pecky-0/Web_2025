<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a 1.5 to 2 hour hike through the forest surrounding Black Spruce Pond in the Goodwin and Natchaug forests. It's a lovely area with lots of wildlife and interesting plants. We'll probably see beaver lodges, waterfowl, deer, and signs of lots of other creatures :) You'll want hiking boots or at least solid walking shoes. It can be muddy at points, especially if we've had rain recently. The terrain is mostly footpath, some dirt roads, with gentle rolling hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place we'll meet to gather up is on this map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/education/goodwin/goodwintrailsmap.pdf"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/education/goodwin/goodwintrailsmap.pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the intersection of Eleventh Section Road and Estabrook (Esterbrook on the map), just east of Black Spruce Pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet up at 1.45 and hit the trail by 2.00 sharp :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs are welcome, but please say if you plan to bring one (my two terriers will be there as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it rains heavily this will be postponed. If it's just misting/drizzling and people are still interested, we'll still go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to get in touch with me for status, please ring 860-634-6541 between 11am and 1pm that day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the turnout by the corner of Estabrook and 11th Section Roads on the Hampton/Chaplin border.
