&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I think we've narrowed it down to Miller's Ale House in Watertown and Dillons on Boylston, but the best choice, I think, seems to be Miller's. It has less blaring music, better prices, and WAY more parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont want people to feel pressured to order food or stay longer than they intended. So a casual atmosphere is definitely best, as well as cheap drinks! Miller's Ale House in Watertown has a great atmostphere, a casual dining experience, cheap food/drinks, FREE parking, and dining coupons available online! Its a little bit off of the T, but if you're comfortable with the bus ride to Watertown mall or the short drive down Arsenal, we'd love to see you there!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab a drink and sit to chat, order some of their infamous wings (so I've heard) or stay &amp;amp; order a $12.99 steak special. So I think it's pretty reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe next time we can do something that is a bit more "sit-down" formal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEET: INSIDE AT BAR - we will have a sign on the table!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEN: 715-730 on June 16 - We'll probably stay until about 9pm or so, depending.&lt;/p&gt;
