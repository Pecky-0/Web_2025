Outline of basic usage.  Setting up a repository, edit, add, commit.  Branching, merging and rebasing.  Working with multiple repositories.  How Git works under the hood.  Various other tools including log and diff.  Neat and interesting features of git including bisect, reflog, and hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the talk, we'll discuss source control systems in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a long-time SVN user, I know I'm interested in learning more about Git.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Benjamin:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I am an open source developer and have contributed to many projects including git, my own browser Arora, a library for the netflix contest and others.  I worked for Trolltech hacking on Qt for three years and am currently employed at RIM.  &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>the bottom floor of the building has a large hair salon named "Fia".
