Want to pitch a tent with like-minded people?  Want to Camp for Justice?  Okay!&lt;br /&gt;We're headed to Quechee State Park in White River Junction, Vermont from August 3rd to 5th.  Head up Friday morning or working folks can carpool up as soon as you punch out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a special SoJust event that we are doing to gear up for our 1-year anniversary.  If you've found yourself not wanting SoJust events to end and more time to get to know the cool people you've met through SoJust, this is your chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several tentsites have been rented (we need exact numbers so be sure to RSVP!) where you can drive your car up, or leave your car in the parking lot and just bring your tent.  There are fire pits, indoor toilets, quarter-fed hot showers, picnic tables, dogs allowed (&amp;quot;on-leash&amp;quot;), pretty woods and a half-mile hike to the Quechee Gorge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quechee State Park is about 3 miles off of highway 89, and also near 91.  Googlemaps tells us it's 2 hours and 20 minutes from downtown Boston.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the Camping for Justice Thread to plan transportation, sleeping arrangements, dietary restrictions, and read more about Camping for Justice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://sojust.meetup.com/1/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3287914"&gt;http://sojust.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186425390000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184425221000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Camping for Justice</name><id>6023036</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186164000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/6023036/</event_url></item>
