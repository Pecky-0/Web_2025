It is about a plan to transform our nation.  John McManus, President of The John Birch Society, will conduct a presentation on the subject exposing the people in both political parties who are promoting amnesty and open borders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This event is free to the public but we need funds to help promote the event and cover fees.  Checks can be made out to JBS Speakers Bureau and sent to me at 12 March Ave. West Roxbury, MA  02132.  If you would like to advertise your business in our speaker's program, business card size ads are $25, 1/2 page $50 and $100 for a full page.   &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be using the main ballroom</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>harold shurtleff</member_name><member_id>3658665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277857176000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272914711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Expose on the illegal alien issue-a lecture by John McManus</name><id>13370598</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277852400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/13370598/</event_url></item>
