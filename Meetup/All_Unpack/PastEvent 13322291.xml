Each year, hundreds of runners in both the 10M and 5K enjoy a breathtaking course through the bucolic seaside town, running along the ocean for several miles before winding through a state park and charming New England neighborhoods. The Yankee Homecoming 10M and 5K are truly picture perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it has been for decades. And the tradition continues in 2010 as we celebrate the 50th year of the Yankee Homecoming Race.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you sign up then please mark a yes on here and also whether you're willing to carpool etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you...
