<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This month's meeting is entitled &amp;quot;ask the expert,  it might be you&amp;quot;.  Participants are encouraged to bring their toughest PHP question or topic for the group's consideration.  Some ideas might be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Security best practices (should be able to cover that in 5 minutes ;-);&lt;br /&gt;OO in PHP4 vs. PHP5;&lt;br /&gt;Proper file structures (where should those crucial includes go);&lt;br /&gt;.... you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, after any healthy technical discussion food &amp;amp; drink must follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  we're going to start at 6:30 to give folks more time to get from work into Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here  are directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bu.edu/it/directions/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bu.edu/it/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only change to the directions that is worth noting is that instead&lt;br /&gt;of going to the Front Office everyone should take the stair well down&lt;br /&gt;to the computer lab.  To the right after entering the lab are two&lt;br /&gt;doors.  The second door on the right is LCR (Left Conference Room).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.BostonPHP.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.BostonPHP.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1120777364000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston PHP Meetup August Meetup</name><id>4731876</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1123194600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/4731876/</event_url></item>
