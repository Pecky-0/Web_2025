It's a very nice restaurant, and we would like to give members from other parts of the state an easier ride.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building can be found at the intersection of Main &amp;amp; Washington Streets, but the entrance to the parking lot and restaurant is in the back, on Melilli Plaza. If memory serves, the first 2 hours of parking are free. Mikado is located in the basement level of the building. Very cozy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we had a large group and reserved the "party room"; perhaps if we have a large enough group (at least 10) we can do that again. It was more like a private booth with curtains, but it was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Anne's party.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>4725872</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323648795000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ct</urlname><id>900540</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven County Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1321809959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back to Mikado!</name><id>41826382</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323644400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ct/events/41826382/</event_url></item>
