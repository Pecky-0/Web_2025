Every week offers shoppers something different and unique - you won't want to miss it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The market hosts a wide variety of vendors, whether you're looking for hand-crafted accessories, original art, indie designer clothing or just a fresh loaf of bread, you'll find painters, sculptors, photographers, clothing and jewelry designers, milliners, handbag designers, house wares, florists, bakers, local farmer's produce and much more every week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SoWa Antiques Market will be the most exciting thing that’s happened to the antiques business in Boston since the days of the Fanueil Hall antiques market in the 60's and 70's when thousands would gather to purchase antiques and collectibles from local dealers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This market, in an historic trolley barn in Boston’s SoWa Arts District in the South End, will be the place to be on Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free admission and parking. Under cover rain or shine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sowa Antiques Market&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SoWa Art Walk is held every spring in the SoWa (South of Washington Street) neighborhood in Boston’s South End. A former mill building district where pianos, canned goods, shoes and other merchandise were made in the 19th century, the district has been home to artists’ studios carved out of the old factories for the last fifty years. Today, the artists have been joined by art galleries, creative businesses, cutting edge restaurants and residential loft buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SoWa Art Walk takes place in late May each year and is a weekend-long standing invitation to visit the artists in their studios. This year, the SoWa Art Walk will occur on Saturday and Sunday May 16-17, 2009 from 11:00am to 6:00pm. Creative stores, cafes, boutiques and some of the city’s finest restaurants take part in the SoWa Art Walk by opening their doors all weekend, hosting artists who display on their walls and offering special event discounts. The SoWa Open Market, an open-air venue for artists, craftsmen, collectioners, farmstands and other vendors makes its seasonal debut each year in tandem with the SoWa Art Walk. www.southendopenmarket.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, the SoWa Open Market will be joined by the Grand Opening of the new SoWa Antiques Market where over fifty antiques vendors will display in the fabled Power Station at 540 Harrison Avenue.  www.SoWaAntiquesmarket.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come stroll through one of Boston’s most vibrant and creative neighborhoods on a spring weekend and you’ll be sure to find a painting, original design/make clothing, a set of antique china … or brunch and plenty of atmosphere!
