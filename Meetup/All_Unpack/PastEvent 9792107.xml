Canoe along eight miles of the Ipswich River that run through the sanctuary and camp on Perkins Island, located a half-mile up the river (members can rent canoes from May through October). Members can also rent a cabin that is conveniently located close to the sanctuary’s office and program facilities and sleeps four. In April, listen for the chorus of American toads and pickerel frogs. Watch for river otters, painted turtles, and great blue herons at various times throughout the year. Climb the drumlin and esker, landscape features created by a glacier 15,000 years ago. Huge rocks and exotic trees and shrubs that were part of a former arboretum provide an adventurous walk along the Rockery Trail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Address:&lt;br /&gt;87 Perkins Row&lt;br /&gt;Topsfield, MA 01983&lt;br /&gt;978-887-9264&lt;br /&gt;ipswichriver@massaudubon.org&lt;br /&gt;This sanctuary has the following universally accessible facilities: Restrooms, Barn, Education Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the parking lot.
