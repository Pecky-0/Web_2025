We'll begin by meeting in downtown Portsmouth (I'll finalize a location later, but meeting for lunch is certainly an option) and then take a short drive to &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wanderineye/sets/72157594433736336/"&gt;Fort Foster&lt;/a&gt; where there are plenty of opportunities for seascapes, lighthouses, etc. We'll then head back to Portsmouth and the hardy amongst us can practice their night photography around town. The not-so-hardy (i.e. non native) can join me in a warmer place, such as the Portsmouth brewery to discuss &amp;quot;the one that got away...&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** As with all our events, please RSVP &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; if you do not want to hear about or receive messages about this event again. **&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1172011272000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1170383607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Afternoon seascapes and night photography</name><id>5445478</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1171821600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/5445478/</event_url></item>
