&lt;p&gt;This a flexible hike that can be lengthened if the group wants a slightly longer hike, but retains the possibility of some hikers opting for only half the distance.&amp;nbsp; The route covers a few dirt roads, plenty of forest trails, and a stretch on paved road.&amp;nbsp; The group will decide at the beginning on the exact type of hike desired but as always, the time a hike takes is not possible to predict precisely.&amp;nbsp; The pace is determined by the slowest hiker and stops for photos or snacks are always an option.&amp;nbsp; Estimated time is two and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring water and snacks for two- and four-legged hikers.&amp;nbsp; I like to use trekking poles for a full body working (and help on those hills) and hiking boots to keep out the sand and forest debris.&amp;nbsp; Dress for the weather with appropriate layers and rain cancels.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Troll</member_name><member_id>11017991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320684419000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319420435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buffett's Body Building hike for the November First Sunday Hike</name><id>38450712</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1320600600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/38450712/</event_url></item>
