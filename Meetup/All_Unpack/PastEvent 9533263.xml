We help each other in our goal to rebuild the fashion industry in Boston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP for February 19th meetup. We will have another panel discussion on various aspects of production, pattern design, fabric resources and fabric trimming, such as printing, embroidery, stencils, knitting, crocheting, etc. Enjoy light refreshments as you converse, connect, and network with fellow fashion entrepreneurs.  We encourage you to bring examples of your work, a positive attitude, enthusiasm, and the willingness to have fun. You may bring food to share as well. There is a $2 fee at the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January's meetup was the best yet, with 40 members attending. We had an exciting discussion on selling and marketing with a panel of nine members experienced in various aspects of selling and marketing in the fashion industry. Come in February and meet these members as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you all there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston Fashion Industry Meetup organizers&lt;br /&gt;Shirley, Ron, Jamall, Prithi, Constance, Tom, &amp;amp; Evan.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will greet you.
