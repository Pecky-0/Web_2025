They've been described as having "An atmospheric quality and intensity similar to Deftones, Queens of the Stone Age, or Muse. Without being pretentious, the band manages to write gorgeously moody rock thatâ€™s straight forward, pure, and will have you listening on repeat - Modern rock radio for non-douchebags"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They won the BMA rock artist of the year award in 2012. If you'd like to get a feel for their music, go here: &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Great Scott is at the intersection of Harvard Street &amp;amp; Comm. Ave., just a 10 min. walk from Coolidge Corner. The closest T stop is Harvard Ave. on the B line but Coolidge Corner on the C line is also pretty close.&lt;/span&gt; Doors open at 9 (which means the show will probably kick off around 10), tickets are $10 available at &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/01004A75C104BD3A"&gt;http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/01004A75C104BD3A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be at the bar around 9.30 pm in case anyone wants to meet up and grab a pre-show beverage. Please remember to bring a valid ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Simer</member_name><member_id>9830021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1366517674000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1366153898000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RIBS @ Great Scott 4/20, 9 pm</name><id>114691382</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1366506000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/114691382/</event_url></item>
