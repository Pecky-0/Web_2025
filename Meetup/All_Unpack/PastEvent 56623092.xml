&lt;p&gt;This walk will be a slightly shorter version of the Self-Guided Interpretive Trail walk described on the website for the forest, at &lt;a href="http://nrc.umass.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/wildlife-habitat-at-cadwell.pdf"&gt;http://nrc.umass.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/wildlife-habitat-at-cadwell.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will try a loop walk for about an hour and a half.&amp;nbsp; Lincoln Tower houses the antenna for WFCR, 88.5 fm - the New England Public Broadcasting station for the area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Amherst Center go east on Main St. through the intersection with North East St. At this point Main St. becomes Pelham Rd. Follow Pelham Rd into Pelham, past the Library to Enfield Rd on your right. Turn onto Enfield Rd and go about 2 miles. At a Y intersection, Enfield Rd becomes Packardville Rd. to your left. The gate and parking area are on your left about 100 yards beyond this intersection. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THERE IS NOT A LOT OF PARKING AVAILABLE SO IF YOU CAN CAR POOL WITH SOMEONE IT WOULD HELP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;About Cadwell Memorial Forest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UMass, Amherst Department of Environmental Conservation owns and manages 1,200 acres in Pelham, Massachusetts known as Cadwell Memorial Forest. The primary goals of this ownership are to provide an outdoor laboratory for teaching, research, and demonstration in ecology, forestry, and natural resources management. These forests are located in the central hardwood region of southern New England, but also include eastern hemlock and eastern white pine stands and several conifer plantations. This is a working forest, which includes the sale of timber and non-timber forest products from this property.The Cadwell Forest was established in 1952 through the generosity of Mrs. Frank A. Cadwell. The 1200 acres was an assemblage of the numerous woodlots her late husband had owned and managed from 1899-1935. After acquiring Cadwell Forest in 1952, the University of Massachusetts began to manage the property primarily for teaching, research, and demonstration. Small amounts of open land were planted with conifers. In addition, a variety of research activities were conducted, including white pine direct seeding experiments and studies examining the relationships between gypsy moths, oak forests, and small mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
