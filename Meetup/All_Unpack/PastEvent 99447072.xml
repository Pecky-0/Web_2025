&lt;p&gt;Buyin min: $60 Buyin max: $300 (or biggest stack @ table)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game has dedicated dealer, stocked mini-fridge with water &amp;amp; soda plus an extra mini-fridge if you'd like to BYOB. Pizza and snacks provided by host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weeks game ran until around midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a Bad Beat Jackpot (currently at $205 and qualifier is losing with Tens full or better) .  When the BBJ is hit, we pay 50% to the loser of the hand, 25% to the winner and the remaining 25% is split between everyone who played that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a $25 Button Bonus (when the game starts whomever gets the button will receive bonus starting cash to play!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If players are headsup you can run it twice (if both agree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No smoking inside, but you're welcome to smoke outside, plenty of off-street parking available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please park near the silver Camry and come in via the door on the side deck. House is on the corner of a four-way intersection, our driveway is near the fire hydrant. HUGE yard with a small shed and then a larger 3-bay garage/barn further back on the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: I have friends outside of Meetup that will be attending as well, so the RSVP list here won't represent the full number of players :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone is 860-597-3776 if you have any trouble finding us!&lt;/p&gt;
