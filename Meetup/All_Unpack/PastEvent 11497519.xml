There is just so much good stuff going on and in Boston so much to check out. So in an attempt to gain more exposure to more music through a collection of suggestions, I will be hosting a music meetup at my home. I think this could be an amazing opportunity to merge Ipod lists amongst other things and meet some of Boston's most charming. Indie music opens the gate to many other artistic avenues and this is a chance to help expose your favorite artists, side projects, etc to a whole group of new people. So bring you Ipod, mags, musical journals, whatever and come enjoy some free food, beer and the company of other Indie geeks and a free space to completely geek out. Perhaps from your suggestions to a meetup assistant organizer's ear will a new meetup be created. Hope to see you there! The 7:00 time is fluid, stop by when you can. If you have any pre meetup suggestions please feel free to let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jenn</member_name><member_id>10142965</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255479953000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254235222000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A  Merging of Musical Minds aka an excuse for indie music lovers to geek out</name><id>11497519</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255129200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/11497519/</event_url></item>
