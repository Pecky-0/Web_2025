Come, have a drink and watch the Celtics vs. Lakers game at John Harvard's Brew House in Harvard Square after the advanced and recreational volleyball meetups on Sunday.  It's within walking distance from the gym where we play, so it's a great post-volleyball activity (what says &amp;quot;healthy living&amp;quot; better than exercise and beer?!).  It'll go from 4:30 to whenever we decide to leave.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People not playing in the advanced or recreational game on Sunday are more than welcome.  Just be sure to RSVP and don't come looking better than those of us who didn't have time to shower after playing 2 hours of volleyball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured we could walk over from the gym after the games and others can just show up at the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Lakers fans are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lilly</member_name><member_id>10355700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296606553000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295996569000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Volleyball Sunday Happy Hour!</name><id>16185021</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296423000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/16185021/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/8/global_21066360.jpeg</photo_url></item>
