Father Peter is a priest and Master Teacher in the Mystical Christian tradition. The first seminar he is presenting here in New Haven is entitled &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Empty Place Inside - From Loneliness Into Love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know all-too-well that empty feeling inside, the ache of loneliness, the longing for SOMETHING that you can't explain? Even if you have a great companion, wonderful kids, a good life, and many friends around you,  does a shadow of loneliness still lurk in the background, haunting you? This seminar will awaken you to the reality of true companionship that lies within your heart. You will learn how you can take steps to create a life of inner fullness and deep joy, turning the sorrow of loneliness into a stepping stone for becoming your real self. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are invited to come experience an evening or a whole weekend of life-changing teaching in the setting of a peaceful and inviting spiritual center amongst the warm and vibrant people of the Center of Light community. You are welcome to come to a single event, and if you find yourself feeling at home, be welcome to come to many more. For these seminars, if you are new to us, we extend to you a special offer to bring a friend for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;About the presenter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes is the co-director of a mystical order and travels weekly year round, teaching students on the spiritual path, lecturing, and performing his music.
