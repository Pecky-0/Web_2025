<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Interested in climbing at Rumney this weekend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group is leaving Boston on Saturday morning at 10 AM with the intent to climb Saturday, camp Saturday night, climb Sunday, and come back  to Boston on Sunday leaving around 3 PM . At this point there is only one spot in the car leaving from Boston. If you have your own gear and ride, please feel free to come Saturday as well! Overnight accommodations not yet confirmed, but would require a sleeping bag or maybe tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also some interest to just come up on one day and meet us there for a day of climbing. If you can find a ride (see discussion board!), you can of course come and meet us in the parking lot in Rumney at 12 PM on Saturday OR 10 AM Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like nice weather (70-75 highs and cloudy, although could change of course). Word is that the bugs are out, so get your game face on  : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ROPE or GEAR, please bring it!!!!! Our ratio of lead climbers and gear to new climbers is a little bit low. `&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337621119000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Rock-Climbers</urlname><id>1496386</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>South Shore Rock Climbers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337010145000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rumney!</name><id>64731682</id><headcount>3</headcount><duration>104400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337436000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Rock-Climbers/events/64731682/</event_url></item>
