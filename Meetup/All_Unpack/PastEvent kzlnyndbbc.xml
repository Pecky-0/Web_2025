This is the night for you then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of us who have given readings will be able to share their strategies and preparation.  Those of us who are curious will learn.  All of us will receive at least one reading from someone and also have the opportunity to try it ourselves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you use them, bring your cards, runes, crystals and whatever other tools you wish!  Or just bring yourself... experience does not matter!  We are all in this together!  It will be fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, bring enough food to feed at least four people and be ready for great food, great conversation and a terrific time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dance in the light,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be greeting you!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266880395000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263686831000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Give a Reading, Get a Reading</name><id>kzlnyndbbc</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266706800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/12339550/</event_url></item>
