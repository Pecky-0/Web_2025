Changing beliefs is like changing the old into the new.&lt;br /&gt;If want to really win the game of creating wealth, well here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: You can have Success and Wealth or Excuses and Blame, but you can't have both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join today, these book up very fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... A dynamic 1/2-day workshop &lt;br /&gt;for busting through internal blocks to achieve greater prosperity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, January 22 &lt;br /&gt;1 to 3:30 &lt;br /&gt;Ideal Business Center &lt;br /&gt;20 Locust Street &lt;br /&gt;Danvers, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn the science of rewiring your brain for ongoing success! &lt;br /&gt;“Positive thoughts have a profound effect on behavior and genes, but only when they are in harmony with subconscious programming….When it comes to sheer neurological processing abilities, the subconscious mind is millions of time more powerful than the conscious mind.” –Bruce Lipton, Ph.D., The Biology of Belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Year's resolutions do not work! Instead, they place you on a roller coaster where you are up one day and down the next. You become afraid, fearful and you retreat into the SAME OLD SAME OLD. So what happens? You hide, you don't think about the person YOU ARE DESTINED to become. You get lost in the same bad habits, over and over again. You think to yourself &amp;quot;I know I can be more!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen carefully! There is a science behind becoming WEALTHY, being HAPPY and having a HEALTHY, LOVING RELATIONSHIP. That's right -- a science. That means a proven scientific way of rewiring the mind to BREAK THROUGH THOSE HIDDEN BELIEFS that do not serve you and teach your mind to accept and allow you to move with confidence toward your every goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Imagine waking up every morning KNOWING you can reach your dreams, with a vision so strong you are inspired to take the right actions to follow through towards the outcomes you desire. No longer will you wonder &amp;quot;What if?&amp;quot; Now your internal responses will be &amp;quot;I CAN,&amp;quot; “I CHOOSE,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I AM COMMITTED!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This half-day workshop will be taught by :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gail Kauranen Jones &lt;br /&gt;Intuitive Coach, Insightful Writer/Author and Belief Change Expert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Rescripting Success from the Inside Out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.SupportMatters.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GailJones@SupportMatters.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And By&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Pasquale &lt;br /&gt;Master Instructor, Entrepreneur &lt;br /&gt;Mindful Wealth Group&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Inspiring the Courage to be Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is only $50 (a $600 value if coached individually by both facilitators).

She is helping me replace the ‘old tapes’ in my head with life-changing ideas. The improvement I see in my everyday life is extraordinary.” &lt;br /&gt;—Margo Carey, software trainer and writer, Marblehead, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Gail Jones enlightened me.

She uses her proprietary Rewriting the Script technique which helps clients cut through emotional blocks and is the author of the courageous book, To Hell and Back…Healing Your Way Through Transition (2004).

I have not known him to 'think small'. He uses his own limitless potential in service to others, yet doesn't burden himself or others with stoicism; he is a living example of &amp;quot;enjoying the ride&amp;quot;!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcus Milukas CPCC, ACC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I have known Anthony for 4 years now. During that time, he has been a martial arts instuctor to my two young children. I have grown to have the highest respect for his character, integrity and commitment to our children as individuals, and our community as a whole. His drive and devotion to create a better environment ~ work, living or social ~ is tireless and inspirational. He and his wife have created a truly special, and even life-changing, place for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I was invited to become Anthony's business partner in a networking effort on the North Shore. I jumped at the chance. He's a big thinker, and does not consider obstacles. He is constantly streaming ideas to improve not only his business, but ours, and is always thinking creatively and collaboratively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my pleasure to recommend Anthony for anything he aspires to!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Hanson, Real Estate Consultant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Energetic and tireless, Anthony is result-driven and seeks to create a community of like-minded working professionals. Success is not measured only by financial gain but personal happiness and well being.” Glenn Scott&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come join us and see for yourself what this extraordinary event can do for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony Pasquale &lt;br /&gt;AJP Enterprise &lt;br /&gt;A Mindful Wealth Group &lt;br /&gt;United Martial Arts Center &lt;br /&gt;Osanna Seminars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Live with Purpose and Passion Everyday&amp;quot; !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.umachealth.com &lt;br /&gt;www.danversmartialarts.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.couragewit.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.couragewit...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideal Business Center &lt;br /&gt;20 Locust Street, Suite 100 &lt;br /&gt;Danvers MA 01923 &lt;br /&gt;(978) 836-6501&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It's remarkable, how much mediocrity we live with, surrounding ourselves with daily reminders that the average is acceptable. Our world suffers from terminal normality. Take a moment to access all the things around you that encourage you to remain &amp;quot;average&amp;quot;. These are the things that keep you powerless, unable to go beyond a limit you have arbitrarily set for yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anthony Pasquale</member_name><member_id>6925152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295723950000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New to Network Marketings</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Network-Marketing-Support-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1342126</id><group_lat>42.5699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9400024414</group_lon><name>Network Marketing Support Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294080721000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Inner Belief Boot Camp Series: To Greater Wealth!</name><id>15899694</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295719200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Network-Marketing-Support-Meetup-Group/events/15899694/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/1/global_7343345.jpeg</photo_url></item>
