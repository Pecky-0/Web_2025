If you have an alternate suggestion for some place that can handle 15-20 people and is a bit quieter, please speak up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll probably talk about the books, television, movies, comics and games that we like (and those we don't like, and even those we may be ashamed to admit that we like), but there is no set agenda!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Red Meetup sign!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom "spot" Callaway</member_name><member_id>2590946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249426286000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244639360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Social Meetup</name><id>10620512</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247007600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/10620512/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
