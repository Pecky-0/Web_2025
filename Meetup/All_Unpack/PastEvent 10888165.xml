No need to be nervous if you are not a fast bicyclist.  It's a social ride.  If you want to just do a portion of the ride, feel free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just as much about meeting some nice folks as it is about enjoying some fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;If it is raining â€“ I will reschedule for another day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blackstone River Bikeway is 10 miles of paved bike path from Lincoln through Valley Falls Heritage Park in Cumberland and ends in Woonsocket at the Water Treatment Plant on Manville Hill Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at The Blackstone River State Park, Front Street, Lincoln&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE&lt;/b&gt; remember to take my cell phone number: 401-699-7304 in case you can't find us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red road bike.
