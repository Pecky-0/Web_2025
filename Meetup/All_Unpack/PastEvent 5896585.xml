Things get very busy starting at 8pm when the Band arrives. We had a great time the last time we went there! Please try to be there no later than 8:15pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is free after 6pm in Central Square so you can look for the two municipal outdoor parking lots on Bishop Allen Drive (Norfolk St, Douglass St). The lot behind McDonalds/Quest Diagnostics is almost beside La Luna. The lot behind Blockbusters is very busy. There is an indoor parking garage on the corner of Green St and Pearl St with a max fee of $5 ($1/hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all!! &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183248066000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181953225000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jazz &amp; Lattes - Cambridge Central Square La Luna Cafe</name><id>5896585</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183075200000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/5896585/</event_url></item>
