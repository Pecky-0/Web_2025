Originally trained as an illustrator, he picked up his first camera in 1929. By the mid-1930s, he was the exclusive photographer of the new Boston Globe Rotogravure Magazine and the New England photojournalist for Life and Time magazines. During the golden age of photojournalism, the 1930s to the 1950s, he shot everything from street scenes to fashion, sports to celebrities, everyday life to war.
