&lt;p&gt;I originally intended this for the day before Valentine's Day;&amp;nbsp; but I realized that I need to allow more time for sign ups, so we'll make it a Belated Valentine's day workshop.&amp;nbsp; I've been playing with cut out freezer paper, ironed onto watercolor paper, and painted over...the result is a vivid white image on a multicolored watercolor background!&amp;nbsp; It's a quick and fun way to make some instant Valentines...and we can have our own Valentine exchange as well, if anyone's interested.&amp;nbsp; Or use our resist cards as a basis for some jamming.&amp;nbsp; And there will be plenty of opportunites for experimenting with the technique:&amp;nbsp; On Beyond Valentines!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMENITIES:  Free parking. Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper  cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven,  kitchen sink and restroom. Dinner in or out, if people are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COST: $15 to help defray the Studio rental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND: Any member of the NE ATC+ or Altered Art/Assemblage Meetups and their guests (18+ only, please).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW  TO SIGN UP: These smaller sessions are often full with a waiting list.  Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. You may  RSVP for a guest as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your plans (or your guests'  plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly. Please do this right  up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT TO BRING: Most of the supplies will be provided (included in your cost for attending)&amp;nbsp; If you have favorite basics, by all means bring them.&amp;nbsp; But basic supplies -- scissors, glue, tape, blank ATCS,  etc. -- are available for your use. Even if you show up empty-handed,  we can get you started on projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CANCELLATIONS: In the  unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even if we're just getting a  late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone  who's RSVP'd "yes." So to be on the safe side, please check the Web site  and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360!&lt;/p&gt;
