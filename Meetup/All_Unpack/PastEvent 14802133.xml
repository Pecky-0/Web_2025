Dogs must be leashed at this venue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the parking lot near Merrymount Park in Quincy. You can use the address 1284 Quincy Shore Drive, Quincy, MA.  There's no real building around that address to mark it, but if you're coming from Boston, the parking lot that we'll meet in is all the toward the end of Quincy Shore drive before the Furnace Brook Parkway intersection.  If you're coming from Quincy center, the parking lot is on the left AFTER the Furnace Brook Parkway intersection.  Here is a set of lights right at the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stephanie googled the address and it shows the parking lot on the arial map, so it should be an ok address to put in.  We can meet in the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking lot, Stephanie has white dogs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephanie</member_name><member_id>12859926</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286229813000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284727768000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wollaston Beach Walkway</name><id>14802133</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286116200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/14802133/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/5/global_17982549.jpeg</photo_url></item>
