These marshlands and ponds attract over 100 species of bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is located on Kendrick street, between 3rd and 4th avenues.  Kendrick street in Needham begins where Nahanton street in Newton ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dress for the occasion, including sturdy, water-repellant boots (or even waterproof if you're interested in poking aroung the rim of those marshes).  There are boardwalks provided, but I cannot guarantee there won't be spots that may have experienced mild submergence (This will be my first visit as well, and Spring can be a soggy season.).  Plus, the wonderous charm of this environment may beckon us off the beaten path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also bring binoculars, magnifying glasses, field guides, and other provisions so that you may adequately scrutinize and comprehend the glories of our natural world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>my vehicle:  red jeep with big wheels</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6025746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209953072000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>There'll be marshes!
