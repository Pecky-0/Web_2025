Mike? Andrew? Phil? Come to the Oct. Meetup and see them DUEL TO THE DEATH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW LOCATION: Thanks to Phil from Shazamm, the Providence PHP Meetup has a new home at the swank Shazamm studios on Branch Ave. in Providence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup is growing by leaps and bounds, so come out to Branch Ave on Oct. 3rd and keep the momentum up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO GET THERE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shazamm Studios&lt;br /&gt;715 Branch Ave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their office is the building in front of the big mill building next to Providence bicycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bike shop should be closed during the meetup so people can park in that lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to walk down an alley between the mill building and Shazamm to get to the door.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Shearer</member_name><member_id>1529786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540593000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>PHP Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>php-338</urlname><id>282097</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Providence PHP Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1159920294000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence PHP Meetup November Meetup</name><id>5171990</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1162944000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/php-338/events/5171990/</event_url></item>
