Learn how to turn your kitchen scraps into gold (and keep that organic material out of the &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; stream!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portland location (TBD) 6:30 potluck and 7:00 announcements + presentation | wrap-up around 8:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to bring your potluck kit (plate/utensils/cup/napkin) and a dish to share for supper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Mark:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Composting builds soil and conserves resources, but outdoor composting&lt;br /&gt;in winter is a challenge. Indoor composting with worms is a great&lt;br /&gt;solution. Mark Follansbee (WormMainea) will demonstrate how easy it is&lt;br /&gt;to get started. In addition to a hands on how to, you will learn how&lt;br /&gt;to build a worm bin for less than $15 and keep your bin trouble-free.&lt;br /&gt;Mark will also cover feeding and monitoring your bin; harvesting worm&lt;br /&gt;compost as a soil amendment; and making worm compost tea. There will&lt;br /&gt;be time to answer questions and address rumors and myths about&lt;br /&gt;vermicomposting. Mark will have compost worms and worm bins available&lt;br /&gt;for purchase, as well as free instructions available. About me: I have&lt;br /&gt;a PhD in Pharmacology and work in Scarborough as an environmental&lt;br /&gt;scientist/toxicologist. I have been vermicomposting since 2000 and, as&lt;br /&gt;a hobby, I operate WormMainea. I have been teaching others to&lt;br /&gt;vermicompost successfully since 2005&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285802204000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281460107000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vermicomposting with Mark Follansbee</name><id>14379571</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285713000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/14379571/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/d/global_17102493.jpeg</photo_url></item>
