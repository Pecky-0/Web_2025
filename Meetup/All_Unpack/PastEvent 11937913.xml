After Dec 1st, the discount is still 25% for a while, so still worth doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the 30% discount, it's down to a &lt;b&gt;$419&lt;/b&gt; and for that you get &lt;b&gt;60-mins in a real race car&lt;/b&gt;.  Having done something similar up near Toronto, I can certainly say this is a great experience!  That was cheaper, but this is much, much closer and won't involve as much travel costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To purchase at the discounted rate, follow these instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO RESERVE YOUR SEAT&lt;br /&gt;Promotional pricing is not available through online registration. To reserve your seat in a program at the discounted rate please call 866.227.2375, Monday through Thursday from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm Eastern, and Friday from 8:00 am to 5:30 pm Eastern.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details of the course itself here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skipbarber.com/racing_school/formula/introduction_to_racing.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skipbarber...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And details about the track here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skipbarber.com/locations/lime_rock_park.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skipbarber...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to be able to drive a manual in order to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On &lt;b&gt;May 20th, a 8:00AM and 9:30AM&lt;/b&gt; session are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone will be responsible for own travel arrangements, though if there is enough interest, we can certainly consider car pooling and splitting the cost of gas, etc.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Luff</member_name><member_id>6620811</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274457021000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Racing Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>racing</urlname><id>1209048</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>Racing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258984226000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intro to Racing - Lime Rock Park, CT - Real Race Cars!</name><id>11937913</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274356800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/racing/events/11937913/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/1/global_11954033.jpeg</photo_url></item>
