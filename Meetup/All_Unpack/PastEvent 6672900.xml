No Depression calls his songwriting &amp;quot;tasteful, intelligent and sensitive...unpredictable as a bead of mercury.&amp;quot; With the advent of his fifth CD, &amp;quot;Hope and Other Casualties,&amp;quot; Mark is already being touted as one of America's most promising singer/songwriters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening for Mark Erelli will be Meg Hutchinson. Among her many honors, Meg has won the New Folk Award at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas, as well as awards at the Rocky Mountain Folks Fest, the Telluride Troubadour Songwriter's Showcase in Colorado and The Chris Austin Songwriting Contest at Merlefest in North Carolina. Meg will release her first Red House Records recording, Come Up Full, in early 2008. This fall she will be touring throughout the northeast supporting John Gorka, Susan Werner, Catie Curtis and others. For more information visit www.meghutchinson.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mark Erelli show is taking place the same weekend as the Ten Thousand Villages Fair Trade Festival at the church, which will be open an hour prior to the show and during intermission. Ten Thousand Villages markets quality products from diverse cultures around the world made by artisans who have received vital, fair compensation for their handicrafts. Get a headstart on your holiday shopping for exquisite gifts, musical instruments, toys, jewelry and home decor - hand crafted in bamboo, stone, wood, ceramics, textiles and other natural fibers, crafted by artisans from around the world. All proceeds from the sale go back to Ten Thousand Villages to help them continue their vital work around the globe. www.tenthousandvillages.com.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $16 in advance, $18 at the door. Last year they let me email them my RSVP list 2 days in advance and would let those people pay the advance price at the door. They could always revoke my privilege if I get too many no-shows or if they expect a sellout. You can also pay them via paypal. Coffee and snacks are available there, for a suggested donation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.uunashua.org/simplegi/index.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.uunashua.o...&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.uunashua.org/map.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.uunashua.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you arrive late I can't promise to hold a seat for you with us. I'm listing this event with other groups too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll wear my baseball cap that says NEIL so you can recognize me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Organizer Neil&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195357968000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
