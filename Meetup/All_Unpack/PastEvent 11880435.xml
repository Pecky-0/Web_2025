In the 1990’s he was among the first to expose the origins and motives behind ‘Outcomes Based Education.’  His recent experience as a substitute teacher in 38 schools in Connecticut was an eye-opener and confirmation that chaos in the classroom is a major factor contributing to a general breakdown of the educational process. Please consider attending to hear his first-hand experience inside public schools where our children are targeted for purposes other than learning the ABC’s, the motivation behind it, and the mechanics of implementing the stealthy takeover of public education by socialists who are engineering our children as 'human capital.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the holiday season, we need to be out of the room by 7:15 SHARP!!! So please arrive on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone and Merry Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Patriotism,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim and Ginny Copeland</member_name><member_id>10195645</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260573165000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258319565000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NCC Bi-Weekly Meetup - Speaker John Puzzo Will Discuss The Demise Of Education </name><id>11880435</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260399600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/11880435/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/4/global_10345540.jpeg</photo_url></item>
