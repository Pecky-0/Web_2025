Bring a contribution for dinner (appetizer, entree, or beverage) and your favorite game for the group!  It's Janice's birthday, so dessert is also being provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is jointly listed with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group and alreay &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;has more than 59 people signed up!&lt;/span&gt;  They won't all be tall, but come on out and party with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Games: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have already: &lt;br /&gt;* Pictionary &lt;br /&gt;* Picture Picture &lt;br /&gt;* Worst Case Scenario &lt;br /&gt;* Trivial Pursuit &lt;br /&gt;* Scene It &lt;br /&gt;* Jenga (well a knockoff version) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd like to see someone bring: &lt;br /&gt;* Bolderdash &lt;br /&gt;* Cranium &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring any other game you might think 4 - 6 people at least could play at the same time. Team games of 2 -3 would be great too. Note this is an indoor game night in a clubhouse with a kitchen area. We are not doing horseshoes or lawn darts!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplied already: &lt;br /&gt;* Paper and glass products &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan to bring to share: &lt;br /&gt;* Finger food &lt;br /&gt;* Snacks &lt;br /&gt;* Small entree (plan to feed 5 people!) &lt;br /&gt;* Drinks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Birthday: &lt;br /&gt;You don't have to bring a present. Janice just appreciates seeing and sharing fun with her friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is at a hall at a condo complex in South Windsor.  The address will be sent to those who respond &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;  or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; about a few days before the event. We would appreciate donations of any amount (maybe $2?) to help offset the cost of the hall rental. Donations can be made at the event. We all hope you can attend and enjoy a warm evening with great people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263251382000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>63</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257986322000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck dinner and games night</name><id>11854548</id><headcount>63</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263078000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/11854548/</event_url></item>
