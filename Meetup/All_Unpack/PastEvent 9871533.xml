To the ancient Celts, it symbolized the coming of spring. It was the time of year when &lt;br /&gt;the crops began to sprout, the animals bore their young and the people could begin to get out of the houses where they had been cooped up during the long dark cold winter months. May Day celebrations were banned during the reign of the Puritans in England but were revived when the Puritans lost power, and it is now a day of joy and making merry, especially for children. Many May Day celebrations feature dancing around the Maypole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no class this week&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>with the congregation</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245421312000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236109292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beltane (May Day) Celebration</name><id>9871533</id><headcount>250</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241361000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9871533/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
