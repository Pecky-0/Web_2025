I've heard their tour staffs are really knowledgable and friendly. So we should come up with some good questions for them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first sunday tour starts at noon, and we can start gathering around at 11:45. I called the place and was told that it's a small brewery, and we'd better show up first thing in the morning when they open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The website says &lt;a href="http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/index.cfm/page/TastingsTours/pid/28488" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.harpoonbre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Guided tour of our Boston Brewery followed by a tasting of Harpoon beers.&lt;br /&gt;You will be guided through the brewery on a tour with our staff and learn how Harpoon makes all of its beers. After the tour, all visitors over 21 years of age will enjoy samples of Harpoon and UFO beers.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 5 dollar tour fee, so make sure to bring cash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can either drive (there is a parking lot right next to the brewery) or take the silver line SL2 bus to &amp;quot;Silver Line Way after Manulife Building&amp;quot; stop (its the 4th stop)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for Sun (I'll also email you my number)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>15</waitlist_count><updated>1242501247000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238771582000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harpoon Brewery Tour/Tasting</name><id>10106315</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240760700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/10106315/</event_url></item>
