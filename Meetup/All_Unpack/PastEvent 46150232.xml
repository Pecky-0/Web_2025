Behind the newly renovated Lowell mills where I live is plenty of space to run off leash, walk, play, etc. Also, the yard leads to a wide walkway that runs along the river and connects to the. Tsongas Arena grounds where there is even more space to run and play, as well as plenty of trees, paved pathways and picnic tables. This area is not private and people walk their dogs here everyday, as do I! I think it'd be a great place for the little ones to interact!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1339866904000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Dog Folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Chelmsford-Lowell-Pug-small-dog-meet-up</urlname><id>1553224</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Chelmsford/Lowell Pug &amp; Small Dog Meet-Up</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325436333000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A simple get-together where we can walk our little ones or just let them play!</name><id>46150232</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339855200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Chelmsford-Lowell-Pug-small-dog-meet-up/events/46150232/</event_url></item>
