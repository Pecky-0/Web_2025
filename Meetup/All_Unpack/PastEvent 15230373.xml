<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>8:00 AM is the hike start time. Carpooling location listed below will be meeting at 6:00 AM. This Saturday hike will be to Mt Paugus (south peak 3000+ ft. and listed as a 52-with-a-view peak) as well as a bushwhack to the true summit (3198' an off-trail distance a little over 1/4 mile each way). The bushwhack (which will be the best part of the hike) is optional, but if you decide not to do it, you will need to wait at the south peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike will be out of Frencroft and be on the Kelly and Lawrence Trails. It is 4.1 miles each way -- out and back hike. Vertical climbing is right around 2000 feet. That's 8.2 total for the South Peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Given the time of year, traction is required** Microspikes are best. I have some spare equipment but you must clear this with me before the hike. Otherwise I expect all participants to have traction. Snowshoes are also on the gear list. If you sign onto this hike we will discuss snowshoes via email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a gear list is based on Michael Blair's excellent list (thanks) - and is to be considered the MINIMUM amount of things to bring on this trip. Don't expect someone else will have extras of anything: you need to carry all the stuff you will need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Footwear: Hiking boots. Light traction is mandatory (microspikes strongly recommended, yaktracks or stabilicers will probably suffice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clothing: Dress in layers to easily regulate body temperature. Wear synthetic shirt/pants and bring a fleece jacket/wool sweater - ABSOLUTELY NO COTTON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outerwear: Waterproof/windproof rain jacket with hood, rain pants, hat, gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food and Water: High-energy snacks, food for lunch, and at least three quarts of water (electrolyte drink recommended - cut it in half or third with water as they have so much sugar and you will crash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Essential Gear: Map and compass. Plastic whistle. Headlamp with two sets of spare batteries. An emergency space blanket (e.g. mylar). Small pocket knife or multi-purpose tool. Toilet kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items). Sunscreen. Lip balm. Sunglasses. Insect repellent. Waterproof cover for your pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optional Items: Waterproof gaiters. Trekking poles. Camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I will bring a group first aid kit that contains basic items I am not certified or trained in wilderness first aid. You will need to bring any medications or medical supplies that you may need during the trip.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will find you</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew B</member_name><member_id>4803051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291506798000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288065458000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intermediate: Mt Paugus snowshoe (hopefully) hike - Save the date</name><id>15230373</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291460400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/15230373/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/8/global_6139736.jpeg</photo_url></item>
