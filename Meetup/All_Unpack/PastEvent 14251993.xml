<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;October Update:&lt;/b&gt;  In order to make this event more managable, and the &amp;quot;transformation&amp;quot; more effective! - we are splitting the permablitz into two parts.  The 10/10/10 work party will be Part 1: Focusing on the permaculture design (workshop style) at the start of the the day, and then installing some season extension beds and other sheet mulch garden beds and planting some edibles.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Part 2 will take place late April/early May 2011 - the perfect time to plant more edibles, check in on our previous plantings, install rain water collection and a small water feature (and possibly a henhouse and other features to be confirmed over the winter!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is being coordinated as one of the thousands of 350.org Global Work Parties happening around the planet on 10/10/10.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To read more about 10/10/10 in general go here:  &lt;a href="http://www.350.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.350.org/...&lt;/a&gt; and see past 350.org Maine-related photos: &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=maine&amp;amp;w=25654955%40N03" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.flickr.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To read more about permablitzing go here:  &lt;a href="http://www.permablitz.net/what-is-a-permablitz" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.permablitz...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schedule:&lt;br /&gt;8:30 Gather/Coffee/Tea/Briefing on Work Party Plan for the Day&lt;br /&gt;9:00 Review of Permaculture Design Principles and Homeowner Needs&lt;br /&gt;10:30 Break into teams (front/back/side) and work on projects&lt;br /&gt;12:30 Potluck Lunch (homeowners to provide a vegetarian soup and we bring complimentary items)&lt;br /&gt;1:00 Resume work &lt;br /&gt;3:30 Check-in &amp;amp; prioritize final hour / clean-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to bring!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a notebook, camera (if desired), work gloves and boots.
