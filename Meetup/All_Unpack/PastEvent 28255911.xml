  &lt;strong&gt;BABY Itsy Bitsy Yoga Class Description (newborns to pre-crawling):&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Baby Itsy Bitsy Yoga classes contain dozens of unique yoga postures designed to support baby&amp;rsquo;s development. Each class is filled with calming, nurturing ways to enhance bonding and improve baby&amp;rsquo;s sleep.
 &lt;br /&gt;During a Baby Itsy Bitsy Yoga class, babies enjoy yoga while on their backs, tummies, or held in loving arms. For parents, this class is a special opportunity to meet other parents in the community, and learn about baby's emerging personality. Most of the yoga we do in Itsy Bitsy Yoga is for your baby, but you will also learn breathing and relaxation techniques as you practice a bit of yoga yourself.
 &lt;br /&gt;No yoga experience is required. Thank you for arranging just 1 parent/caregiver per family.
 &lt;br /&gt;
