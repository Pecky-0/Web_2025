The monday night training will emphasize cardio and core. Come ready to good workout, wear athletic shoes, comfortable clothes and bring water. The park is along the Charles River directly across from the Day's Inn in Brighton. The closest bus route is the 86 but for an added work out you can always bike/walk along the Charles River Bike Path. just look for the group dressed in work out clothes. After training we will go for some local food and drink.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316474575000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316218755000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ski Fitness Bootcamp</name><id>33860822</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316469600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak/events/33860822/</event_url></item>
