Reviews on Amazon are mixed... but we all liked White Tiger, so this one is a must-read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Bookmarks Magazine&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by Balzac's La Comedie Humaine, Adiga intended to write a portrait of Indian life; as such, place and theme, rather than characters, tie together these 14 stories. Each starts with a travel vignette -- a daylong walk around a different section of Kittur -- that introduces the town. But, as he did in The White Tiger, Adiga soon delves deeper to focus on class and caste inequalities and characters &amp;quot;paralyzed by their powerlessness&amp;quot; (Newsweek). His meticulous descriptions of men, women, and children from all walks of life offer insight into modern India, one where few such as these experience redemption. Some reviewers commented on the unevenness of the stories and the lack of overall plot, but all agreed on Adiga's important role as &amp;quot;a sensitive chronicler of modern India&amp;quot; (Telegraph). &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorothy Drennen</member_name><member_id>2879015</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292267740000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Indian Bookwalas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-1439</urlname><id>1261834</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Indian Food, Indian Fiction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282492874000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December 2010 - Between the Assassinations by Aravind Adiga</name><id>14501711</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292086800000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-1439/events/14501711/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/4/global_5395668.jpeg</photo_url></item>
