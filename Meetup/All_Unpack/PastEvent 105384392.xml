POSSIBLY THE FIRST WEEKEND IN MARCH BUT WILL CONFIRM NEXT WEEK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, esteemed colleagues. It's time for the 2013 SLED DOG RACES! Wooohoooooo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal. The Lakes Region Sled Dog Club (lrsdc.org) holds its races this weekend - I am planning for Saturday. I spoke to the organizer and she said we could photograph at the start/finish line - the race runs through and around downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first race begins at 8:30 - we should arrive by 8 a.m. I will plan to meet those of you going at the start/finish line. The next race doesn't begin until 12 noon and the final one of the day is at 1 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-between, there will be great shots of people, dogs, the town, dogs, more people, dogs. You get the point. After all, it is a sled dog race. There are coffee shops and pubs - depending on the time of day - or who cares about the time of day, we can stop in either or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us did this 2 years ago in Tamworth and it was great fun. Best advice: dress warmly. Hope to see you Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
