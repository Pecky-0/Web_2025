I'm talking about hiking circles around the downhillers by circumnavigting Mt. Sunapee. We'll be off piste via a variety of hiking trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encompassing over 2900 acres, Mount Sunapee includes three mountains, a small lake (Lake Solitude) and many brooks scattered through the woodlands. A variety of wildlife can be found in the park, including deer, red fox, coyote, wild turkeys, ruffed grouse and hawks. Occasionally black bear, moose, bobcats, and fisher cats feed in the area although sightings are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start the hiking in the main parking lot and follow the Red Blaze of the Summit Trail to the summit, naturally. The start of the Summit Trail can be found on the right of the Lower Ridge ski trail, behind Sunapee Lodge. Once at the top we'll venture down the Newbury Trail and check out the Rim Trail. We'll circle back to the summit and descend past Lake Solituude and down the Andrew Brook Trail (Blue Blazes) to the end on Mountain Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll need to have some cars here so this will be the place where we meet at 9:30 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions: Route 89 North to exit 9 NH-103 toward Warren/Bradford. Bear Right onto NH 103 W to Between the Mountains Road. Landmarks: Look for Sweet Maples Sugar House, pass Brookdale Rd on left and then&amp;nbsp;make a hairpin turn to the&amp;nbsp;left onto Between the Mountains Road. Continue South to the Andrew Brook trail head on your right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trail conditions are funky. No new snow to speak of in a while so what's there has warmed up during the day and then frozen overnight. The footing will be crunchy and uneven. Micro spikes will be needed. There is a 30% chance of light snow on Saturday so I'd bring the snow shoes but we probably won't need them. Temperature high of 25 degrees and low 14 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
