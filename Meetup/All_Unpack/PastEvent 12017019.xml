We've foregone our normal meeting structure for this very special morning. Enjoy breakfast, festivities, and a gift swap. Bring one or two items that you have received as a gift, and are looking to re-gift, or something you bought for yourself, and later decided you didn't need it. We all do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to bring extra business cards, because you'll have plenty of time to network! Remember to utilize our area in the back of the room for displays and and freebies as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP by Monday, December 14, 2009.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Allison Biggs</member_name><member_id>10438666</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264090381000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Womens-Business-Owners-Alliance</urlname><id>1525453</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>Women Business Owners Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259939892000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Breakfast Meeting and Gift Swap</name><id>12017019</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261053900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Womens-Business-Owners-Alliance/events/12017019/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/d/global_10758349.jpeg</photo_url></item>
