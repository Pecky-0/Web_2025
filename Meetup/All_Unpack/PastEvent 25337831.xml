&lt;p&gt;Feel free to come join me for a bite to eat around 7:30 and then after that lets head off to the dance floor, or just come to dance later on no cover charge!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Please if you are able to come let me know if you will be there for dinner or just dancing as I will do my best to accomodate a table big enough if i know who is coming, the RSVP's are greatly appreciated :) This meet up is posted on several other sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

This group is not only for singles, couples are alslo welcome to join the more the merrier.&lt;/p&gt;
