But since I'm going, it's only fair to let everyone else know about it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/philadelphia-rally/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ronpaul200...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rally will take place at the Independence Mall in Philadelphia (there could not be a better place! ) on Saturday, November 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizers are hoping to draw upwards of 5,000 for the rally so mark your calenders! Ron Paul will be the keynote speaker (of course) and there will also be other speakers possibly including but not limited to Jacob Hornberger, Lew Rockwell, Karen Kwaitkowski and Michael Badnarik. This is taking place on Veterans Day weekend and I have heard that some of the &amp;quot;Veterans for Ron Paul&amp;quot; will be speaking at the rally too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to make car arrangements using comments in your RSVPs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542544000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194365209000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rally in Philly</name><id>6688406</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194717600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6688406/</event_url></item>
