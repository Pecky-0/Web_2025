<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Bill has graciously offered to host at his place in Arlington. He has a drum kit and piano (Yamaha p70), so no need for pianists or drummers to bring their own stuff (drummers, please do not bring your own kit b/c it can't be moved. I'm sure a couple of cymbals is fine though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note the new time and address. Since Bill plays drums, we won't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; another drummer, but as always, I hope a bassist can come. Other drummers are of course welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to cap the RSVP list at 7, but if you play something small (like a horn), email Bill so see if he can accommodate you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call Bill @ 781-316-1996</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed</member_name><member_id>7538494</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256236679000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Jazz Fans/Musicians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>jazz-190</urlname><id>1202977</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Cambridge/Somerville/Boston Jazz Meetup/Jam</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244599075000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jam at Bill's House</name><id>10617863</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247353200000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/jazz-190/events/10617863/</event_url></item>
