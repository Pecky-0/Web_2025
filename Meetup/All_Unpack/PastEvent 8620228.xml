<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our meetups are an occasion for friendly discussion.  The people who come are bright, lucid, open, and forthright.  Some people are more politically active than others.  There's no specific political activity requirement and there is no partisan angle. Libertarians, traditionalists, even objectivists are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to having new members come.  Discussion is interesting, please bring your views, your self. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth Monday of each month, at varying locations. This month at Cottonwood Cafe, Berkeley at St. James. in the Back Bay.  Weather permitting, we will be at an outside table (Indian Summer?). &lt;b&gt;The topic this month will continue our sharing of great books: what books on politics or political philosophy have been meaningful to you, either classics or recent titles.&lt;b&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thurman Smith, organizer &lt;br /&gt;781-388-9386 &lt;br /&gt;Cell  Sep 22nd 6:00 to 7:15 pm only 781-571-3740&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the maitre d' for the "meetup group"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>THURMAN SMITH</member_name><member_id>1416920</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225151392000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Conservatives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>townhall-61</urlname><id>155655</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Conservatives' Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219709156000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Conservatives' September Meetup</name><id>8620228</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222126200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/townhall-61/events/8620228/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/1/9/global_3409561.jpeg</photo_url></item>
