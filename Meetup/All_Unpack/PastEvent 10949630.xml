There are various options in different price ranges so hopefully this will work out well. Because we could possibly have 20 people, I have made a 7:00 reservation for a party room. It's basically a large table in a semi-private space. You will need to take off your shoes but you can leave your socks on if you want to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please please PLEASE be as close to on time as possible, and please update your RSVP if your situation has changed. There are people on the wait list who would like to come if you can no longer make it, and I'd also like to have a good idea of head count for Sunday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok all, here is the September meetup! Email me if you have questions. Also please remember that we ask for a $1 donation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be there with my copy of the book.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264377265000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248454900000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Meetup: Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay</name><id>10949630</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253487600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/10949630/</event_url></item>
