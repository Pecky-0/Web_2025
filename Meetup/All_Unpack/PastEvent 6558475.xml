Satisfy your hunger while listening to music from TWO wolves...Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Erich Wolfgang Korngold (&amp;amp; more), as part of the free &amp;quot;Bach's Lunch&amp;quot; series at New Haven's &lt;a href="http://www.nmsmusicschool.com/"&gt;Neighborhood Music School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be there by noon, music starts promptly at 12:10 (don't be late!). Be sure your cell phone is off (vibrate-only isn't good enough). If you can't stay until the end just be sure to leave in a break between music when others have started applauding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's ok to eat at the concert but please keep it quiet. Crinkly bags/wrappers and big celery stalks wouldn't be great choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOST: &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/members/2469731/"&gt;Alexis&lt;/a&gt;, cell 203-747-9203. However, she won't be answering her phone starting an hour before the concert, and obviously not during it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POST-PARTY: After the performance feel free to say &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; and simper &amp;amp; fawn over them. There will definitely be a post-party...TBD, but it is 100% certain that Mark and Alexis will most definitely want to eat and drink after the concert (they are fond of Anna Liffey's), people are welcome to join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hear Alexis playing some Mozart at her site: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist"&gt;www.myspace.com/alexiszingalepianist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING: Don't expect to find parking on Audubon St. (which is a 1-way street). Grove &amp;amp; Whitney have street parking, and there are &lt;a href="http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/ParkingAuthority/images/map.gif"&gt;parking garages&lt;/a&gt; in the area (such as on Grove, &amp;amp; on Audubon).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193587334000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192527810000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fri 10/26-Are you hungry?
