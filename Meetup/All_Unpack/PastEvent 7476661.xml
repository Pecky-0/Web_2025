Trivia is no longer at the Wave on Friday's (so sad!!), but we were offered free pool tables from 7-9PM!  Karaoke is still on at 9pm and the DJ is really good!  They have a pretty decent beer selection, but more importantly, there's tons of parking in the lot.&lt;br /&gt;Email me with any questions. :)  This is a joint event with New England 25+ Social Fun.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wavesportspub.com/default.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wavesports...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be at a table with Katelyn and near or with Biagio (see his picture on N.E. 25+ group).
