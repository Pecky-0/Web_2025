<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;span style="color: green"&gt;&lt;b&gt;++++ Saturday 9:30 am Update +++  This event is ON as planned regardless of weather today! +++&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for a special meetup to learn from some of the experienced bee-keepers in our permaculture group!  We will convene about noon, start with a &lt;b&gt;potluck lunch&lt;/b&gt;, then learn about beekeeping from Michael and Winnie, get advice about starting with bees, valuable lessons learned, etc. (for a couple of hours) and then mid to late afternoon actually go into the hives with Michael Robinson (weather and bee temperment permitting...I hear they are very nice bees at the Robinson household).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain date is May 10th, same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People should wear light colored clothing, no perfume and bring their helmets if they have them.&lt;br /&gt;Potluck:  Bring a main dish or side dish if you can.  Don't forget to bring your potluck kit (plate/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meetup software is mapping this as Gorham but it is really Buxton!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Here is the real map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;oe=utf8&amp;amp;q=149+Simpson+Rd,+Buxton,+ME+04093,+USA&amp;amp;ll=43.584246,-70.549521&amp;amp;spn=0.027387,0.05373&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210003847000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><why>Join us because this is an example of members of our own group sharing their expertise with the rest of us as we build our skills for the future.</why><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204144533000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Intro to Backyard Beekeeping in Maine</name><id>7420473</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209830400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/7420473/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/9/global_3456361.jpeg</photo_url></item>
