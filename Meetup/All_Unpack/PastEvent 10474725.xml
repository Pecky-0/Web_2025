<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A couple was group were nice enough to help provide a location in Boston to have a 4th of July party.  This is a private location, so the address will be sent out just prior to the event.  Since this is a private location, the address will only be sent out to members who have attended at least one event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to make this a potluck/BBQ.  There is a deck with a grill and really nice view of Boston.  Bring food and drinks to share.  Alcoholic drinks are allowed and recommended.  When you make your RSVP, please make a comment saying what you will be bringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deck doesn't have views of the fireworks, but after the pot luck, we can move somewhere to watch the fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have allergies: There are cats that live at this location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>More details will be sent out closer to the day of the event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noelle</member_name><member_id>4227453</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247359852000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243047587000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fourth of July Potluck and Party</name><id>10474725</id><headcount>34</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246744800000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/10474725/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/3/global_7135059.jpeg</photo_url></item>
