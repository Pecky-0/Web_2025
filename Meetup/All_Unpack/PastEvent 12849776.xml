The event starts at 6:00 and goes until we leave! The owner is putting on an event to draw in new patrons who may not be familiar with the restaurant. There will be a wine tasting from an organic Chilean vineyard (3 reds and 3 whites), amazing food and great company - I promise!! There is also a band after the event if you would like to stay. The website to the restaurant is www.encorenprov.com where you can get the address information (1058 Charles St, North Providence) and an idea of the ambiance. This is a pay at the door event and the cost of $30 includes the 6 glasses of wine and tons of amazing food that the owner is preparing special for our group! Can't wait to see everyone there!
