<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Due to the high elevation of the trail head, Caps Ridge Trail provides the shortest route and least elevation gain to a high Presidential peak. However, this trail is far from easy as the traverse of the rocky Caps involves some fairly difficult ledge scrambling, and the upper half of the climb is fully exposed to wind and weather.&amp;nbsp; It can be very slippery during&amp;nbsp;wet weather.&amp;nbsp; The views&amp;nbsp;are worth the hike though, and if you like scrambling and a challenge,&amp;nbsp;you will not be disappointed. &amp;nbsp;We will continue over the summit and take a scenic loop around S side of Jefferson for incredible views of Mt. Adams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total hike about 6.0 miles,&amp;nbsp;2700- ft elevation gain. Bring plenty of water, snacks, lunch, and hiking boots! It can get&amp;nbsp;windy at the summit, so make sure you bring an extra layer to wear at the top, plus rain gear. Pouring rain postpones but drizzle/showers will not. No dogs/children please. Note that there's a $3&amp;nbsp;parking fee per&amp;nbsp;vehicle at the trail head so please have the right amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a level four hike for&amp;nbsp; experienced hikers, due to steep elevation gain and rocky ledge scrambles. We will be moving at a moderate pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is about a&amp;nbsp;4 hour drive from Providence without traffic.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;will email my cell phone number for members who are participating.&amp;nbsp; If you have any questions, pelase email me or John&amp;nbsp;through this site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
