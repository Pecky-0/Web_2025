<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Since there are only 2 RSVPs with a week to go, this meetup is now open to everyone (i.e. ladies too). I've heard good reviews about this movie - lots of action and some good one-liners. We'll catch the &lt;em&gt;8:10pm&lt;/em&gt; show at the Boston Common Loews in Downtown. This is the 2nd weekend the movie's been out and the weather is great so plan to get there by 7:30 to get tickets, food, and good seating. If there's interest in hanging out after the movie, we can find a spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking: Free street parking after 8 so if you find a meter around 7pm, the most you'll pay is $1.25 (bring quarters). There are several lots under $15 for the night. For those taking the T, the Orange, Green, and Red lines all pass through Downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Us:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be by the ticket-taker who's in front of the upstairs escalator until 7:50pm. Text me at 617.595.3537 when you get to theater as it's a big place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always check the event page the day of the meetup to see if any details changes. Last minute changes will be posted to the site and sent via email to those that RSVPed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cabral Thomas</member_name><member_id>9824758</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346041615000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>businessnetwork-960</urlname><id>1253532</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Professionals of Color Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343501060000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Night Out: Expendables 2 + Loungin'</name><id>75301332</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345851900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/businessnetwork-960/events/75301332/</event_url></item>
