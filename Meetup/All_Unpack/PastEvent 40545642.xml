<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This has been a fan favorite for the last couple of years.&amp;nbsp; We get together at my condo club house and enjoy an evening of games and great food brought by all of you.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;is a fun way&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;break up the long nights and to socialize with other hikers.&amp;nbsp;This event will be held at Janice's condo complex clubhouse&amp;nbsp;in South Windsor. We'll have a large fireplace with fire, music, tables &amp;amp; chairs, bathrooms, and full kitchen available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the games we have already: * Pictionary * Picture Picture * Worst Case Scenario * Trivial Pursuit * Scrabble * Fact or Crap * Jenga (well a knockoff version) We'd like to see someone bring these as well as anything else: * Bolderdash * Cranium * Cards (for various card games) Bring any other game you might think 4 - 6 people at least could play at the same time. Team games would be great too. Note this is an indoor game night. We are not doing horseshoes or lawn darts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplied already: * Paper and glass products Please plan to bring to share any of: * Finger food * Snacks * Small entree (plan to feed 8 people!) * Drinks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hall Rental Donation, We would appreciate donations of&amp;nbsp;$5 each person to help offset the cost of the hall rental. Donations&amp;nbsp;will be made at the event so be prepared with cold hard cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The address will be sent to those who respond "Yes"&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;day before the event. If you sign up last minute be sure to e-mail Janice&amp;nbsp;for directions. There is always movement those last couple of days with RSVP. Limitation on RSVP's is due to parking limitations. We all hope you can attend and enjoy a warm evening with great people. Last year this was a hit with over 60 people going each time and people brought great food and drinks to share!&amp;nbsp;If you RSVP "yes" and later can't go, please remember to change your RSVP so someone else can go!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, yes, there will be a birthday game event January 7, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
