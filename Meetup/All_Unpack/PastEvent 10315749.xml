Several of the members told about how they are bringing raw back to their families and in just a short time have seen a difference in their children.  Everyone bring a dish of your choice!  When you have decided what you want to bring list it on the message board so we don't get 15 of the same salad!  Salad is great just not all the same!  If people are really stuck give me a shout and I will help with ideas.   You don't have to do anything elaborate or crazy....just please make it organic.  KO's is a safe place to eat...no added chemicals!  I hope to see all old and new members!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247264787000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241222892000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food June Meetup</name><id>10315749</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244242800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/10315749/</event_url></item>
