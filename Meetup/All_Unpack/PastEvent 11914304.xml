This will be pot-luck style because I can only cook for so many people. We know how tough it is to watch loved ones tear into that turkey or maybe you don't have anyone to share the day with.. so you should come celebrate a cruelty free day of thanks with us! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great if, when you RSVP, you can leave a comment about what you plan to bring so we don't have 15 green bean casseroles. And the sooner you can respond the better, just so we know how much seating we need, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a long drive and wants to sleep over, we have plenty of room and lots of floor space too. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259433728000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258666868000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thanksliving dinner at my place :)</name><id>11914304</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259260200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/11914304/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/6/global_11642230.jpeg</photo_url></item>
