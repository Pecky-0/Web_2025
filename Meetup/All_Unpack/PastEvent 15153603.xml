Have you ever wondered why sometimes they succeed and other times they fail?  Are there “secret” methods you can use to improve your negotiation skills so that not only do you get what you want, but your partners get what they want as well? In this workshop, by the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE), you will learn how to uncover underlying interests and mutually beneficial opportunities to create win-win solutions in even the toughest negotiation situations. The workshop will be highly interactive with several small group learning activities.  In addition to hands-on learning, these group activities will give you the opportunity to quickly meet and interact with other participants in a fun, engaging manner, leading to future opportunities to deepen these relationships and expand your network.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joshua Lang</member_name><member_id>3926861</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288824650000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Scientific Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nexusproject</urlname><id>1294865</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Nexus Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287450237000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ISPE Negotiation for Success</name><id>15153603</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288819800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nexusproject/events/15153603/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/c/global_12600668.jpeg</photo_url></item>
