The facts open for discussion include: at 5:20 p.m. that same day another building, the 47 story WTC 7, completely collapsed within 70 feet of its footprint in 6.6 seconds. These three buildings became the first such structures to ever suffer complete collapse due to fire and damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film closely examines one of the world's worst catastrophes from a civil engineering perspective. Using photo and video footage as well as expert scientific testimony, the film thoroughly examines the official reports, offering varied criticisms of the official findings, while raising a more plausible hypothesis. The findings from these scientific experts have been quietly ignored by both government investigations and the mainstream media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one stop on a tour of New England. The filmmaker, Michael Berger, will entertain questions after the showing of the film and discuss where to go from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copies of the film on DVD will be for sale along with other related materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is open to the public; A suggested donation of $5 per person is requested to help cover costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a friend or skeptic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://improbablecollapse.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://improbablecoll...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also promoting the event on MySpace; feel free to RSVP there, as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://events.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.detail&amp;amp;eventID=321613.19388&amp;amp;Mytoken=D1C9641C-6371-40FC-B1291613BBE31A9419741236" target="_blank"&gt;http://events.myspace...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional showings in New Hampshire are happening at the following locations and times:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEENE STATE COLLEGE - Putnam Theater and Lecture Hall&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, April 12, 2007&lt;br /&gt;6:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dover Friends Meeting House&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, April 19, 2007&lt;br /&gt;7:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilton Town Hall Theater&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, April 22, 2007&lt;br /&gt;4:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a nice color flyer you can download and print to hand out! &lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/images/resources/Poster%20color-All%20NH%20events.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.911truth.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B&amp;amp;W&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.911truth.org/images/resources/Poster%20bw-All%20NH%20events.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.911truth.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeremy</member_name><member_id>3581956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177110627000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175403062000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Film Showing: "Improbable Collpase: The Demolition of Our Republic"</name><id>5624817</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176937200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/5624817/</event_url></item>
