 &lt;br /&gt;

 In response to the 2012 "One Day, No Religion" campaign -- as at &lt;a href="http://february20.org"&gt;http://february20.org&lt;/a&gt; -- it was been suggested that the BA sponsor a de-baptism evening. The results of the membership poll at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/polls/258567/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/polls/258567/&lt;/a&gt; were in favor of the event, so here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Members can expect to enjoy the usual food and drink fare off the Beerworks menu. The program will consist of some introductory comments by the evening's host, before we move into taking turns saying a few words, each of us, by way of public repudiation of our former condition as baptizedÂ Christians. Then we'll have our&lt;/span&gt; baptism&lt;span&gt;-moistened foreheads dried off by blowdryer. Bring a camera, dress to impress -- this is a solemn&lt;/span&gt; occasion&lt;span&gt;, friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call or text if you can't find us: 617-935-4951.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362261996000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1345485730000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Atheists De-Baptism Party</name><id>78560702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361404800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/78560702/</event_url></item>
