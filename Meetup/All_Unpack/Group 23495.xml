Then this is the place for you!  Come socialize with friendly book-loving people who would love to hear about what you're reading, share their thoughts about books, and share their books too!  Most members are enthusiasts of the website BookCrossing.com, though you are welcome even if you are not familiar with the site. (But check it out! You'll love it!) We don't read a specific book each month -- just read what you like, and tell us what you think about books, reading, publishing, writing, genres, plot structures, and all manner of miscellaneous literary topics. All bibliophiles welcome!</description><rating>4.64</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1034097745000</created><lat>42.3800010681</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>666</id><urlkey>bookcrossing</urlkey><name>Bookcrossing</name></topics_item></topics><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name><id>23495</id><members>381</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>220016</member_id><name>Liz</name></organizer><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/8/8/600_923944.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/8/8/highres_923944.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>923944</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/8/8/thumb_923944.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Cambridge</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/</link><lon>-71.1299972534</lon></item>
