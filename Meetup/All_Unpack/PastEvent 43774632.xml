I'll be bringing my dog, so we'll stick to the leashed dog side of the beach, and I won't be going through the dunes since dogs are not allowed. Plan on a fairly quick walking pace....15 minute mile? We'll walk for 1.5-2 hours (basically down the beach and back), and it looks like it might be more on the "normal December" temperature side- so dress accordingly (especially since it will be cooler on the coast). My schedule that day is such that I won't be able to host any post-walk social gathering, but if anyone wants to step up and organize the group after, feel free :)&lt;/p&gt;
