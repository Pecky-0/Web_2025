The ride runs along 3 miles of restored streetcar track from East Haven to Short Beach. It's a great way to end 2007 in style, as the very next day is the last day trolleys will run until April '08! Do you know where you'll be in April '08? So come enjoy a night on a historic tram, with friends, and learn a bit about New Haven's history!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night rides run from 6:00 to 9:00 PM. Tickets are $8 and are good for unlimited rides between 6-9pm. I plan to get to the museum in East Haven (the road is across the street from Bank of America, near the intersection with the fire department and Stop N Shop) at around 6:30p. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol is not permitted on the premises, but the early end-time certainly won't interfere with your evening plans. Rumor has it that Santa might make an appearance, so bring your wishlists! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have room for two additional passengers in my car, and will be leaving the Howe/Dwight/Chapel St area at 6:15p. If you need a ride/want to carpool, let me know in your RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!
