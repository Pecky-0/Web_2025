Sooooooooooo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS Tuesday, June 22 is the date. Shrewsbury Street is a wonderful place with many eclectic restaurants and shops. Here are the details.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 40 restuarants and pubs in the Shrewsbury Street (Worcester) neighborhood will participate. A button, $25 - is your admission to sample the food served at literally dozens of fine dining establishments. My two favorite places - Mezcal &amp;amp; The Flying Rhino are on the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buttons can be purchased at the restaurants or at branches of Flagship Bank and Bay State Savings Bank. I'm not sure how they serve the &amp;quot;tastings&amp;quot; but it sounds like a fun evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest we meet at 5:00PM in the bar area at Brew City Grill to begin our journey up Shrewsbury Street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can have a subsequent meet time of 6:15 @ Mezcal for those who can't make the 5:00 start . The Brew City Grill is at the bottom of Shrewsbury Street - the end closest to the railroad station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277292809000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276950889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Taste of Shrewsbury Street</name><id>13847256</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277240400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/13847256/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/b/6/global_15808790.jpeg</photo_url></item>
