We're doing it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SATURDAY August 15, 2009 3PM - 6PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can join us in rhythm and spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drumconnection.com"&gt;The DrumConnection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet other local Hand-Drummers who are interested creating community through the rich history of Africa and it's people. Drum Circles are a great way to stay connected to our inner rhythms. You'll learn some new rhythms, get some technique help and meet some great people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will come together at 3PM - 6PM at The Charles River. Please bring some food to share if you can. Check after NOON to see if we had to move this indoors due to rain. All you have to do is call. Please call 781-648-0066 for further info or just come! Bring your drums or use ours. We will have plenty of drums and bring some yummy food and drink to share. On the day of the circle call 617.686.6080 / my cell. Alan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we have a grill! So veggie burgahs! Bring stuff! Potato Salad was GREAT last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE bring a CHAIR! Like an office chair with no arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donations: $15.- each. Children under 12 - Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent feedback...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Had a wonderful time.... The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ” &lt;br /&gt;Irene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ This was a fun time. Alan's leadership style is loose, offering suggestions and some instruction. Nice group of people, too.”&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ It is the best drumming circle in the area! People really come together in a community, and with a community spirit. Instruments are provided if you don't have one. ... ” &lt;br /&gt;A former member&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drumconnection.com"&gt;The DrumConnection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll welcome you at the door! ...and make sure you are very comfortable.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>1328052</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251576707000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drummers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DrumConnection</urlname><id>886763</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>The Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250275659000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Drum Circle Meetup and Bar-B-Que! - Come Celebrate!</name><id>11112960</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250362800000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DrumConnection/events/11112960/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/2/6/global_3485414.jpeg</photo_url></item>
