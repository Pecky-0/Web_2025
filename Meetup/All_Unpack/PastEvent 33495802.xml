On one route there are historic landmarks that are marked with descriptions. There is also an overlook with a very pretty view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Sorry to those from Mass, I know it is far, but it is a nice hike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Here is the description from the website:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;VALLEY FALLS PARK TRAILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;There are 8.5 miles of blazed trails in Valley Falls Park, as well as a playground, picnic pavilion, toilet facilities and a swimming beach. The park is located on town property. Portions of the park contain ruins of textile mills and a early trout hatchery and have been declared a national historic site. The park is heavily used for swimming, picnicking, hiking, x-ctry skiing, fishing, wild flower and wildlife observation and a scenic vista. The park is a favorite place for activities with mentally and physically challenged groups. The park is located only 2.5 miles from a commuter parking lot at exit 67 on I-84. No bicycles are allowed in this park because of past trail damage caused by heavy bike usage (rallies). Trail construction and maintenance is done by Vernon Parks and Recreation, Boy Scouts and volunteers from the Vernon Land Trust and The Friends of Valley Falls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah F</member_name><member_id>11056594</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316450021000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1315996969000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hike at Valley Falls</name><id>33495802</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316358000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/33495802/</event_url></item>
