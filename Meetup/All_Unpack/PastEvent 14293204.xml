Mark comes from a corporate background and Caryn spent her 'first career' as a professional racquetball player, attaining a #1 world ranking. They now have a combined investing experience of over 20 years and have both been investing full-time for the past ten years. About seven years ago, Mark and Caryn began delving into pre-foreclosures and soon thereafter discovered a large niche that many investors seem to be afraid of bankruptcies. The more they learned, the higher their profits soared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Mark and Caryn are a national voice on bankruptcies as they share their experience and knowledge across the country. Their easy-going, straight-forward approach to teaching what investors need to know about this untapped lead-generaton niche comes from &amp;quot;in the trenches,&amp;quot; real-life experience. Investors are thrilled to discover that it is possible to &amp;quot;remove the fear,&amp;quot; simplify bankruptcies, and use this untapped market as a resource for a consistent and reliable source of income!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most notably, Mark and Caryn have developed a new, 4-CD audio/video product to assist investors in any market in finding the incredible leads available through this bankruptcy niche... from the comfort of a home computer. So if you want to check out a valuable, non-competitive niche like bankruptcies, you're in the right place.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Baumgarten</member_name><member_id>6320255</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282086391000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Real Estate Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctreia</urlname><id>989128</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>CT REIA - The Connecticut Real Estate Investors Assn.
