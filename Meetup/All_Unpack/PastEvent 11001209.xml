But after the Enlightenment, it’s quite likely that we’ll skip over a century or more and move directly to the Humanist Manifesto of 1933, when modern Humanism, at least modern American Humanism, took what was arguably its first concrete shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about the nineteenth century, and the first third of the twentieth? Didn’t anything worth mentioning happen then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our featured speaker for August will be HAC program chair, Dr. David Schafer, who will answer this question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start with a half hour of coffee and conversation at 7:30 PM. David's talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251329160000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249052665000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting - The Missing Years in the Evolution of Humanism</name><id>11001209</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250551800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/11001209/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/a/global_9954938.jpeg</photo_url></item>
