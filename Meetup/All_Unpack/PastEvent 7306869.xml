Refreshments will be provided.  Fees for this meetup also cover airfare and accommodations for our speaker Mother Clare Watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The topic for this meetup is the Joy of Being Single:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So often, we look to others to bring joy and happiness into our lives. Although it is true that partnerships of all kinds is a gift and a source of happiness, true joy comes from a feeing of contentment inside ourselves, which no one else can provide. This seminar is for couples and singles alike. We will discuss the art of spending quality time alone- which can include ecstatic bliss, connection, and acceptance, whether we are with someone or not. Love is all around us. We just have to tap into its presence and feel it within our own beings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sounds good to you please also note these additional seminars with Mother Clare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, February 15th:  Love, Sex &amp;amp; God ($25)&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, February 16th:  Devotion - The True Path to God ($35 includes lunch)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203208871000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Whether you're single or in a relationship this workshop is for anyone looking for a deeper sense of connection.
