&lt;p&gt;Call if you get lost: Meghan 617 595 1855&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a work in progress and spend an hour or two writing with other writers. Take the opportunity to discuss new ideas, encourage each other to meet self set goals, share websites and resources... Or just focus on your writing and see how much you can get done with a little dedicated time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO: bring something to work on! While there's usually at least some discussion, most people will be focusing on getting writing done. If you aren't writing at least a little, you'll probably be bored. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DON'T: rely on availability of power outlets and wifi. The Pru does have free wifi but it often doesn't work. Power outlets are very limited and usually we cannot manage to sit near one. Consider bringing a backup pen and paper!&lt;/p&gt;
