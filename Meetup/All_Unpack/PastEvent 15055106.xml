Taking this concern seriously, &lt;b&gt;we will address the implication that so-called premodern traditions actually have valuable teachings and contemplative practices composed from second tier altitudes that can be recovered from a truly Integral platform.&lt;/b&gt;  This can reinvigorate our engagement with the philosophical perspectives and spiritual approaches of the past while honoring and assimilating them into a creative vision for the future role of Religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A student of religious studies and Indian philosophy, &lt;b&gt;Ben Williams&lt;/b&gt; is currently a PhD candidate in South Asian Studies at Harvard University, and is working on the intersection of aesthetics and theology as articulated by the intellectual visionaries of medieval Kashmir. Initially exposed to Integral thought (Ken Wilber's writings) and evolutionary spirituality (Andrew Cohen's teachings) in 2004, and a committed student of a contemporary Guru-lineage since age 19, Ben's spiritual and intellectual work has been largely engaged in finding a new synthesis that clarifies and honors the contemplative traditions of India in the light of a dawning integral worldview and culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Schmanko&lt;/b&gt; has a Masters degree from Naropa University in Religious Studies and a background in secondary education as a former high school English teacher. He is currently pursuing a second Masters from the Harvard Divinity School, studying South Asian religious traditions and interreligious theology, with the larger goal of cultivating integral paradigms for contemplative education and practice.  Mark became a dedicated student of meditation and Eastern philosophy in 1999, after having a powerful encounter with a spiritual teacher in a contemporary Hindu lineage.  In 2003 while at Naropa he began studying closely Hindu Tantra, Integral theory, and evolutionary spirituality, and has since been deeply influenced by working with such teachers as Rabbi Miles Krassen, Sally Kempton and Dan P. Brown.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ted</member_name><member_id>1467536</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289320750000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286640192000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Second-Tier Hindu Tantra?: Today's Role of a “Premodern” Contemplative System</name><id>15055106</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288912500000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/15055106/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/f/global_7098607.jpeg</photo_url></item>
