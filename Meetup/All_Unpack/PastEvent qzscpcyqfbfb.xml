This class would concentrate on tricks, moves and sequences with the ultimate goal of one day having a performance team! ALL breeds, sizes and ages welcome! Helpful, but not completely necessary, to have attended a few Drop-Ins to have worked on attention to handler and basics like sit &amp;amp; down. Dog must have some very basic skills and may not be aggressive. Come one, come all! This is going to be a BLAST! Cost is $20 per dog per Drop-In! Join the start of something great :)............................... What I would really like this to turn into is a solid group of dogs who can perform at events, assisted-living homes, schools and more! You can see snippets of some of the moves on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/NEBBCSoldiers" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/NEBBCSoldiers&lt;/a&gt;. Hope to see you there! Classes will start after the first of the year and be every Saturday at 10:00a at Lucky Dogs Daycare (80 Sumner Street, Milford).
