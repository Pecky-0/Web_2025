Set in a small Kansas town, it's the story of one family and the horrific events of long ago that still haunt the people so closely involved.  It's the story of lies, half truths and redemption.  There's one problem...I didn't realize that this book was not yet out in paperback.  I checked for all our other criteria but missed this most important point.  I apologize to all of you who have to buy the hard cover but I suggest you go onto Amazon where there might be some used copies.  Hopefully, our local libraries will have copies, also.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We read a terrific book for October, &amp;quot;Cutting for Stone&amp;quot; by Abraham Verghese.  Don't let the title or the book's description fool you.  The characters were exceptionally well drawn and the medical aspect of the book was wonderful.  If you have time, we strongly suggest you read it.  It was highly thought of by all of us and that's certainly a first for our group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck finding &amp;quot;The Scent of Rain and Lightening&amp;quot; and we'll see you at the end of November.
