&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;James A. Gaudino, Sr. will&lt;/span&gt; present his stock dividend capture strategy to the group. James is from Sarasota, FL and is just in town for a short time. He has a PowerPoint presentation prepared. I consider his system to be credible (though of course not without risk, which is true of all trading systems). James has a live-trading track record with a very impressive annual run rate, which he will share with you in the meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This meeting is free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you decide to opt into James' program, the fee that he showed me was very low as trading program services go. This is a stock trading program though James does also trade options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James' phone # is &lt;a target="_blank"&gt;941-536-8424&lt;/a&gt; and his Meetup contact page is: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonTraders/members/11031166/" target="_blank"&gt;www.meetup.com/BostonTraders/members/11031166/&lt;/a&gt; from which he can be emailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His web site is: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;a href="http://www.MoneyMakesLifeEasier.weebly.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.MoneyMakesLifeEasier.weebly.com/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James will be marketing this plan to the public in time. His interest in presenting it to our group is to get some feedback and beta testers. He has his own software that he uses to analyze trades. This is not an automated program, but it's also not a sit-in-front-of-the-screen-all-day program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please attend if you would like to help run a monthly meeting. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
