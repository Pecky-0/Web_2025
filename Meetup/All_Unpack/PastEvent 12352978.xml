These masters of technology were charged with bringing the latest movie installment of Stephanie Myers' bestselling novel to the big screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Matt Jacobs and his team at Tippett Studio created New Moon's realistic-looking wolves with computer-generated imagery (CGI), a process that included getting up close and personal with fanged timberwolves at a California preserve in order to study their looks, movements, and behavior. The task of creating most of the other visual effects in the film, including the diamond-like shimmering of vampire skin coming into contact with sunlight, fell to Eric Pascarelli and his team at Prime Focus VFX. The source of their inspiration? Greek Thassos marble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;With behind-the-scenes stories and film clips demonstrating the process, these masters of technology, both from award-winning visual effects studios in California, illustrate how creativity and science combine to convey emotion, create drama, and bring New Moon to life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Seating is limited. Seating passes are available to the general public in the Museum lobby beginning at 5:45 p.m. on the evening of the program; first come, first served.

Maher to pick up for our group. T.J. should be standing in the front lobby by 5:50 pm if you want to grab a ticket, or if you are a Museum of Science member, you can reserve your own tickets if you wish. Although the doors will not open until 6:45 pm for the general seating, by 6:30 pm they will allow a few of us to go upstairs and reserve seats for our group.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Tippet Studio&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tippett.com/?q=node/173" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.tippett.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In 2009 Tippett Studio marked its 25th year in visual effects. From humble beginnings in their garage, in 1984, animation pioneer Phil Tippett and partner Jules Roman founded the company which now employs up to 225 artists and technicians occupying four buildings in Berkeley, California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Phil Tippett, a stop-motion innovator who was once in danger of extinction in the burgeoning field of computerized visual effects, has instead become one of its most enduring figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;After the Star Wars Trilogy, the Studio began as a stop-motion animation company -- designing, building and animating sequences for the CBS series Dinosaur and for movies like Robocop, Robocop II, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Ghostbusters 2. Many of the artists at Tippett today were first inspired to pursue their craft by the work coming out of Tippett Studio when they were just youngsters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In 1991, the Studio rose to the challenge of creating computer graphic (CG) animation for Steven Spielberg's seminal Jurassic Park. To link the stop motion animators and CGI animation a “Digital Input Device” (DID) was created as a bridging technology utilizing tiny sensors to translate stop-motion movements into the digital realm so that the animators could generate CGI animations for the first time. That innovation earned a Scientific &amp;amp; Technical Achievement Academy Award® and moved Tippett Studio into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In 1995, Tippett Studio exploded from its crew of 25 into a now customary 200 digital animators, lighters, compositors, engineers and production staff. The challenge: to produce 230 VFX shots for director Paul Verhoeven’s 1997 science-fiction cult hit Starship Troopers. Groundbreaking technical achievements for Troopers were used to create huge battle scenes with hundreds of alien arachnids swarming the landscape, and were precursors to current crowd-simulation technology. This work resulted in another Academy Award® nomination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In the years since, Tippett Studio has spanned all genres, from horror fantasies like Guillermo del Toro’s HellBoy, to family films like Disney’s Cats and Dogs. Tippett also added to its ever-widening range of services, from charming character animation (Enchanted) to complex environments and layered FX work for films like Constantine and Matrix Revolutions. Clients now include all of the major studios, most notably Disney, Summit, Paramount, Sony, Warner Brothers, Universal and Walden Media. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;More recently, Tippett produced sequences for J.J. Abrams on Cloverfield, seamlessly integrating multiple effects layers into that film’s infamous 'hand held' style, as well as designing and creating its iconic creature&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Matt Jacobs, visual FX Artist&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jacobsworks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://jacobsworks.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;In 1997, Matt began working at Tippett Studio in Berkeley, California as a rotoscope and 2D paint artist on the film Virus.  He spent a brief period at Industrial Light and Magic doing digital plate restoration and roto work on Star Wars Episode 1 in the fall of 1998.  Thereafter, he returned to Tippett to work as a compositor on such films as Blade 2, Mission To Mars, and Hollowman.  In 2002 Matt led his first crew of artists as lead compositor on Men in Black 2.  His biggest challenge was still to come.  As lead artist Matt was to oversee 12 artists and nearly 150 shots for the much anticipated Matrix 3: Revolutions from the fall of 2002 to the summer of 2003.  This was a rewarding career challenge that required wearing many hats: look development, training artists, overseeing production and continuity, and ultimately executing the vision of the visual effects supervisor and film directors&amp;quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demo Reels, Credit Lists, can be found at his site at &lt;a href="http://jacobsworks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://jacobsworks.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to be able to reserve your own ticket&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a member of The Museum of Science! &lt;a href="https://store.mos.org/index.php?action=memb_buy;c=1" target="_blank"&gt;https://store.mos.org...&lt;/a&gt; For $75.00 you and a friend or loved one, with a Basic 2 membership, can visit the museum an unlimited amount of times and their everchanging list of special exhibits.
