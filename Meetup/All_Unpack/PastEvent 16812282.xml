&lt;p&gt;This Thursday's Practice Session will move to this Park on June
16th.&lt;/p&gt;

that regularly attend The Den practice sessions only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue is outdoors, open gazebo with covered top. Dress
appropriately for weather conditions, it will occur rain or shine.
Wear your Steppers of Boston shirts and gear. The dance floor is
polished stone, comfy shoes are a must. Bring your lawn chair and
snacks if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may draw a few spectators, of those folks that just happen to
be walking by at the time. Membership to our club has it's
privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Please RSVP... we need an accurate headcount. PLEASE BRING
  THE LARGEST/BRIGHTEST FLASHLIGHT YOU HAVE WITH FRESH BATTERIES.
  THE SUN MAY SET BEFORE WE ARE DONE. THIS WILL BE A BLAST STEPPIN'
  WITH A BUNCH OF FLASH LIGHTS AIMED AT THE FLOOR.
