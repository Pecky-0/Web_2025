I definitely want to do it next weekend. Get a extra pair of cloths as we will surly get wet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I am posting locations as One main st. near MIT T stop, but I might change it to place near Harvard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who want to do just kayaking/cannon can join me. It is definitely going to be fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, don't get scared because you don't know swimming. Even I don't know swimming, you will wear life west and easily get on surf board if you have confidence. This will be my fist time too and I am excited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;check this video for SUP instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-7rDavdJGs" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw : Charles Cannon and Kayaking has free parking. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karan</member_name><member_id>8985082</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278785965000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276990076000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>stand up paddle surfing</name><id>13851373</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278774000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/13851373/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
