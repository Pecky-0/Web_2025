I'll bring a MAC LAPTOP AND PLUGIN projector, please write in if you'd like to bring some pics of China to show the group. Put it on the message board or &amp;quot;contact me&amp;quot; through the website.&lt;br /&gt;SINCE YOU ASKED: photo limit- please choose your 10 best pics and have something to say about them in MAndarin, no matter how simple! Feel free to rbing all the rest of your photos, plan for 5-10 minutes each person, if we have more time we can add some, or do this again with another set of pics.&lt;br /&gt;-If several people have photo albums, let's break into smaller groups and rotate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-NEW ACTIVITY: Anyone want to make a holiday greeting card for the adults in our sister group in Shanghai, the English Cub at the Shanghai Y? I'll bring paper and pens. Maybe Edwin will take them for us  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INFO will be available on the new Saturday beginner intensive Mandarin course which starts in January at our host site BCNC. Since it's a new program, let's help spread the word to anyone looking to start Mandarin studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I'm selling things to benefit exchange with the Shanghai Y- apologies if this is not appropriate to mention here. I'll bring some in case anyone is interested in learning about it, fair trade organic coffee and souvenirs from China. All proceeds are being donated through the World Service YMCA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mandarin Conversation group Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;Monthly meeting to practice Mandarin conversation.
