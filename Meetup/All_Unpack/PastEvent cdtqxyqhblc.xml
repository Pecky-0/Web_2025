&lt;p&gt;I'll have snacks to share. If you're able I encourage you to bring something for yourself and or the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're welcome to join us for another Portuguese Table, which will be a fun easy going get together. No pressure to speak completely in Portuguese. You can become comfortable by just listening then jump in when you're ready to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet until at least 7 PM....maybe longer if the conversation is flowing....so get there when you can, just please RSVP and let us know when you will arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime ago in separate conversations Ramzi and Alvaro suggested we have simple lessons during our Portuguese Table. If there is an interest, we could play a game which can also serve as an ice breaker. Each person has five cards and the object of the game is to be the person with the most cards after five statements have been made, in Portuguese of course. The statement is "I have never...." and then you complete the sentence. For example, "I have never learned how to fly a plane." or  "Nunca aprendi como voar um avião." Then those who know how to fly a plane would put a card in the middle of the table. Then the next person will say "I have never...." and so on and so on. Another option suggested by Lucy is to read Brazilian magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not required to take part in the group conversations. It is okay to have individual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
