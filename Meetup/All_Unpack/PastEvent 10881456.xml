<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A bumbling British government minister (Tom Hollander) makes a verbal snafu during a TV interview, setting in motion this smart comedy and Sundance Film Festival hit that's already drawing comparisons to some of the great political and absurdist comedies, including Dr. Strangelove, Wag the Dog, Thank You for Smoking and Monty Python. With razor-sharp, truly laugh-out-loud dialogue, the film pokes fun at the absurdity and ineptitude of our highest leaders. With everyone looking out for number one, and the fate of the free world at stake (but apparently incidental), the hilarious ensemble cast of characters bumbles its way through Machiavellian political dealings, across continents, and toward comic resolutions that are unforeseeable. From the acclaimed team who created the award-winning BBC comedy series "Alan Partridge" and "The Thick of It." Also starring Peter Capaldi, Gina McKee and James Gandolfini.
