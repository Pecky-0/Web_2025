&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the director of Chocolat and the Oscar-winning&amp;reg; screenwriter of Slumdog Millionaire comes the inspirational comedy Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. When Britain's leading fisheries expert (Ewan McGregor) is approached by a consultant (Emily Blunt) to help realize a sheikh's (Amr Waked) vision of bringing the sport of fly-fishing to the desert, he immediately thinks the project is both absurd and unachievable. But when the Prime Minister's overzealous press secretary (Kristin Scott Thomas) latches on to it as a "good will" story, this unlikely team will put it all on the line and embark on an upstream journey of faith and fish to prove the impossible, possible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;112 Minutes long.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Director:&amp;nbsp; &lt;span&gt;Lasse Hallstr&amp;ouml;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
