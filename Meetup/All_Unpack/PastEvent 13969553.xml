Come and enjoy the fun! We will do a 20 mile ride starting at my house in Chatham. I am located 2 tenths of a mile from the Old Colony Trail in Chatham. Once on the trail it's a 5 mile ride to where the Old Colony Trail joins the Rail Trail in Harwich. We will ride and additional 5 miles on the Rail Trail before turning around. After riding the 10 miles back we will have a cookout here. I'll provide the main course and we will do pot luck on the sides and deserts. I'll have plenty of bottled waters on hand if you'd like to drink something else please bring it. We will gather at 8:45a and the ride starts at 9:00a. The location is listed here as the Old Colony Trail as I don't want my residential address posted. Riders will be sent directions and my address on request.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>DougP</member_name><member_id>10865421</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284079165000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277981291000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>20 mile challenge</name><id>13969553</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283000400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/13969553/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
