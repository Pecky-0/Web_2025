&lt;p&gt;From the Johnny D's website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 15 years Beatlejuice has been the #1 choice for Beatles fans looking to get their fix of the Fab 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faithfully reproducing some of the greatest songs ever written, Beatlejuice covers every era of the Beatles catalog and on to the solo careers of the boys from Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note - you don't have to like the Beatles (or even know who they are) but you must like to dance as fitness is part of the requirement for being a member of our group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No excuse if you don't have a car as Johnny D's is in Davis Sq. and right next to the T.&amp;nbsp; and no excuses if you don't know other people in the group as everyone dances with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
