&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ffff00"&gt;Timmy Maia and his band are playing at Hot Tomato's Friday, April 26th.  Hi sounds are reminiscent of the likes of Stevie Wonder, Nat King Cole, Michael Jackson, Brian McKnight, and&lt;/span&gt; Contemporary R&amp;amp;B love songs from the heart, a colossal of rhythms made to move the body, and relax the mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ffff00"&gt;"Timmy grew up in Waterbury, CT singing since he was a toddler. As a teenager he began honing his skills as a member of a Gospel Quartet and in various local clubs. He has subsequently been a staff singer for Sony Records, has had an original composition on "90210" as well as a music video on BET T.V. Timmy's vast studio experience has found him in recording studios all over the country. He is currently completing his second CD of original music. Although he loves the studio process, Timmy thrives on live performance and the energy of a live audience. Besides local venues, he has opened for the likes of Freddie Jackson, Phyllis Hyman and Brian McKnight, just to name a few. Timmy and (Bock &amp;amp; Blu keyboardist) Jay Rowe have been working together on various projects since 1998."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
