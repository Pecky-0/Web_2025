This place is getting rave reviews!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This restaurant offers Japanese cuisine and an assortment of Shushi combinations.  They cook your custom ordered dishes right in front of you at their Hibachi grills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need an EXACT count of who plans to attend- even if that means changing your rsvp the same day of the event.  I am planning a reservation at one of the Grill tables (where all the action takes place) and I need exact numbers.  If you rsvp that you plan to attend and do not show (without changing your rsvp), I am afraid that I will have to remove you from the group.  I hate to do this but there have been far too many events where people do not update if they cannot show and I wind up scrambling to get things in order while at the venue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that many new faces can show as this restaurant seems like a great place to hold a Meet Up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the date nears I will send out exact plans on where to meet/time etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and Happy Holidays Ladies!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lisa</member_name><member_id>2136226</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295418569000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fabulous Females</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Fabulous-Females-on-the-South-Shore</urlname><id>1511961</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>South Shores' Fabulous Females Unite!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292858696000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sake Steak House!
