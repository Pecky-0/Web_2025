With nearly 12k taking part you will see everyone from the hardline competitor to those wearing a wedding dress at the event. It is now a 2 day event taking place on the 22nd and 23rd, and I signed up for the 3 p.m. slot on the 22nd. The event for the 22nd is now full.The Warrior Dash is a 5k race with 12 very doable obstacles, but that Warrior wall is still 15ft high!When you click on the below link you can find a video that can let you know what it is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        I am organizing this event along with the Providence Collective, which is a group that some of you might already be members of.We do have a small group of people that have signed up with that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        For more information, including registration for  the event go to &lt;a href="http://www.warriordash.com"&gt;www.warriordash.com&lt;/a&gt;, then click on locations. I will post more details on this event as it gets closer.&lt;/p&gt;
