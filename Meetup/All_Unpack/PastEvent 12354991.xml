I watched this movie for the first time with a friend at the center about 2-3 years ago. It was emotional, it was enlightening and most of all,... it is so very believable. I could feel what he was going through and wanted to participate in seeing him successful. &lt;br /&gt;So my question to you is, have you even been down on your luck? Lost a job, can't fix you car, don't have they money to buy groceries or anything like that. This movie is real. It makes you think. It makes you want to be a better person. I promise you. If you are ready for a change but you just can't put your finger on it, or know your being called to do something great but can't define it yet.... then come, watch the movie and be part of a life changing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open at 6:30&lt;br /&gt;Movie starts at 7:00 sharp&lt;br /&gt;beverages and snacks will be available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to sharing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Barb&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266090993000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263848753000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conversations with God, Movie and Discussion night</name><id>12354991</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265414400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/12354991/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/4/global_9559044.jpeg</photo_url></item>
