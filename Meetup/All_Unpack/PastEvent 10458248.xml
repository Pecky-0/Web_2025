<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will revisit the results of our arbitrarily chosen stock trade (ALB - Albemarle Corp.) from April, and then select another stock using the CAN SLIM method this month, so be sure to check the various ratings etc. in IBD in preparation for your suggestions for a potential trade candidate. Remember... selection needs to be based on IBD/CAN SLIM for this trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so  if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a lively meeting!
