You can meet us directly at Foxwoods, or for those who would like to carpool, meet at the commuter parking lot at Exit 16 from Route 2 in Colchester.  Be there between 7:00 and 7:15 as the carpool will leave promptly at 7:15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll buy our bingo cards -- $25 for 20 games -- and reserve our places.  Then we'll head to the buffet breakfast for $10 as the bingo does not actually start until 10:30.  Expect to be there until mid-afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Don and Sharon are our hosts and even have extra daubers!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227391331000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223167956000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BINGO!</name><id>8898289</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226840400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/8898289/</event_url></item>
