Come join us for an evening out.  Please keep in mind when RSVPing that reservations will be made.  Please try to be on-time as they do not seat us until everyone has arrived. If your plans change please update your RSVP as soon as you know.  I will send my cell # to &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; RSVP's so that you can let me know of any last minute cancellations or if you have difficulty finding us.  Please do not call me for directions as I do not know the local roads.  For directions please call the restaurant&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby by the hostess desk.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242775322000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236944692000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group April Meetup</name><id>9945873</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240527600000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/9945873/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/3/e/global_7654414.jpeg</photo_url></item>
