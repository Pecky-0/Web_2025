Loved ones and spirits from the otherworld whisper to us in dreams and visions.  What lurks in the darkness...do you know?  What aspect of your passionate, sensual Self tickles at the ends of your conscious mind asking for expression?  Who is that goddess that asks to be loved, nurtured and birthed into manifestation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to this new moon circle and rediscover who you really are.  Take part in the ancient new moon rites established by our tribal matriarchs since pre-historic times, where women would retreat from the outside world and commune together, bleed together, confide in one another, weave their sultry magics and set their intentions for their community and themselves.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information and to confirm your attendance, please contact Volga Bo Olam at vvolga@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessed be!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289482644000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Goddess</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>goddess-327</urlname><id>1289522</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Goddess Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288465731000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sensual New Moon  in Scorpio: Goddess Circle</name><id>15280463</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288999800000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/goddess-327/events/15280463/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/9/global_9457785.jpeg</photo_url></item>
