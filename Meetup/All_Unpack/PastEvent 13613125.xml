We would be among other meetup group members also!  This is copied from the Cards &amp;amp; Conversation meetup:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Summertime! Come and join us for a day of outside fun at Kimball Farm in Westford. Easy to find off of Rt 495, Kimball offers  something for everyone of all ages.  If you like mini-golf, you will have a hard time choosing between the 2 courses! The Bumper Boats?
