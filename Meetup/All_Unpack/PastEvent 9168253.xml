Please let me know if it was yours, we have it at the reception desk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last meetup went really well, we had a great turnout with some very friendly &amp;amp; happy pups.  We were very lucky to have such a nice day, but I don't think we'll be so lucky next month.  The meetup is Dec 13th, which means we'll probably be in the upstairs room, but we have better access to the agility equipment, which is a lot of fun!  As usual, invite any dog-friendly pals that you may have &amp;amp; we hope to see all of you next month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the girls at the reception desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229365098000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226774477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another fun active dog meetup in Boxford</name><id>9168253</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229191200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/9168253/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/1/global_5883377.jpeg</photo_url></item>
