 &lt;br /&gt;

It doesn't matter how you got here, how long you've been here, or what you &lt;br /&gt;

did before you wound up here. All that matters now is that you're a slave &lt;br /&gt;

in the mines of the lich Drazhu. You toil in the dark to expand Drazhu's &lt;br /&gt;

underground lair, under the watchful eye of a goblin slavemaster and the &lt;br /&gt;

lich's orc mercenaries. Life is brutal and short now, and those who are too &lt;br /&gt;

weak to serve are killed and thrown into the body pit. There is no hope of &lt;br /&gt;

escape. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

At least, not until an earthquake suddenly strikes. Now the walls are &lt;br /&gt;

cracking, stones are dropping from the ceiling, and your goblin watchdog is &lt;br /&gt;

panicing. There's a few mining tools within reach, and it doesn't look like &lt;br /&gt;

the orcs in the next section over know what's going on yet. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

What do you do? &lt;br /&gt;

---- &lt;br /&gt;

Dungeon World is a fantasy RPG based on the Apocalypse World engine, and &lt;br /&gt;

this is a short demo to show off the system. Characters will be provided, &lt;br /&gt;

and the game will be self-contained and take around 2 hours. You won't need &lt;br /&gt;

any special dice or anything; the standard set will do. Onlookers welcome! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

*Players*: 6 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

*Time:* Wednesday Sept. 12, 6:15 pm. Will run for about 2 and a half hours&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sean Dunstan</member_name><member_id>12918559</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347501862000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346979623000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Slave-Pit of Drazhu</name><id>81233462</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347488100000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/81233462/</event_url></item>
