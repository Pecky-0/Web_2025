<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;It's summertime and you know what that means! &amp;nbsp;A barbecue with some outdoor games (or indoor games :-( ). &amp;nbsp;So how about a pre-Fourth of July barbecue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have be having a family-like barbecue (without all the dysfunction and drama of a real family) with a beautiful lawn that should allow us to play various games at once as well as relax. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, we will be playing outdoor games so if you like bocce, badminton, horseshoes, frisbee, tossing balls, sunning yourself or showing off yo-yo skills, please come and join us! &amp;nbsp;If the weather decides to become very wet, we will be doing traditional board and card games indoors. &amp;nbsp;The forecast says there is a 50/50 chance of sun or rain so we won't know what we are playing until the last minute. &amp;nbsp;But that just adds a little excitement to life, doesn't it? :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and this will be a joint meetup with the Boston C&amp;amp;C crew. &amp;nbsp;So come meet old friends and new! &amp;nbsp;;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to attend this event, all I ask is that you follow this simple process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Please bring a dish to share and mention that in your RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Please take a look at what others have already posted, so we don't end up all eating the same thing. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will take care of the rest. &amp;nbsp;I will supply a small amount of burgers, hot dogs and veggie burgers as well as drinks and plates. &amp;nbsp;But the rest of the food is up to you guys. &amp;nbsp;If there is something in particular you would like on the grill, please feel free to bring. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing, while we have a few outdoor games, we don't have everything (I actually don't have a badminton set, lol) &amp;nbsp;So if you want to play badminton or something else in particular, feel free to bring it. &amp;nbsp;Thanks! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
