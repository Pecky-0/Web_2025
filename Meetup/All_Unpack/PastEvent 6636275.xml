This will be &amp;quot;The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching - Transforming Suffering into Peace, Joy, and Liberation&amp;quot; by Thich Nhat Hanh, c. 1998, published by Broadway Books and available in paperback. In this book Thich Nhat Hanh introduces the core teachings of Buddhism and shows that the Buddha's teachings are accessible and applicable to our daily lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please note that our group is taking a new and exciting approach to determining the discussion agenda from month to month. To allow the participants to enjoy reading the books, to get the most out of their readings, and to have ample time to delve into the themes of the books, we will decide on the next month's topic at the end of each meeting. This may mean that the book being discussed will be carried over into the next month if there is general agreement that we want to continue a good discussion. Or, we may chose a new book...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, please consider attending this meeting, whether you have had a chance to read the entire book or not. You will always be welcome!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a sign on the table that says "Book Discussion."</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aurore Eaton</member_name><member_id>3983123</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1201255949000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People interested in Buddhism</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha</urlname><id>447070</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Manchester Buddhism Sangha</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193657286000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Buddhism Sangha book discussion</name><id>6636275</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200355200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha/events/6636275/</event_url></item>
