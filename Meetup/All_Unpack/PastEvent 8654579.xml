It was an awesome and not too hard of a hike. I think a perfect Sunday morning hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack, Bella and I would like to do it again and we welcome anyone to join us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parking area is a little hard to find so follow the directions carefully. Bring bug spray, water, a snack, and poop bags. Hope to see you there.

Esther Drive will be about 500' after on the left and the next left after that is the entrance to the parking area. The sign is made of wood and surrounded with green growth? easy to miss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pass the Town Marker of New Bedford? you've gone too far!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tan Chevy Tracker.
