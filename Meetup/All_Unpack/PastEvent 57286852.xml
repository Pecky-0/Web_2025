GRANDKIDS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this showing&amp;nbsp;is a matinee at 4:10 in the NASHUA Chunky's theater (Broad St off rte. 3, next street over from the Haluwa, in back of Home Depot).&amp;nbsp; If you are not familiar with Chunky's I can tell you it's a great place to eat and watch a movie, in nice big comfy leather chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided to take my grandchildren Mason 9 and Alyssa 4 to see this as it looks like it's the last day for the 3D version, and there are no showings of it in 3D in Pelham.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, it does cost $3 more for 3D, so it makes the matinee price of $5.25 actually $8.25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a couple "combo" packs and can offer&amp;nbsp;an admission, and a&amp;nbsp;popcorn &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; sundae to anyone at 3:10 before we go in, for $7.00 (you can text me at 603-235-9373 when you get there, before buying a ticket&amp;nbsp;if you're late, but NOT after the movie starts).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Even&amp;nbsp;if you buy&amp;nbsp;the pass with me, you will still be responsible to pay the extra $3 per ticket for the "3D" factor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here&amp;nbsp;are the regular prices...the matinee ticket $5.25 ($3&amp;nbsp;more for 3D), sundae $4,99 (it's big) and popcorn $4.25 (yes,&amp;nbsp;popcorn is&amp;nbsp;a little pricey).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; BTW, if you don't want 3D, you'll have to go to a showing of your own...lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't pay for Alyssa last time because I think it was 4 and under are free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to go in early and get good seats, and order drinks or food from their menu (check it out online at chunkys.com if you wish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;text me if you have any questions...or if you can't find me when you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
