I hope it works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you don't know, the &lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard Film Archives&lt;/a&gt; is a branch of the Harvard Film School. The movies are very, very eclectic.  It’s best going in with an open mind. Most the time I’m pleasantly surprised by what I see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theater is in the basement of the Carpenter Center, 24 Quincy Street. This is Harvard Sq so I encourage you to take public transportation as public parking is tough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll be going in to take a seat about 6:45 ish.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we can head over to any number of the places around the square for drinks, coffee, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man Who Fell to Earth&lt;br /&gt;Tickets: $9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Nicholas Roeg.&lt;br /&gt;With David Bowie, Candy Clark, Rip Torn&lt;br /&gt;UK 1976, 35mm, color, 139 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Bowie stars in Nicholas Roeg’s melancholy fable of a shipwrecked alien who disguises himself as a human in order to find his way home to his wife and family. Adrift and lost on Earth, the lonely space traveler has little to protect him from the forces of capitalist materialism, the banality of a televisual society and panoptic government authority.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I’ll be in the basement, to the right of the ticket both, wearing a crimson colored Harvard baseball cap with a round “MeetUp” sticker on the brim. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>ShaneO</member_name><member_id>8134848</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293825625000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276383208000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Man Who Fell to Earth @ Harvard Film Archives</name><id>13782220</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276987500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/13782220/</event_url></item>
