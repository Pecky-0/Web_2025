They have over 40 different varieties of seasonal ales from all over New England on tap. In addition they will have the regular CBC favorites available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The admission of $10 will get you a beer glass and some tickets for tasting. They also have food for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet inside at about 1pm. For more information check&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: This is a very popular event. Lines to get in usually go down the street for hundreds of yards. I plan on getting there by 12:30pm so I can get in by 1pm. It's okay if you are late because I'll be looking out for people and the event goes on through out the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll find a spot to hang out as our base camp. People can come and go as they find beers to taste. It's always fun comparing the different beers and telling people what you find tasty and not so tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that many people wear costumes. I'm not sure if I'll be wearing one yet but feel free to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for me in the outdoor tent area around 1pm. I'll wear a yellow Wyoming baseball cap which has a cowboy/horse logo on it.&lt;/strong&gt; I'll also post a number to text me at the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet inside ...
