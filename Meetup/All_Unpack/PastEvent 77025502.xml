&lt;p&gt;Join us for a leisurely night paddle on scenic Swains Lake, to paddle at night, you are required by New Hampshire Law to have a White "All Around" light. (A White Chemical Light Stick, mounted on your hat, should work as an "All Around" light if you don't have one.) In addition, we want you to have 2 Chemical Light Sticks,(one on your bow and one on you, to aid in rescue if required) and a flashlight or headlamp. The light sticks are available at Marine Stores and most "Dollar" Stores. (They are usually cheaper in "Dollar" Stores) When paddling at night, it is very important that we stay together... No Turtles or Hares!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swain's Lake in Barrington, New Hampshire is often referred to as Union Lake on maps and documents as the present body of water was once two smaller Ponds. The lake covers 400 acres, is three miles long, 1 mile wide at its widest point, and is approximately 25 feet deep. Swain's Lake is fed by a few small brooks most of the water consists of groundwater and collected rainfall from surrounding hills, as the lake is a natural watershed area. Swain's Lake drains into the Bellamy river, which in turn, feeds the Bellamy reservoir, a source of drinking Water for the City of Portsmouth, N. H. The original dam at Swains Lake was built in the early 1860's and enlarged in 1890 by the American Woolen Company. During the period of the mid to late 19th century textile mills were a booming industry in the State of New Hampshire. These mills used the abundant lakes, rivers and ponds in the state as an inexpensive source of power.&lt;/p&gt;
