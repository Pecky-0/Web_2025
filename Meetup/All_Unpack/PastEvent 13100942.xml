<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>i know many of us love trying foods from different cultures.  It is always exciting to travel around the world and taste how it is the food from that country is supposed to taste, not like what we get in a lot of the restaurants we visit that cater to the tastebuds of our area.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this meetup, I am opening our home to fellow food lovers who would like to share a food from their culture.  Be prepared to explain what it is you made and why you made it.  ;0)  Don't worry if you and your mate are of different cultures, pick one to share and maybe share the other one next time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't wait to see what foods from around the world we'll get to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please write what sort of dish you will be bringing (appetizer, main, dessert) when you RSVP.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue house on the corner.
