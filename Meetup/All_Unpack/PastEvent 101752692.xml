&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rescheduling this event for March 3. Hope to see you then! Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go hiking or snow shoeing on the Peabody Mill Environmental Trail in Amherst NH. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I plan on hiking for approximately two hours, while taking many small breaks along the way. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will meet at 2:00pm sharp, at the Brook Rd, entrance. Please follow these directions: From the Nashua area, take Route 101 to Horace Greeley Rd, cross small stream, turn left onto Brook Rd. Go all the way to the end (2 ½ mi), pavement turns to dirt for the last ¾ miles. Look for a white Toyota or a Meetup sign. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers for comfort. &lt;br /&gt;

 This event is at no cost! I hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;

 Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897 Do not RSVP no. &lt;br /&gt;
