This party is a blast. Great food, a great speaker and good times. The room only holds 40 or so and the RSVP's are coming in fast. RSVP soon to assure your place at the table!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guest Speaker DCR Fire Patrolman Mike Marquardt will talk about becoming Fire Wise. We'll celebrate DCR Staff and Friends of MSSF 2010 Accomplishments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appetizers from 5:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;Dinner at 6:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Greg White's Famous Clam Chowder! Vegetarian or meat lasagna main course will be provided. (Unfortunately, Jim Nelson can't make the party and unless someone else has MSSF Venison, we may miss this special dish from the menu this year. We'll keep you posted.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last names A thru N bring beverages (non alcoholic) or appetizers; last names O thru Z bring salad or dessert. Think green. Bring your own tableware. Children are welcome. The party is accessible. Space is limited to the first 40 who RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The party is in the Conference Building, across the street from the MSSF Headquarters. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295817149000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295013685000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friends of MSSF 2nd Annual Potluck Supper Party</name><id>16046699</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295733600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/16046699/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/c/global_13075244.jpeg</photo_url></item>
