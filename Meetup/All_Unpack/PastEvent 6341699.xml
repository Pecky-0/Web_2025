She wrote a book about her life and personal spiritual journey. It is called Giving Birth to God: a woman's path to enlightenment. She was a home birth midwife for 17 years and a mother of 4 children.  Currently, she lives in Colorado and travels throughout the country giving lectures and classes about peace and having a one on one connection to your inner Self.  She only comes to Boston 3 times a year so you don't want to miss it. The fee is to cover her airfare.  Please join me at this special event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spiritual Growth and Development: Elements, attitudes and practices that ensure spiritual growth, and how to incorporate them into a busy life &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of us want to grow spiritually, and may have adopted some spiritual beliefs and practices. But does it still feel like something is missing, something that should help us grow more quickly and profoundly? And can these be included in an already busy life?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542141000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189567903000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar: Spiritual Growth and Development</name><id>6341699</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189724400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/6341699/</event_url></item>
