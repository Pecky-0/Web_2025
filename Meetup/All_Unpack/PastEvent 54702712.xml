We're going to keep the meeting point at Ocean State Job &amp;amp; can drive down from there. Intersection 44 and 167 might also be ideal, we could do that after 177. If you're coming down a little later and are trying to find us give 860-730-3RON a ring and we will get you to our current location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have re-scheduled Saturday's sign wave due to the forecast of rain (now at 80% chance). The new location is in Canton at the intersection of Rt. 44 and Rt. 179 from Noon until 4pm on Sunday. There is an Ocean State Job Lot nearby we can meet and park at. Bring your signs, energy and enthusiasm!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sara Lynn</member_name><member_id>29188532</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330885410000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330720186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign Wave at the Intersection of Rt. 44 and Rt. 179</name><id>54702712</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330880400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/54702712/</event_url></item>
