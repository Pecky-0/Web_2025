This class is designed to offer a quiet reprieve to those seeking to deeply connect. The added benefit is that beginners will learn how to develop their own rituals, or spontaneously call on these relaxation techniques, when necessary, in other scenarios.  Ultimately, participants begin to &amp;quot;respond&amp;quot; to situations in daily life, rather than &amp;quot;react&amp;quot;. Many women have found this class to have positive effects on their parenting, their jobs, marriages, and relationships in general. We welcome you to embarque with us on this journey to an improved state of  &amp;quot;well-being.&amp;quot; You can read what others have said about this class by clicking &amp;quot;What member's are saying&amp;quot; on our home page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no charge for this class, but donations are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>7932349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239849299000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237038997000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sally's Meditation Class</name><id>9952063</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239663600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/9952063/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/f/c/global_7505116.jpeg</photo_url></item>
