Nothing like a tear-jerker drama to pick up our spirits on a holiday weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plot (from imdb.com): Anna Fitzgerald (Abigail Breslin) looks to earn medical emancipation from her parents (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric) who until now have relied on their youngest child to help their leukemia-stricken daughter Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) remain alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is playing at Blackstone Valley at 4:45 PM on Sunday, July 5. Let's plan on meeting at about 4:25. Afterwards, anyone who wants to can go out for dinner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the guy with glasses, goatee, and Superman cap</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248642068000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246214739000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>My Sister's Keeper - Meet at 4:25 at Blackstone Valley</name><id>10753762</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246825800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/10753762/</event_url></item>
