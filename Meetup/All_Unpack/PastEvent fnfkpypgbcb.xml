I'll update each one as it gets closer with a place and a host.  Stop by, for a few minutes, or all night.  Its a great time to come meet new folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out their incredible, extensive list of martinis here: &lt;a href="http://www.venetianmoon.com/menu/drink-menu/" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.venetianmoon.com/menu/drink-menu/&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp; They also have delicious tapas! &amp;nbsp; Each person is responsible for their own food/drink purchases.&amp;nbsp; It's best if you bring cash but you can also run a credit card tab.&amp;nbsp; Please be courteous to our server and tip well - they do a LOT of running around with 20+ members of our group all ordering things throughout the evening!&lt;/p&gt;
