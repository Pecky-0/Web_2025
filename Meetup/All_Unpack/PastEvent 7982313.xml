After the game, we'll hang out for a bit on the field or head into Davis for some snacks.   It looks like it FINALLY won't be raining this Friday, so bring an extra sweatshirt or something so you aren't cold if we do stay on the field.  Before attending our events, please review our About Us page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd recommend you bring a light-colored shirt for visibility's sake and a change of clothes. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, lanyards, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Please consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our Amazon Wishlist to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your optional donations are certainly appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're the loud, fun, crazy group in the football stadium throwing around light-up Frisbees.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mat</member_name><member_id>3297748</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelli</member_name><member_id>4908325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211760301000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><why>We've been playing Ultimate at night for a full year now!
