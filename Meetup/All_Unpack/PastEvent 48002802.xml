The Opening Reception is scheduled for this day noon-4 p.m. The Exhibit will run through February 11, 2012 (Sat&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; Sun&amp;rsquo;s only 12-4 p.m.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine Art Photographers from around the state have combined their styles&amp;nbsp;and techniques to create a unique representation of old as well as new methods in the field.&amp;nbsp; Black and white silver gelatin prints, conventional color prints, pinhole photography,&amp;nbsp; historically inspired hand-made contact prints, as well as &amp;ldquo;state of the art&amp;rdquo; digital images printed on archival papers are among the photographic styles traditionally exhibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Gallery Talks by NHSPA members are scheduled. Details are available at &lt;a href="http://www.nhspa.org/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.nhspa.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHSPA supports contemporary photography as a means for creative expression and cultural insight.&amp;nbsp; NHSPA focuses on the education and artistic development of its members and the community by providing exhibitions, publications, education, and outreach programs.&lt;/p&gt;
