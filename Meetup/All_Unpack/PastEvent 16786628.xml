A veterinary student  who almost earned his degree, Jacob is put in charge of caring for the  circus menagerie. It is there that he meets Marlena, the beautiful young  star of the equestrian act, who is married to August, the charismatic  but twisted animal trainer. He also meets Rosie, an elephant who seems  untrainable until he discovers a way to reach her. Water for Elephants  is illuminated by a wonderful sense of time and place. It tells a story  of a love between two people that overcomes incredible odds in a world  in which even love is a luxury that few can afford.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abdul</member_name><member_id>2464273</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1305388215000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299186406000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Time: Water for Elephants</name><id>16786628</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1305326700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/16786628/</event_url></item>
