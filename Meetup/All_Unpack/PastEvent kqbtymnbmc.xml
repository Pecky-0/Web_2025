So from 7:30 to 8:00 will be open and social! Hanging out chit chatting will be encouraged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The from 8:00 to 9:00 we will have a more organized agenda. A topic, a presentation, a group sharing of images, something related to Photography!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then from 9 to 9:30 We will hang out again catching up with folks from that evenings topic. We'll clean up and head out by 9:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky or ridged just a but more &amp;quot;photo related&amp;quot; verses &amp;quot;social party&amp;quot; ... folks have told me they come here to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this months discussion topic is PhotoShop! I know all you tech savvy guys want to share! We'll have a computer attached to the projector and a few sample images up so if anyone has a specific question about how to do something in PH we can do a quick down and dirty demo. So come prepared to ask your questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going forward we will be asking for a donation at the meetups of $5.00 to cover costs.
