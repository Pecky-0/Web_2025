Join us for dinner @ 7 pm reservations for some great Roast Beef or Fried Clams or any of the other pub theme items. I've reserved the function room that holds up to 75 people so come on out and enjoy a delicious dinner, lots of laughs and make new friends!  Enjoy the Black Angus Beef (steaks, burgers or meatloaf). Lots of items to choose from on the menu.  Location is right off route 495 in Franklin on 391 E. Central Street.  After dinner we can enjoy cocktails/drinks/beer in the spacious bar area and meet &amp;quot;Tom the Bartender whom I've heard is a complete 'riot'!!! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;This event is for 25 members whom reply with a confirmed YES!
