&lt;p&gt;I am not a professional but am willing to offer suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I would love to see folks who have camera ability come and share their knowledge.&amp;nbsp; I was hoping we could gather after the hike to share the images we took but the nature center will not be open that day.&amp;nbsp; Maybe we can solve that when we meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail is groomed and easy to walk on.&amp;nbsp; Sneakers are appropriate as we are not going to encounter any great challenges.&amp;nbsp; I would bring a small pack with water and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a holiday weekend but some of&amp;nbsp;us will have no events.&amp;nbsp; If you like this idea but cannot attend, let me know so I can plan future trips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with me, NO DOGS NO KIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the link to the park information with the trail map.&lt;/p&gt;
