Once on Storrow Drive, go about 2-3 miles and take the first _right_ exit, for River St/Cambridge. At the top of the ramp, take a right and go over the Charles River. On the far side, turn right again onto Memorial Drive, and the Courtyard Marriott is 100yds up on the left. (Alternatively, cross over to Memorial Drive sooner and follow Memorial Drive up-river to the hotel which will be on the right.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Car via Mass Pike: Take exit 20 for Cambridge/Alston. Stay right after the tolls, and go down the off ramp. Continue straight through a massive intersection and across the Charles River. On the far side, turn right on to Memorial Drive, and the Courtyard Marriott is 100yds up on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free parking is available in the hotel garage, and also in the mall's parking lot adjacent to the hotel until 1:30.
