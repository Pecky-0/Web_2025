We will continue to hold these parties until all of the 2009 bills are reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based upon the experience from last year, these events will be limited in the number of participants therefore &lt;b&gt;please RSVP&lt;/b&gt;.  We will have other parties therefore if you cannot attend this one or if the RSVP limit is met, please check the calendar for the next event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is scheduled for three hours, therefore please bring your favorite drink, snacks and a copy of the New Hampshire Constitution, if you have one.  You do &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; need to bring a laptop to this event.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not been trained to do bill reviews, you are welcome to RSVP, however it is strongly encouraged that you attend a bill review training session (check our calendar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Anyone who fights for the Future lives in it today.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; - Ayn Rand&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233598720000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231701576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHLA Bill Review Party</name><id>9499252</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233424800000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/9499252/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_4426902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
