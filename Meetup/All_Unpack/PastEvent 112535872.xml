&lt;p&gt;This talk is part of the Cambridge Sci Fest, and takes place at the Armenian Musem and Library in Watertown Square. I know a lot of Armenians, and the history is amazing. From the site: "Illustrated lecture and panel discussion about ongoing discoveries made at the Shengavit archaeological site on the outskirts of Yerevan, Armenia, one of Cambridge's sister cities. The site contains artifacts and building structures from the Kura-Araxes culture which was widespread in the area from the mid - fourth millennium to the second millennium BCE. Vladimir Tshagharyan, Director of the Shengavit Historical and Archaeological Culture Preserve, will be joined by Prof. Mitchell Rothman of Widener University who is working on the site.Illustrated lecture and panel discussion about ongoing discoveries made at the Shengavit archaeological site on the outskirts of Yerevan, Armenia, one of Cambridge's sister cities.
