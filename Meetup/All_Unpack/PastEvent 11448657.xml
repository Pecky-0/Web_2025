<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I asked Bill Shakespeare for special permission to play freely with Hamlet's words and he readily gave me permission.  Yes, he spoke to me, he really did!  Well, the truth is that I think Hamlet's soliloquy is as much about freedom as it is about being. What is human existence without at least the sense of freedom?  And is not the choice of death, which &amp;quot;comes when it will come&amp;quot; (&lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/i&gt;) generally a result of a sense that all freedom of being--or  its conception--has expired?  This discussion will surely involve the perennial philosophical debate of freedom v. determinism, but it will also include some amplification of what it really means to be free.  Personally, I think that some very determined and necessary situations can amplify freedom!  On the other hand, there are some situations that while overflowing with choices are paralyzingly un-free because we are so &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; that the concept of freedom loses some meaning.  But I digress. I hope that the meeting is more directed than my blabber.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the guy in the picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260225788000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253732992000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>To be free or not to be free?
