<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>You are invited to join fellow members of the Manchester Buddhism Sangha for lunch at one of Manchester's favorite Chinese restaurants. This will be a chance to say &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; and get acquainted and network. The lunch will be &amp;quot;family style&amp;quot; (there are no lunch special plates on Sunday), and we'll split the bill at the end. We request that there be no alcoholic beverages ordered. Please bring cash for your payment (the price will be very reasonable). Vegetarian items will be available.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Venerable Thich Hai Thong of the Chua Phuoc Dien Temple in Manchester invites you to visit the temple prior to the lunch. The Vietnamese &amp;quot;zen&amp;quot; service at the temple, which is located at the 684 Auburn Street in Manchester, starts at 10 a.m. You can also join in an informal dharma talk and tour of the temple after the service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact Aurore Eaton, organizer, if you have any questions about the lunch or the temple.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the "Meetup" group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aurore Eaton</member_name><member_id>3983123</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232661394000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People interested in Buddhism</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha</urlname><id>447070</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Manchester Buddhism Sangha</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227269889000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Get-together lunch for the Manchester Buddhism Sangha</name><id>9206029</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229275800000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Buddhism-Sangha/events/9206029/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/5/global_1946069.jpeg</photo_url></item>
