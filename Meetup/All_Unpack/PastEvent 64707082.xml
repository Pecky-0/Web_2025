&lt;p&gt;Science in the News is an organization of Harvard graduate students dedicated to bringing cutting edge research to the public in a fun and informative format.  Their lectures are clear and well presented, and allow for lots of questions and interaction from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture is from 7:00 to 9:00 (or thereabouts).  We'll begin gathering in the hallway at the entrance to the lecture hall about a half hour beforehand, then go in and get seats about 10-15 minutes before it starts.  There are snacks and refreshments, and afterwards we'll head to Pizzeria Uno (or some such place) for food, drinks, and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group beforehand, just look for us outside the auditorium afterwards - we won't be too hard to find.  Just look for the two nerd herders wearing Meetup pins :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From SITN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last three billion years Earth's climate has nurtured life. However, records of Earth’s history indicate that climate has changed dramatically with major consequences for its inhabitants. How often has Earth's climate changed and at what rates? What drives such climate changes? What are the consequences? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Since the industrial revolution of the mid-19th century, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased several fold. This has resulted in perceptible warming of the atmosphere and oceans and has caused changes in weather patterns. Find out about a novel engineering approach to reducing CO2 emissions by turning them into a liquid and then pumping it underground. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

While they receive a significant amount of attention, greenhouse gases are not the only factor responsible for climate change. Find out how aerosols, particularly desert dust, affect rainfall, and consequently the availability of fresh water and food, in arid regions. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

All of this and much more at the SITN climate and weather lecture on the 30th of May!&lt;/p&gt;
