<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>After work moderate hike on Lookout and Case Mountains, 744 ft. and 735 ft. altitude respectively. Hike will be for 2 hours and exact route depends on conditions and a whim ;-), about 3 miles. Generally we'll take the white trail to the peak, yellow trail down to the blue trail (Shenipsit Trail) and take that south. We'll make a trip out to the pond too. The start of the hike from the parking lot is somewhat steep to the peak but after that it is much easier. We'll meet in the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Ed. P has offered a faster option on this hike for those interested. He has a 5 - 6 mile course that will be covered in the 1.5 to 2 hr. period. The rest of us will still do the original hike but again, those interested can chose the faster pace. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a quart of water and wear trail appropriate shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A map can be found as Map SH-8 in the &amp;quot;Connecticut Walk Book: East&amp;quot; 19th Ed., by the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approximate location/directions&lt;/b&gt; to parking and start: Spring St., Manchester, CT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;popflag=0&amp;amp;address=650+spring+st.&amp;amp;city=manchester&amp;amp;state=ct" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions from Hartford&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;* Take I-84 East to I-384&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 4 off of I-384 (Highland St.)&lt;br /&gt;* From the end of the Exit ramp, right onto Spring St.&lt;br /&gt;* Go about 0.2 mile and make a sharp left and you'll see a small parking lot at the bottom of the hill on your left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
