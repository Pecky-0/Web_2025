<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's walk around Beacon Hill for a bit.  I'll put up a map of the proposed walk later, but wanted to get this meetup out there now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Charles/MGH station - inside at the bottom, outside the fare gates so people driving can gather.  I'll be taking the T.  It's the All-Star Break, so there is no game at Fenway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=42.361715,-71.066952&amp;amp;spn=0.014618,0.031285&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;msid=117398343489237033278.00046eb1b96bbf78841ae" target="_blank"&gt;Here is the proposed map.&lt;/a&gt;  Who knew that Beacon Hill is barely 4 miles of road.  I thought it would be more.  Parts of it can be pretty steep, so if we don't get 4 miles of walking in, I'm sure we'll all get a good workout with the hills. :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See my pic, and I'll email my cell # to the RSVPs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doug</member_name><member_id>4908818</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247934008000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247366839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beacon Hill (4 miles)</name><id>10856252</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247698800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/10856252/</event_url></item>
