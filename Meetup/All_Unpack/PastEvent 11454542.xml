<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Williker's (also known as G Williker's) on route 20, near the route 9 intersection, is a &amp;quot;cabin&amp;quot; (so the sign says) that offers BBQ and spirits. The hub of G Williker's is the four-sided bar, a la Cheers, with 4 big screen plasma TVs around the bar. Off the main bar area is a room with a few pool tables, another room that's sort of a bar annex, and the main dining room. Williker's is a fun place to hang out, where everyone knows your name (and if they don't already, they try to). Your glass will never be empty before you are asked for a refill. They have decent crisp onion rings that were the puffy batter variety, served with a creamy/tangy dipping sauce. There are two kinds of ribs, babybacks and &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; ribs (St Louis), which comes with slaw, beans and cornbread. &lt;br /&gt;Let's check this out...........join us for a fun time!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257118834000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253786452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WILLIKER'S TEX MEX &amp; BBQ</name><id>11454542</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256945400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/11454542/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/2/a/global_10875882.jpeg</photo_url></item>
