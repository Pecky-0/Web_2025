Sort of.... I've asked the FCA students and pilots who are not members to join us on a fly out for breakfast. Here's the itinerary. Depart KFIT at 8:30 for KBAF. Pic up Bradley on 119.00 somewhere over Quabbin for radar services into KBAF. Eat, non PIC pay for the PIC. From KBAF, we need a squawk to depart and we head to KORH for a couple touch and go's. From there back to KFIT for some debriefing. 3 airports, into delta airspace, contacting a few different ATC facilities. Good stuff, let's work this with them. By flying students or pilots who don't fly often, we can show them the FPA way. Fly, eat and have fun. I'll put the choices down as questions and lets see how many we can get to go! We earned it, let's go flying, Charley&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at FCA by 8:00 a.m.  Sunday morning For wheels up at 8:30.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326177745000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325647739000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FPA Take A Student Flying Fly Out...</name><id>46560282</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326029400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/46560282/</event_url></item>
