&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Patrick's Pub, on Smith Street just over past the State House in the Smith Hill neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Patrick's Pub comes on good recommendation as "the most authentic Irish bar in Providence", and it would seem that that would hold true as they have also sponsored the Providence St. Patrick's Day Parade since 1992. The Collective has never been to Patrick's for an MNM, so here we go! The beer selection looks pretty good and if you want to try some authentic food, it looks like they've got it covered! It also seems that Mondays are Dart League nights, so there might be some sporting to watch as well. Sounds like a good time, so let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Christopher is hosting this one - please look at his picture!!!!"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher</member_name><member_id>10240270</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327445468000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>48</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323188714000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Meetup - Patrick's Pub!</name><id>43571962</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327359600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/43571962/</event_url></item>
