We will be ascending Jefferson first from randolph path and then hiking across the range to Adams and Madison.  We will descend valley way back to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance: approx. 15 miles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long hike and I am determined to get jefferson at the very least so please only sign up if you are in good shape and have proper gear.  This is the most exposed hike in the whites as it is hours spent above treeline with no shelter.  Furthermore the weather on jefferson is only slightly less horrific than washington and there is no quick escape if you get into trouble.  That being said I have done this hike solo and will not hesitate to turn back if we get into trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weather is dangerously bad we will go for a backup peak from my list.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be driving a silver mazda wagon.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266415786000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265468819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Northern Presidentials (Jefferson, Adams, and Madison)</name><id>12535238</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266242400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12535238/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/c/global_12960620.jpeg</photo_url></item>
