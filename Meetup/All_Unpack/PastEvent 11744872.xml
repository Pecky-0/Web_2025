Join us at the brand new Va Va Voom Dance Studio in Natick for some dancing, exercise and tons of laughs!! We have arranged a special class just for us at a great discount. We'll have a special one hour class that will include an introduction to Zumba and also an introduction to the Hip to Strip class. See the class descriptions below... I'm thinking we could be in for a lot of laughs and some exercise, too! The studio owner, Ann Saldi, has offered us a special rate for the night of just [&lt;u&gt;b]$8/person&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for our special class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Va Va Voom Dance Studio is located at 127 W.

Easy to follow moves create a dynamic dance fitness program. FUN, EASY and EFFECTIVE! Why do you need to try Zumba®? Because it's the best party in town!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIP TO STRIP™: This striptease-based dance is something every woman should try at least once. We take the basic moves of striptease and combine them with some dance elements to give you the sexiest routine around. BENEFITS from this workout: Confidence, Spice In Your Life and a Few Good Laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE:  We need to confirm the time.  It will most likely be 7:30pm.  Check back and watch future updates to be sure of the correct time.  We want to get the event and date communicated right away since it is only 2 weeks away! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanya</member_name><member_id>7153030</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262139240000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256853606000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Zumba &amp; Hip to Strip!</name><id>11744872</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258158600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/11744872/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/5/a/global_8459978.jpeg</photo_url></item>
