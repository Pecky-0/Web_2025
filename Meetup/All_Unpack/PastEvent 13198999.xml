There we'll leave a couple of cars, then drive over to where we'll begin our hike on Garfield Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details to follow....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But bare minimum is if you want to bag both Garfield and Lafayette it's a total of &lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;13.6 miles&lt;/span&gt;. I believe it is fair to say that this is &lt;b&gt;an advanced hike&lt;/b&gt;. Garfield Ridge Trail is described as &amp;quot;the footway is rough - more difficult than one might gather from a glance at the map&amp;quot; in the AMC book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've stayed many a night at Galehead hut and there isn't a day hiker from Greenleaf to Galehead who would not wholeheartedly agree with that statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>two-toned dark grey Subaru Outback, bike racks on roof</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michele</member_name><member_id>9237839</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277748702000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271417564000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Path less traveled - Lafayette &amp; Garfield via Skookumchuck </name><id>13198999</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277551800000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/13198999/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/2/global_14305586.jpeg</photo_url></item>
