&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Polish director Agnieszka Holland (Europa, Europa, The Secret Garden), making a film about the destruction of Lvov&amp;rsquo;s Jewish ghetto confronts the past of both her country and her own family: her Jewish father was killed in the Warsaw uprising, and her Catholic mother fought in the underground. In Darkness is based on the true story of a Polish petty thief and sanitation worker, and the disparate group of Jews hiding in the sewers who must rely on him for protection. &amp;ldquo;In a world where everyone was hoping to survive the nightmare and maybe even turn other people&amp;rsquo;s misery into a tidy profit, the fact that a fragile humanity survived at all is little short of a miracle.&amp;rdquo; - Kenneth Turan, LA Times. Academy Award Nomination for Best Foreign Film.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337568088000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333910826000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"In Darkness"</name><id>59738482</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337555700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/59738482/</event_url></item>
