Northern Extremes is a company in North Conway that will give you a tube and transportation to the Saco river. This section of the Saco features a couple of small rapids, beautiful sandy beaches, great fishing holes and rope swings. Trip ends at their private 10 acre beach where you can relax and picnic. Cost is 20 bucks. They do reservations for groups larger than 10 so I'll see how much interest we have and then call if we get more than 10. For those of you doing the Mt Washington hike this would be a great way to relax the next day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northernextremes.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.northernex...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some other similar companies that give discounts (down to 15 bucks is the lowest I've seen) for large groups. I'll look into those once we get a better idea of numbers.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the bright yellow escape or call my cell 508 414 8544.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1282399819000</updated><rating><average>3.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279157236000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tubing the Saco!</name><id>14106788</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281276000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/14106788/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/a/d/global_16433293.jpeg</photo_url></item>
