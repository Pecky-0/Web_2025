Two hikes in one! We'll have a one-mile walk around Risley Pond, and a longer loop (about three miles) over rough and very steep terrain, with a nice view from a high ridge -- you can see Bolton Notch.  Both hikes start at the same spot, and you can decide as we go along which loop you want to take. Heavy rain cancels, but if it's just sprinkling, we'll try the hike. No dogs, please. Meet at the Risley Pond parking lot on the north side of Lake Street, Vernon, across from Amy Drive. There's also parking along Amy Drive if the lot is full.  I'll have a blue backpack and a clipboard. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Holding a clipboard!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>41</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276369231000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270342768000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>June 6 Risley Park Walks</name><id>13079824</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275843600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/13079824/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/0/global_14114272.jpeg</photo_url></item>
