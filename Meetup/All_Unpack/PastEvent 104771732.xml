&lt;p&gt;For those that are off on President's day - Let's take the yearly trip to Dave and Busters in Providence. What's Dave and Buster's?,  well someone dubbed it the Chuck-e-Cheese for adults. There is a restaurant, arcade and bar. Let's meet at my place 163 S Main St Colchester and carpool on up.  I'm thinking meet me at 11 at my place - we can go up there, eat lunch there and hang out for a few hours play some games have some fun. or we can plan to meet there directly around noonish. The meals average about $10.00 - $15.00 and the game play is up to you. If you do not have a power card you get one for $1.00 and then charge it up however you want. You can use it later on another time that you go to any D&amp;amp;B nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to have some fun hanging out Monday playing House of the dead 4 and the pony races. :)&lt;/p&gt;
