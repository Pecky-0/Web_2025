As long as you have a love for Frenchies, anyone is welcome to attend and join in on the fun!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 People considering adding a Frenchie to their family should definitely stop by.Â  We're always willing to talk about how great our dogs are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and/or your Frenchie's picture are required for membership.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 Please NO breeder/breeding solicitations, regardless of membership.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

 Meetup fees and dues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetup.com charges $19/month to host individual groups on this site. The organizer is responsible for paying this fee every month. Additionally, some meetup venues charge $7-10 per Frenchie and/or a fee as much as $50 for venue use. At each meetup there we will try and have a donation box available for a suggested $3 donation that will go towards the monthly $19 fee. If at the end of the month, the organizer does not collect enough money through donations, the organizer will pay the difference. If the organizer receives more than enough, the extra money will be banked for use to cover shortages for future months and/or additional meetup expenses (i.e. if less than 7 Frenchies go to a Fenway Bark meetup the balance for the $50 meetup fee is due). At the end of the year if there are additional funds available a portion will be rolled over into the next year and a portion will be donated to a Frenchie in need at the &lt;a href="http://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/"&gt;French Bulldog Rescue Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.64</rating><join_mode>approval</join_mode><created>1131144203000</created><lat>42.3400001526</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>109</id><urlkey>dogrescue</urlkey><name>Dog Rescue</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1991</id><urlkey>bostonterrier</urlkey><name>Boston Terrier</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>2151</id><urlkey>frenchbulldog</urlkey><name>French Bulldog</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>7929</id><urlkey>smallbreeddogs</urlkey><name>Small Breed Dogs</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>9753</id><urlkey>offleash</urlkey><name>Off Leash Dog Recreation</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15052</id><urlkey>bully-breeds</urlkey><name>Bully Breeds</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>17407</id><urlkey>dog-parks</urlkey><name>Dog Parks</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>18240</id><urlkey>bulldog</urlkey><name>Bulldog</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>19163</id><urlkey>doggie-playgroups</urlkey><name>Doggie Playgroups</name></topics_item></topics><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name><id>213526</id><members>299</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>49571912</member_id><name>Zeek</name></organizer><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/5/600_15904533.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/5/highres_15904533.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>15904533</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/b/5/thumb_15904533.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/</link><lon>-71.0899963379</lon></item>
