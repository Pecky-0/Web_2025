The main feature of our gathering is a pre-recorded talk by Jack Kornfield, who has been teaching meditation and mindfulness since the mid-70's. In his talk about &amp;quot;Freedom&amp;quot;, Jack poignantly weaves in heart-opening stories and quotes as he talks about the path to true freedom of heart and mind. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world through mindfulness and meditation. We'd love to have you join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Please try to get there by 6:00pm as they have asked us to keep the door locked due to recent security issues. If you arrive after 6pm and there's no one at the door, please ring the night buzzer (it's right by the door and is labeled as there are two buzzers). We'll come down and get you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291075754000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290451757000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jack Kornfield: Freedom, Part II</name><id>jdptpynpbmc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291071600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/15527763/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
