I ( John Dumas) will not be there as I must baby sit that Monday night.  However Devon will host this meetup away from our usual place. I may change some of the details.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple different card games will be played.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you will all consider coming to play our very social version of Kitty Whist that has a great deal of randomness built into the game. Really if you have ever played a game where you must follow suit you know most of the game. After a few hands you will pick up the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no charge for this meetup, BUT, please buy something from the restaurant, so we can justify using their space.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge: bring someone new.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289271365000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287991878000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Card Night with Devon at the Gulu  Monday, 11-8-2010</name><id>15218515</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289259000000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/15218515/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/1/global_11205793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
