&lt;p&gt;Reserved seats are almost sold out (there are no large blocks left). &amp;nbsp;We'll be going in GA this time. &amp;nbsp;Get John $7 before 5/8 and he'll buy a block of tickets online. &amp;nbsp;As we will be going in to the GA seats this is not necessary, and you can just purchase your ticket at the game (assuming it doesn't sell out)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI - The game starts at 1:05, the early start time is for the Star Wars day and so you can get to the free parking near the stadium. &amp;nbsp;Also with GA seating, it's first come/first serve so we'll try to have a few folks go in and save us some seats/left field&amp;nbsp;berm&amp;nbsp;grass :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sunday Run the Bases&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each and every Sunday home game at McCoy Stadium during the 2011 season, you will have the opportunity to run the bases after the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Find John in his VA Tech Baseball Cap and Jersey outside by the ticket windows before the game.
