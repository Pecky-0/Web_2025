It looks like a silly comedy, so I'm tempted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the story: Four guys get in a hot tub in 2010 and find themselves transported back in time to 1986. Some of them get a chance to change their lives. One of them tried to make sure he gets born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7:30 PM at Blackstone Valley Cinema. So let's &lt;b&gt;meet in the lobby at 7:00&lt;/b&gt;. I'll wear my Superman cap so you can recognize me. If you need to reach me, my cell phone number is 508-981-0455.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, we have 1 Yes (me) and 1 Maybe. If we don't get another yes by Saturday afternoon, I'll cancel the meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants to join me for food/drinks after the movie is welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- David&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear my Superman cap.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270510672000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269698838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hot Tub Time Machine</name><id>13007057</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270337400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/13007057/</event_url></item>
