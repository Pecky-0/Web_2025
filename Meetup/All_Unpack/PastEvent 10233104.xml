All ability levels are welcome to participate.  This group is about meeting new people, staying active and enjoying some sunshine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday at 9 am is the time to meet.  If you're new, look for the group congregating at the center bleachers or look for a bandana tied to the fence of the section we're playing in.  Bring something to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the event that the courts are in use when we get there, plan to detour over to the Wolcott Park courts on New Britain Avenue, just a few blocks from Conard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Send me a note if you have questions.  Looking forward to seeing you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue Nike Hat &amp; I look like my photo</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241039859000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240318652000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis - April 25 - Saturday</name><id>10233104</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240664400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/10233104/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_2940738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
