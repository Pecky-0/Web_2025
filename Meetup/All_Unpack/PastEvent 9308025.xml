Table linens, stylish lamps, warm wall colors, and a cool wine bin display create a hip and elegant ambience. The focus of the cuisine is an exploration of Mediterranean flavors presented in updated, modern dishes. You will find an array of small plates, great for sharing or sampling while either in the dining area or at the bar with cocktails. Entrees are creative and satisfying. The extensive wine list is an adventure in moderately priced, global wines chosen to bring out the subtle flavors of the food. The friendly staff at Bin 100 is professional, yet casual, and strives to give guests an unforgettable experience. We invite you to join us and see why we make every occasion a special occasion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Table will be under my name!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shelly</member_name><member_id>4859230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238023793000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228839685000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December Meetup Bin 100</name><id>9308025</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229643000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/9308025/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/6/d/global_6569485.jpeg</photo_url></item>
