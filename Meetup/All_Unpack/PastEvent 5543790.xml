Nate Abele of the &lt;a href="http://www.cakephp.org/" target="_blank"&gt;CakePHP&lt;/a&gt; project will be here to show off the web application framework and answer questions. We'll have time for discussion too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new location is a really nice conference room at the Johnson &amp;amp; Wales Academic Center, with everything that implies (i.e. a projector). It's in the building at the corner of Mathewson and Westminster streets downtown, across from the Hotel Providence. Parking is on the street, so if you're not familiar with the area or think you might run into trouble, email me. I'll give you my cell phone number, which you can call for suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP, and we'll see you there. Until then, happy coding.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Shearer</member_name><member_id>1529786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1176299372000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>PHP Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>php-338</urlname><id>282097</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Providence PHP Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173229326000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence PHP April Meetup</name><id>5543790</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175641200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/php-338/events/5543790/</event_url></item>
