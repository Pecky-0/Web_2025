We will meet at &lt;span style="color : #330000"&gt;Dick Maynard&amp;rsquo;s conserved property in Farmington, NH at 9 am.&amp;nbsp; After the presentation I would like to do a small hike at Blue Job Mountain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's that time of year time when alternating warm days and cold nights make the maple sap run. As appropriate to the season, Dick Maynard and Moose Mountains Regional Greenways will host a Maple Sugaring Fest on Maynard's conserved property in Farmington, on Saturday, March 5, from 9-11 a.m. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maynard has lived for more than 40 years on the extraordinarily picturesque, beautifully maintained, 12-acre Thunder Chimney Farm near the base of Blue Job Mountain. The house and barn date from the 1780s, and the farm is on New Hampshire's historic register. The land itself features dramatic wooded uplands that sweep up from an open field, orchards, a stream, a pond and wetlands, all visible from the road after the snow has melted.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About 15 years ago, Maynard decided to recreate the type of maple sugaring operation that he was familiar with from his childhood in Northfield, Mass. He hand-built a traditional sugar house, beautifully crafted and equipped with a commercial-grade wood-fired evaporator. Each year, Maynard collects the sap from neighbors' trees and boils it down into syrup.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The upcoming MMRG-sponsored Sugaring Fest is an opportunity for the public to join in the fun, witness this snapshot into one of New England's beloved rural traditions, tour Maynard's lovely conserved property, and get a free taste of real homemade maple "tea"!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks go to Dick Maynard for opening his sugar house for this event and for his generous donation of the conservation easement on his farm in late 2009, facilitated by Moose Mountains Regional Greenways. Strafford Rivers Conservancy, the Strafford County Conservation District, and the Town of Farmington acted as MMRG's conservation partners and are the primary, executory, and tertiary easement holders, respectively.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks also to McEneaney Survey Associates of Dover for providing a survey free of charge, and to the Town of Farmington for contributing $3,750 toward expenses for this project. Nearly $3,000 in transaction costs remain to be covered for this project; dedicated contributions are still welcome. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The event is free and open to the public. For directions, please call the MMRG Education Coordinator at (603) 978-7125 or e-mail infommrg.info&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299506589000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Let's get together and meetup at the Sugar House, we will see how real maple sugar is made and taste it.</why><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299165665000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Maple Sugaring Fest</name><id>16781963</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299333600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/16781963/</event_url></item>
