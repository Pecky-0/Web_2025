You&amp;rsquo;ll hear people who know George describe him as  &lt;br /&gt;a wonderful, caring, supportive and talented individual, who would rather help someone than be helped. However, he is  &lt;br /&gt;the one who is in need of some help now and you, too, can help us to help George.  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;In April 2010, George was diagnosed with colon cancer, which quickly spread to his liver and lungs. Almost immediately,  &lt;br /&gt;George began undergoing extensive chemotherapy treatments in Boston, and these chemo treatments continue today.  &lt;br /&gt;George was suddenly launched into a courageous battle to save his life. And, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been easy &amp;ndash; weekly trips into  &lt;br /&gt;Boston are tiring and costly - though somehow through it all George manages to keep an amazingly positive outlook and  &lt;br /&gt;spirit. Ask George how he&amp;rsquo;s doing and, no matter what, his response will be, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m great, doing good, alive &amp;hellip; much better  &lt;br /&gt;than the alternative!&amp;rdquo; What a fantastic attitude to have.  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Recently George had to leave his position that he held for 37 years at Holy Cross College to go on disability. Times have  &lt;br /&gt;become a bit difficult. Financial instability in a time of illness is not something any family should have to endure. Anyone  &lt;br /&gt;who has been through it knows this is true. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult enough to fight the battle without worrying about how to manage  &lt;br /&gt;out-of-pocket medical expenses and keep up with the daily bills.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why family and friends have joined together to organize a fund-raiser to help ease any financial hardships George  &lt;br /&gt;and his family may be experiencing. A fund-raiser will be held on Sunday, March 20, 2011, from noon until 6:00 p.m. at  &lt;br /&gt;the College of the Holy Cross Hogan Center and everyone, whether you know George or not, is invited to attend the  &lt;br /&gt;event. An afternoon of fun, food, live entertainment and raffles has been planned. An account to support the fund-  &lt;br /&gt;raiser also has been set up at TD Bank, Grafton Street, Worcester, MA. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to make a cash donation &amp;ndash; any  &lt;br /&gt;TD Bank location in the Worcester will be accepting donations &amp;ndash; checks may be made payable to &amp;ldquo;An afternoon of caring  &lt;br /&gt;for George Query.&amp;rdquo;  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;You can help in other ways, too!!!&amp;nbsp; Raffle items, and/or gift certificates, are desperately needed to support the fund-raiser.  &lt;br /&gt;A program is being designed to support all who donate raffle items. Within the program is also an ad booklet, where you  &lt;br /&gt;can purchase space to promote your business and/or wish George well with a personalized message. Any support you  &lt;br /&gt;can provide will be greatly appreciated. There is no greater pleasure than helping someone in need. We thank you in  &lt;br /&gt;advance for your generosity and look forward to seeing you at the event.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;For more information, please contact the fund-raiser organizer, Pat &amp;ldquo;Giggles&amp;rdquo; McHugh at 508-340-0721.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Hogan Center from Noon to 6</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300715042000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>George is a Worcester Photo Meetup member and needs help...</why><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299606112000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An afternoon of caring for George Query</name><id>16845882</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1300636800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/16845882/</event_url></item>
