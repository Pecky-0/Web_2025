 RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT! &lt;br /&gt;

 Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go hiking or snow shoeing on the Foster’s Pond Natural Area trails in Windham NH. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I plan on hiking for approximately two hours, while taking many small breaks along the way. &lt;br /&gt;

 We will meet at 1:00pm sharp, at the Nashua Rd, entrance, just behind the soccer fields. Please follow these directions. From the Nashua area, take Route 111 East into Windham. Take a left on Meetinghouse Rd, travel about 1.4 miles and take a right on Nashua Rd. You will see the soccer fields on you left about ¼ mi down. I will have a Meetup sign. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers for comfort. &lt;br /&gt;

 This event is at no cost! I hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;

 Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897 Do not RSVP no. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Location: Foster’s Pond, Nashua Rd, Windham NH &lt;br /&gt;
