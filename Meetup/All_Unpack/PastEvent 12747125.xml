It's that time againâ€”to pay homage to the Irish, or succumb to the temptation to find your best Emerald Isle accent at the bottom of a pint glass. Whatever the reason, join us as we celebrate St. Patrick's Day on March 20th from 2 - 5 p.m. in Kenmore Square. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is open to ALL group members, plus 3 non-member pals. But there's a catch; RSVPs must be in by March 17 (the real St. Patrick's Day). Cost is $5 per person to cover tax + gratuity. The venue will graciously serve up some appetizers for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, there will be at least one raffle prize. Maybe more, since I'm feelin' festive. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell your friends. Share this on Facebook. Let's make our first-ever St. Pat's Celebration one for the history books!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Alicia &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get in the mood by watching this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/6332831" target="_blank"&gt;http://vimeo.com/6332...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have space reserved just for us. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alicia</member_name><member_id>8353321</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269281153000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>beer buffs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CraftBeerCrew</urlname><id>1469154</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Craft Beer Crew</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267475924000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Luck o' the Irish Celebration</name><id>12747125</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269108000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CraftBeerCrew/events/12747125/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/a/global_13406602.jpeg</photo_url></item>
