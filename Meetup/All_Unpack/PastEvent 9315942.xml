So whoever signs up first can play with us.   If you or someone else is a member of the Brandeis Gym you can obviously play as well, but my partner only feels comfortable having two more guests.   You can put your name on the waiting list in case someone cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I am a low to intermediate player.   I haven't played since last winter so when I start out the balls sometimes going flying in all directions until I get warmed up :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fees:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$2 for the courts&lt;br /&gt;$5 for the meetup group&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to playing again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Fox&lt;br /&gt;Organizer&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the check in booth at the front entrance - my cell is 617-894-8454</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rob Fox</member_name><member_id>4368625</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232919536000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228940258000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doubles Tennis at Brandies University</name><id>9315942</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229270400000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/9315942/</event_url></item>
