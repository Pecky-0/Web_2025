<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please take a moment to read the ENTIRE update, as I have updated  the new meetup dates/locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MEETUPS AT 11:00AM and 1:00PM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will now be hosting TWO meetups! For those of you who have been unable attend due to time conflicts, we will continue to hold our regular Meetups on &lt;b&gt;Sunday&lt;/b&gt; as well as on the 4th &lt;b&gt;Saturday&lt;/b&gt; of every month, 1-3pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: tomato"&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;  Starting in June we will begin our outdoor season as well!!! As we have done so in the past, we host both indoor/outdoor meetups on SUNDAYS!! &lt;br /&gt;I can not stress enough that it is imperative that you RSVP for the event and write in which location you will be attending! Doggie Day will continue to accommodate our usual numbers but since indoor/outdoor events are held on the same day, you don't want to get to the park and have no one there (outdoor meetups do not have number caps for obvious reasons!!!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday June 8th both indoor/outdoor meetups begin!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those who would like to be outdoors we will be meeting at BOSTON COMMON,  the green near the Boylston T Stop....(same location as last year)...&lt;b&gt;Meeting time will be 11:00 AM&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For those who would like to be Indoors ( or head over after the park, this meetup will be held at Doggie day &lt;b&gt;(1-3pm)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should anyone have any questions, feel free to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;Susana&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan</member_name><member_id>2067938</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213110535000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Chihuahua Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>chihuahua-99</urlname><id>32412</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Chihuahua Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>43</yes_rsvp_count><created>1210529308000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chihuahua June Meeting</name><id>7917758</id><headcount>43</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212937200000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chihuahua-99/events/7917758/</event_url></item>
