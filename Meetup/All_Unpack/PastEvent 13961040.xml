Upon returning to Scotland, they are forced into the claustrophobic nature of high society. Esme does not take well to this aafter a shocking scene at a ball, she is sent away to a mental institution. There she is completely forgotten and abandoned for sixty years, until the institution is closed and its residents reintegrated into society. An unsuspecting grand-niece is suddenly Esme's guardian; and Esme brings more than a few family secrets out of the ward when she leaves.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very much in the vein of our own THE GHOST WRITER, this is creepy Victorian fare for readers of Poe, James, and Daphne DuMaurier or more recently Susanna Clarke, Elizabeth Kostova, and Sarah Waters. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annie</member_name><member_id>1543974</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kris</member_name><member_id>10573659</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286237503000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paradisecityreaders</urlname><id>1404829</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Paradise City Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277917754000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox, Maggie O'Farrell</name><id>13961040</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286233200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paradisecityreaders/events/13961040/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/6/0/global_12228608.jpeg</photo_url></item>
