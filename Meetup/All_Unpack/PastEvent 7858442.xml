The land was cleared for pasture in previous centuries, has been logged several times, and now consists primarily of a mixed hardwood forest with trees between 20 and 60 years of age.  The property includes a series of streams, ponds, swamps, and numerous wetlands totaling approximately 60 acres.  A power line easement traverses the property, creating a shrubland undergrowth area.  A small sandpit was created by previous owners, but sand has not been removed for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logging roads formed the basis of what is today a trail network used by hikers, bikers, hunters, snowmobilers, horse back riders, etc.  This trail network does cover the majority of the property, however, leaving large areas without defined access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The varied terrain, habitat, and large areas of undisturbed open space have encouraged a wide variety of wildlife to thrive on the property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the map, the main loop is approximately 4.2 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhnp.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hhnp.org/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It is wild turkey season, but by law they can only hunt until noon.  Be on the safe side though and don't wear red.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the parking lot.
