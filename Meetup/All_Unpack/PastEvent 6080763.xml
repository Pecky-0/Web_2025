This is adjacent Nickerson State Park, so we can make a stop at the beach, too. We should be back at the starting point by 4 or 5 o'clock. Total cycling time should be about 2 hours at a moderate pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can come just on Sat for the ride, or spend the weekend on the cape. I will be staying on the cape camping for 3 days at the North of Highland campground, which is out near the end of the cape. Please reserve a site if you would like to join me for camping. I can also have a second tent on my site. Some people have indicated that they would like to stay at a hotel. Either way, we can make plans to spend some time together on Saturday after the ride and on Sunday too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cobies.com/menu.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cobies.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rail Trail website and map at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/southeast/ccrt.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.capecodcamping.com/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.capecodcam...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(508)487-1191 &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188230766000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Leisure Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-235</urlname><id>527341</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>Boston Leisure Bicycling</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185470066000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cape Cod Rail Trail</name><id>6080763</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188057600000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-235/events/6080763/</event_url></item>
