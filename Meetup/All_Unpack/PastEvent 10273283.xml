Come to share, have fun, raise vibration and focus &amp;quot;downstream&amp;quot; to a more joyful, fulfilling life! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get acquainted, we will do an exercise in which each person introduces themselves, shares about 2-3 minutes with the group one of the Abraham-Hicks processes that has helped them to turn downstream and focus positively on what they want and has helped reduce/eliminate resistance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will listen to some dialogues from an Abraham-Hicks workshop, and then have a group discussion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will learn about the &lt;b&gt;Emotional Guidance Scale&lt;/b&gt; and how to use it to feel better. Learn how to use this process to reduce resistance on an issue where you're feeling &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; or feel like you’re not moving forward so that you may get into your Vibrational Escrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will share an example of how to choose better thoughts and work yourself up the Emotional Guidance Scale. If a thought feels better, it is. If a thought feels worse, discard it and try again for a better feeling thought. As Abraham says as a basis, there are two emotions: &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;worse.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we'll hear Abraham do it, we will do it with one person in the group as a way to see it in action. Then we will do it on our own on paper and if there is time, discuss it with another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be molding the clay here and having fun with our individual desires……as Abraham says, &amp;quot;We are always evolving so you never get it wrong because you never get it done!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shannon Brophy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/members/121214/"&gt;http://lawofattractio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Susan Conley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/members/7459189/"&gt;http://lawofattractio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chew-Hoong</member_name><member_id>3101506</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243990628000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Law of Attraction Co-Creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lawofattraction-us</urlname><id>368525</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Law of Attraction Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240796104000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Abraham Hicks Discussion</name><id>10273283</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243378800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lawofattraction-us/events/10273283/</event_url></item>
