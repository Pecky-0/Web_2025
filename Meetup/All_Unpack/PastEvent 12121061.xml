MassLPA will be hosting its annual &amp;quot;Patriot Christmas Party&amp;quot; on January 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;Please mark your calendar for this fantastic event. Every once in a while we need to step back and do something just for us. This event is open to the public and we hope to see lots of kids running around too. If you're bringing your kids, please let us know ASAP so we can pass the word to Santa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a &amp;quot;Patriot Gift Swap&amp;quot; for those that wish to participate. Gifts are totally optional and should be priced at or under the $25 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although organizers will be bringing some basic refreshments, we are encouraging party-goers to bring your favorite dish or snack item for the potluck table. BYOB too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be sending out personal invitations to all of the liberty minded candidates we've met this year and all of the great guests we've been honored to host as well, so you just never know who's going to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP right now so our organizers can plan appropriately. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The party will be on the fourth floor....plenty of free parking available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Dwyer&lt;br /&gt;cell: 508-930-5530&lt;br /&gt;MassLPA.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Azzola</member_name><member_id>5949757</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262726164000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1690</urlname><id>950430</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261337516000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Patriot Christmas Party</name><id>12121061</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262552400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1690/events/12121061/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/5/b/global_2993979.jpeg</photo_url></item>
