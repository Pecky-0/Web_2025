Or...this is just a good excuse to get together with fellow atheists in a great venue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet outside the Huntington Avenue main entrance at 1:00, walk around the museum for a while, and then go out for coffee or snacks in the surrounding area if anyone's interested. We can split up and then meet up again if people want to venture in different directions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus- if you're a student/staff member at one of the area universities check to see if your school allows you to enter the museum for free or check out your local library, as many in the area have free passes to the MFA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.mfa.org&lt;/a&gt; for directions and related information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you would like to, please bring in canned goods to this or any event during November.  At the end of the month we will be donating these goods to the Greater Boston Food Bank on behalf of the Boston Atheists.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess M</member_name><member_id>7718913</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258395810000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Freethinkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonatheists</urlname><id>12763</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Atheists Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257384659000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Atheists at the Art Museum</name><id>11798539</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258221600000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonatheists/events/11798539/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/c/d/global_9053837.jpeg</photo_url></item>
