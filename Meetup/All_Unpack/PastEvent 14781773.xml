Her main focus is dream incubation, a method of dreaming on demand in order to obtain an answer to a question asked before sleep. The advantage of this technique is to learn how to use dreams as a practical and reliable source of information when facing the unknown and multiple choices. It allows to take reasonable risks at times of uncertainties and ultimately to fulfill with certitude our mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are the topics that will be addressed during the first hour:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • How to dream at will.&lt;br /&gt; • Why do we need to collaborate with our dreams and open up to clairvoyance.&lt;br /&gt; • How to use dream incubation to check the accuracy of dream messages. &lt;br /&gt; • How to interpret induced dreams.&lt;br /&gt; • How to confirm our interpretations. &lt;br /&gt; • How to turn this great tool into a source of revenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second hour will be dedicated to help the participants understand small incubated dreams portraying:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • A theme recommended for this specific group.&lt;br /&gt; • Yes /no questions on different topics. &lt;br /&gt; • The 5 types of dream answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your own dreams are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isabelle Torroella&lt;/b&gt; has devoted twenty years of daily dream incubation to create a working structure for anyone interested in communicating with their dream mind and tap into knowledge that cannot be acquired with conscious means alone. Her approach is presented in her book &lt;i&gt;Dare Asking Your Dreams for Answers&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After studying law and languages she decided to major in art in her native France and became interested in promoting new outlooks and ways of living. She enjoys anything that cultivates individualization such as homeschooling her children, artistic creativity, alternative medicine, yoga revisited, teaching languages together with another topic. Once she heard about the possibility of dreaming at will, she decided to experiment with sought dreams on her own to see how far an individual can be guided from within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She worked in the art field for 15 years and taught her dreamwork at the Ann Wigmore Institute. She presently dreams for people and is a consultant to decipher incubated dreams. She hopes to form groups that would develop this specialty, and would like to assist writers in publishing books on any subject seen from the point of view of sought dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit her website at &lt;a href="http://www.dreamsforanswers.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.dreamsforanswers.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payment is $10 and can be made online or in person.
