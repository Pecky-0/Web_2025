<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This meetup we will be exploring back restoring postures. Modern life is full of tasks that can result in slouching and increased forward flexion of the major posture muscles of the torso, hips, and shoulders. This meeting will include asanas that strengthen the major back muscles, increase awareness of the way we carry our body and the way that our breath is affected by body position. Use of props may be included as well as an introduction to back bending. As always the meetings are free of charge and everyone is encouraged to bring fliers for other events that can be of interest to the group. Also bring ideas for future meeting topics and everyone is encouraged to share their ideas and lead meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup will be held at the &lt;a href="http://www.fvpt.com/YogaProgram.html" target="_blank"&gt;FVPT Yoga Studio&lt;/a&gt;. We will also take a survey of whether or not members will want our next meeting to be outside for yoga asanas and/or meditation and what location to have such an &amp;quot;outside meetup&amp;quot; will take place.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179007608000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175814469000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Central CT Yoga Meetup</name><id>5642121</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178834400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/5642121/</event_url></item>
