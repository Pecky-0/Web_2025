Turn Left on &lt;br /&gt;Morse Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park near Morse Park.  Walk over to &lt;br /&gt;Chicks Drive Inn at the other end of the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If members want, they can go to Chicks. &lt;br /&gt;There is probably parking next to Morse Park&lt;br /&gt;Next to Chicks. I can walk over to Chicks.  We can watch the Firework from&lt;br /&gt;Either in front of Chicks or a few blocks closer to the&lt;br /&gt;Right facing the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should bring at least a flash light, blanket, maybe a lounge chair &lt;br /&gt;and if you have one a portable &lt;br /&gt;Radio to hear which every radio station is paying&lt;br /&gt;Music with the Fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wfsb.com/fourthofjuly/13573002/detail.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wfsb.com/f...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.wfsb.com/fourthofjuly/13573002/detail.html&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;West Haven: Bradley Point. 9:30 p.m.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/566615/Branford-East-Haven-Savin" target="_blank"&gt;http://activerain.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;activerain.com/blogsview/566615/Branford-East-Haven-Savin&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would say that we need to meet at Chicks by 8:15 to&lt;br /&gt;8:30 to get settled for the West Haven Fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If no members come, then I will just stay home.&lt;br /&gt;It is easier for me to watch the New Haven&lt;br /&gt;Fire Works than the West Haven Fireworkd.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Members can go to Chicks.
