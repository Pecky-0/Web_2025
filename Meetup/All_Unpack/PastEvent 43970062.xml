A hard days work on the campaign trail couldn&amp;#146;t be better capped off than with fellow Ron Paul Supporters, a light case of frostbite, wa...rm food, cold drink, and the dream of victory. You can help us make that happen. We&amp;#146;d like to sponsor an event in New Hampshire so that we can all come together after a long week of knocking on doors and passing out literature. We need to raise $5000.00 to provide the grassroots sponsorship. Here are the details: When: Saturday, January 7, 2012 at 11:00am until Sunday, January 8, 2012 at 1:00am Where: Jillian&amp;#146;s Billiards Club of Manchester 50 Phillippe Cote Street Manchester, New Hampshire 03101 (603) 626-7636 THIS IS IT! Everything we&amp;#146;ve been working for will come down to New Hampshire. We need all the people we can get to come to New Hampshire and help campaign for Ron Paul. We&amp;#146;ll also be throwing a huge debate watch party which will include great speakers/performers and FREE food!
