Further to the east on the lake is a beach area that would be an excellent place to sit on the sand to eat some snacks. And to practice paddle float entries...if you have not one of these things...its a real life saver....&lt;br /&gt;you will see why..oh yeh and a pump...sponge , bail bucket..is ok too..but no where near the capacity of a good pump...&lt;br /&gt;Reason 1..standing in the mud up to your waiste is not fun if you even make it that far to the shore..most likely you are going to die here like those stickey traps for mice....reason 2 :better to pop back in fast, pump out fast and get going...There is hungry LEACHES, EELS, and Frankenstein Fish in there....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;Rte 384 East to Bolton Notch (off of rte 84 in East Hartford / Manchester line area)&lt;br /&gt;Follow 384 to the end..&lt;br /&gt;Continue on Rte 44 E (left part of fork) rte 6 is to the right, stay on 44&lt;br /&gt;There is a traffic light with a post office and a small shopping area to the right, continue to the next light. &lt;br /&gt;The next light has the boat launch to the left and a church to the right. (across from South Road)&lt;br /&gt;Enter the boat launch area. &lt;br /&gt;I carry my kayak on a old sailboat trailer so im easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mapquest, GPS and others use 1,000 Boston Turnpike (rte 44) Bolton to get you close enough..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184597239000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183995373000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunset Paddle on Bolton Lake, Bolton CT...Well and something MORE</name><id>5995948</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184367600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5995948/</event_url></item>
