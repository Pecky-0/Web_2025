<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This will be an easy hike up the access road to the top where there is a fire tower. Oak Hill's Summit is 990' that has a 442' vertical gain and the one way time of the hike should be about&amp;nbsp;a 1/2 hour. This hike is also on the list to receive a hiking patch from NH Division of Forest and Lands if you hike 5 or more of the fire towers in the state. You can get more info at 
&lt;a href="http://www.nhdfl.org"&gt;www.nhdfl.org&lt;/a&gt; . Even though this is a short hike please come prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Directions to trailhead:&lt;/strong&gt; From I-93 North in Concord, take Exit 16, taking a right off the ramp. At the subsequent junction, go straight onto Shawmut Street, which becomes Oak Hill Road. The gated Oak Hill Summit Road will eventually be on the left side of the road, with some room to park on the right shoulder of the road.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at 5:30pm between LL Bean and Hanafords in back parking lot.
