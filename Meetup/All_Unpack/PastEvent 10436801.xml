(in general my skating events will be for all comers.)  i'll hang with 'the pack' (if there is one), but you're all welcome to come and go as you please.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>i'll email a cell # to everyone who RSVPs 'Yes' or 'Maybe' by 25 may, 11 a.m.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>paul</member_name><member_id>4738108</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243983941000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242657153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>memorial day skate</name><id>10436801</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243270800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/10436801/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/8/global_1713624.jpeg</photo_url></item>
