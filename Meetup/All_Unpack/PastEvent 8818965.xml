<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Members,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have our Boston Maltese Meet this coming Sunday on September 28th at Especially for Pets in Sudbury, 81 Union Ave, 978 443 7682.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will be 12 - 3 pm.  We have to stop exactly at 3 pm because there is a dog class scheduled at 3pm.  Thus clean up has to start at 2:30 and ALL help will be gratefully accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to keep costs down, mine included since I have always managed to spend more money on food and rent than is taken in at the Meet, I would like to change to a POT LUCK format.  If everyone that is coming can bring something, even a drink, or ice, or whatever, we will munch on those offerings.  That way our Meet will only cost $5 per household so that we can pay the $45 in rent that Especially for Pets charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can email me directly if you have questions about what to bring:  laptopmaltese@aol.com.&lt;br /&gt;But please do come, even if you cannot bring anything.  We'd rather see you and your Maltese than not see you!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to our first Meet in four months!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maltese best,&lt;br /&gt;Kim&lt;br /&gt;508 380 6829&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have my name tag on which says Kim</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kim Lemaire</member_name><member_id>1963654</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226865167000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Small dog owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-2</urlname><id>98818</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Maltese and Tiny Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222212018000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BOSTON MALTESE MEET</name><id>8818965</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222617600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-2/events/8818965/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/c/global_83228.jpeg</photo_url></item>
