This gives everyone a chance to spend time and have conversation with new friends. The goal is to have equal numbers of men and women. Our private dining room will have 7 tables of 8 or so, depending on our count.  If you're a man, go ahead and give your &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; rsvp.  If you're a woman that would like to attend, you must bring a +1 man ie. your brother, friend, co-worker......(not a date).  When you rsvp &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; list the &lt;b&gt;first name&lt;/b&gt; of your male guest.  Your +1 RSVP requires a $10 reservation fee to be applied to the evening cost of $34.50.   The &lt;b&gt;+1 guest&lt;/b&gt; will be required to pay $34.50  at the door.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival there will be a cocktail hour - cash bar, followed by a 4 course sit down dinner.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will hold the event regardless of attendence numbers or gender mix &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dinner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank's Steakhouse owner, George Ravanis has put together a special 4-course dinner for the evening.
