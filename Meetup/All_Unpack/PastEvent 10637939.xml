I sent out an email a little over a week ago wondering if there were any 9 -10 minute milers out there who don't run at the crack of dawn. I received several replies so I thought I'd organize something official. This is my first week of training for the Marine Corps Marathon and I'm planning to do a 7.5 mile run along the Charles tomorrow beginning at Panera Bread in Watertown (395 Arsenal Street, Arsenal on the Charles). I picked this location because there's lots of available parking. I am going to run at 9:00 AM. If you'd like to join me (misery loves company), you'll be able to spot me in front of Panera pretty easily. I'll be the neurotic brunette with the &amp;quot;Oh God, no one is going to show up&amp;quot; look on my face. Please let me know if you'd like to attend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>heidi</member_name><member_id>8485896</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245071658000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244825621000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday 7.5 Mile Run Along the Charles</name><id>10637939</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244898000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/10637939/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
