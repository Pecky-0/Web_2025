The United Nations has called them the &amp;quot;Lost Boys of the Sudan&amp;quot;.  These boys, by themselves, walked literally a thousand miles across the desert, to save their lives.  A few years later they needed to again walk hundreds of miles to Kenya.  Growing international attention on the war in Sudan had the US accept some as refugees.  &lt;br /&gt;The film follows several of these lost boys, both in Kenya where they stayed in a refugee camp for ten years and their journey to &amp;amp; life in the US.  It is an important film because it shows the personal cost of the now 20 years of war in Sudan.  The situation of their life is intense and their way of sharing about it is deeply moving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us and invite your friends and their friends,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie will be followed by refreshments and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Center of Light is on the Orange Line - Stonybrook T-stop.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219016414000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213642208000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie:  "God Grew Tired of Us"</name><id>8153321</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218843000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/8153321/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/3/3/global_5133379.jpeg</photo_url></item>
