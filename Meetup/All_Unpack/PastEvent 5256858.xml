So here is our plan for the big night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you will bring a dish or dessert to share with all of us. Anything simple, fun, and festive will do. No fretting allowed, do what ever you are comfortable with. It's all good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you will also bring one wrapped - that means so no one can see it - photo. We'd like it to be matted and signed, so who ever ends up with it knows who created the image. You may frame the image but only if you want to, it is not required. Anyone who wants to participate will be asked to place there name on a slip of paper and it will be placed in a box. Each person will get the chance to pick an image from the festive pile when their name is called. It's that simple. I must say that last year I got a truely amazing piece and hope that each one of you choses to participate. It's a really nice way to start a collection of photographic work...So please ~ join in. If anyone has questions about this feel free to contact Donna or Scott.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd also like to do a group photo, I am just warning you all ahead of time! What would the Photo Meet up be if we didn't bring out our cameras....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for a night of Cheer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has suggestions or comment about the event - please feel free to share with Donna or Scott. Till next time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1166315744000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163122660000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography December Meetup</name><id>5256858</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1166142600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/5256858/</event_url></item>
