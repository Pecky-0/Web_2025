Many strange and tragic happenings have been attributed to the curse.&lt;br /&gt;Meet at Champney Falls parking lot on Route 112 in Passaconaway (I-93 to exit 32 in Lincoln). &lt;br /&gt;The parking area is about 1.5 miles east of Bear Notch Road and about a half hour from downtown Lincoln. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike is 7.6 miles with a 2250' of elevation gain. It should take us about 7 hours round trip. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike has spectacular autumn 360 degree views with two waterfalls on the descent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress for fall weather hiking with an exposed summit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40% rain cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is believed that Chocorua was a real Indian, although no authentic records of his life exist. About 1720 Chocorua was on friendly terms with settlers and, in particular, the Campbell family that had a home in the valley now called Tamworth. Chocorua was called away and left his son in the care of the Campbell family. The boy found and drank a poison that Mr. Campbell had made to eliminate troublesome foxes, and Chocorua returned to find his son had died. Chocorua, distraught with grief, pledged revenge on the family. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Campbell returned home one afternoon to find his wife and children had been slain. Campbell suspected Chocorua and pursued him up the mountain that today bears his name. Chocorua was wounded by a shot from Campbell's rifle. Before Campbell could reach Chocorua, he uttered a curse upon the white settlers and their homes, livestock, and crops, and leapt from the summit to his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are at least three other versions of the legend of Chocorua. One is that Chocorua simply fell from a high rock on the mountain while hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A second is the white men pursued Chocorua up the mountain after an Indian massacre, and he was not shot at all but simply leapt to his death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third is that all the white men pursued him with guns, pitchforks, and torches. They collapsed of exhaustion as Chocorua reached the top, and the white men decided to torch the remaining trees up to the summit, and in doing so they burned and exposed the topsoil of the last 1270 feet. As the flames drew closer and closer to Chocorua, he cursed the white men and leapt to his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The curse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The east face of Mount Chocorua from Carter Ledge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although no one can know the exact words of Chocorua's curse (or even if there was a curse), it has been reported  to be as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;quot;May the Great Spirit curse you when he speaks in the clouds and his words are fire! Lightning blast your crops! Wind and fire destroy your homes! The Evil One breathe death on your cattle! Panthers howl and wolves fatten on your bones!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another version of Chocorua's curse appears in the story 'Chocorua's Curse' (by the author of another famous Indian work, 'Hobomok'), contained in 'The Token' (1830):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    'A curse upon ye, white men! May the Great Spirit curse ye when he speaks in the clouds, and his words are fire! Chocorua had a son — and ye killed him while the sky looked bright! Lightning, blast your crops! Wind and fire destroy your dwellings! The Evil Spirit breathe death upon your cattle! Your graves lie in the war path of the Indian! Panthers howl, and wolves fatten over your bones! Chocorua goes to the Great Spirit — his curse stays with the white men!'&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256648875000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253581361000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Haunted Hikes:  Mt Chocorua via Champney Falls</name><id>11432132</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256475600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/11432132/</event_url></item>
