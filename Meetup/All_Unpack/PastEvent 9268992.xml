You might want to consider the following questions:  What makes good, realistic dialogue?  &lt;br /&gt;What strategies do you use to find a character's voice?  &lt;br /&gt;How much dialogue is necessary to a text?  &lt;br /&gt;Where is dialogue needed?  &lt;br /&gt;When is dialogue most affective?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)  Two writers have volunteered to bring writing for us to discuss.  Both Jessie and Bill have posted their work for us to discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to some good discussion and I'm currently on the hunt for a good, productive working space for our meetups.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be there trying to save seats and reading</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kate E.</member_name><member_id>7904632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231287889000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228266804000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Delightful Discussion about Dialogue and Other Such Things</name><id>9268992</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229472000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/9268992/</event_url></item>
