Currently the Saints are one of ONLY two undefeated teams left in the NFL and are considered to have the best offense in the game of football. Come and watch this clash of the titans - Tom Brady and The New England Patriots vs. Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game begins at 8:30PM but you'll need to get there earlier to help me with saving seats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Clarke's:&lt;br /&gt;Established in 1974, &amp;quot;Clarke's at Faneuil Hall&amp;quot; is a fixture in Boston's Historic Faneuil Hall.
