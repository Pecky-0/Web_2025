The event will include a vegan box lunch (we are a group open to anyone interested in vegan dining for a day, an hour whenever - we are NOT an exclusive group of vegans!), a tour with lots of information from Mona Jerome the founder, Katie (yes, THIS katie) and Michelle Melaragno, the director of the Maine Equine Welfare Alliance. All ages welcome, cost in $12 for the lunch with payment due by September 9th. Feel free to check out our group event at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Meatless-Mainers/events/25457591/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt; or contact me directly for more information at seconroy@gmail.com. You do need to let us know you are coming please! Thanks for inviting me to post, Katie and thank to all of your for your interest! Cheers!
