Amid the gleaming towers of a gigantic city of the future the pampered son of the big boss himself is smitten by a young woman and follows her into the depths of the city – where he discovers what really makes Metropolis run. As slavishly regimented workers with numbers instead of names toil amid smoke-belching machinery, he has a vision of slaves lining up for sacrifice. Meanwhile, his father anticipates unrest and makes plans to defuse it, inciting an eccentric inventor to fashion an agent provocateur, the “robot-Maria” – one of the most indelible icons of science fiction film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer of 2008, the curator of the Buenos Aires Museo del Cine discovered a 16mm negative of METROPOLIS. It included 25 minutes of “lost” footage, about a fifth of the film, that had not been seen since its Berlin debut. The Buenos Aires negative provided a definite blueprint to the cutting of METROPOLIS – which in the past had been a matter of conjecture. This brand new restoration (the successor to an extensive 2001 overhaul) reinstates the original editing, restoring the balance between the characters and subplots of this landmark film.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick </member_name><member_id>8396650</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>8</waitlist_count><updated>1281197161000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279413470000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Metropolis (Complete Restored Version) @ The Brattle Theatre!</name><id>14133212</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281135600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14133212/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/7/d/global_16486733.jpeg</photo_url></item>
