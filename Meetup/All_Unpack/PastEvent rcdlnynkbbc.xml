Is it what you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to be creating?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this meetup we'll be discussing the &amp;quot;stories&amp;quot; you tell (how you talk and think about a topic) and how to best language them so that you'll be creating the experiences you want to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a part of this, we'll also be covering how to speak and how to use affirmations in a way that is truly believable to you.  Otherwise, you will still create what you don't want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll take some time to uncover a story you might be carrying that's holding you back; and then you'll get to shift it to something that will be more effective and will feel better, too!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to RSVP, and after you do so,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt; let us know if your plans change, so we wonâ€™t be waiting for you unnecessarily or waste any handouts and snacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;There's nothing better than feeling good and having fun! Please join us and &lt;b&gt;stay &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; by participating in our community's message board discussions and receiving our e-mails (which will include our &amp;quot;Good Vibrations&amp;quot; tips and news).

Hope to hear from you! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eagerly looking forward to co-creating with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please check the files section (under "More" at top of page) for important parking info. and directions</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>6516126</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ann Ide</member_name><member_id>7915265</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281894829000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>deliberate creators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>MetroWest-Law-of-Attraction-Good-Vibrations-meet-up</urlname><id>1276745</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>"Good Vibrations" Metro West Law of Attraction Community</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276063337000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Abrahadabra!
