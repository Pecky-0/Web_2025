The place consists of a bar surrounding an aquarium that at one point supposedly held a shark (rumor has it he died), but still hosts quite a collection of fish and other aquatic creatures.  In addition, there are at least 4 pool tables to play on, a cafe with a large selection of wings and pizza.  And of course, lots of televisions brodcasting every horse and dog race from around the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Hour drink specials run until 7pm:&lt;br /&gt;$2 draft beer&lt;br /&gt;$2.50 well drinks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your contact is: Jeanie (860) 942-4708&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bring a friend***&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238626692000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237946327000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Happy Hour - Sports Haven</name><id>10029310</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238450400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/10029310/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/f/4/global_7829364.jpeg</photo_url></item>
