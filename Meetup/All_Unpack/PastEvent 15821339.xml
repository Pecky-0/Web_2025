<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For those of you, who are finding the money is a little tight this year (like me), and aren't going to The Common Man, for dinner prior to the dance, my home is open for a potluck meal, anytime after 4pm.  We'll eat about 5pm, have a pre New Year's toast, and head to the dance about 7:30ish.  I'm approx. 15 minutes from the Castleton.&lt;br /&gt;In your reply put down what you could bring for eats...I've had enough sweets to last a lifetime...lol.  must have gained 5 lbs. over Christmas :)&lt;br /&gt;I will email my address and telephone number the day before to any &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; responses.&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year...looking forward to starting it out right, with good friends, good food and good will towards men ;)&lt;br /&gt;Susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294063805000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293378650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre New Year's potluck!</name><id>15821339</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293829200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/15821339/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/0/global_20457008.jpeg</photo_url></item>
