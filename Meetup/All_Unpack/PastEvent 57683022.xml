&lt;p&gt;The "Murder Mystery Party" line of murder party games is the most extensive. Part of the Bepuzzled line was originally founded by Lombard Marketing, Inc. University Games acquired Bepuzzled in February 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These games play just like other main-stream murder party games like How to Host a Murder, Evening of Murder, Mysteries by Vincent, or Milton Bradley's Life of the Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody put a barbecue fork through car dealer Tom Dooley, and that somebody is at your dinner party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complete 1950's murder mystery that places your guests as the chief suspects. . Six to eight friends play roles with plenty of scripts and suggestions on how to ham it up. The set includes an audiotape guide, background booklets for each player, special clues (including mysterious checks and blackmail letters), and anything else you need for an evening of unpredictable fun. There are even party invitations and tasty recipes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bobby Sox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chubby Cheddar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Angel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiara Diamond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan Spudnick&lt;/p&gt;
