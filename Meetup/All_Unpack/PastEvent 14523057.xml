The one that has a nice overlook and is right on Veterans Memorial Parkway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 1:00 PM  and the 33 mile ride will go through Seekonk, Swansea, Warren, Barrington, and Bristol. Part goes along the bike path. We'll ride at a easy pace (i.e., about 12 mph). Tom plans to stop for ice cream. People who come should bring a snack.&amp;quot;  He'll be in a grey Kia with a chrome roof rack.  I usually park on the grass, under a tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Note: Adam will NOT be leading this ride&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  If you have questions, concerns or comments, please contact Tom.  His cell is 401-369-5615.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tom's cell is 401-369-5615.
