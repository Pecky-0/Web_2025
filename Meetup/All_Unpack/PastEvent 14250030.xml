It's beautiful!  There is lots of food, a great dj, dance floor, etc.  Or, just sit back, relax (indoors or outdoors) and enjoy the ride!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Autism Allstars are joining forces for the 4th straight year with Captain's Fishing Parties to raise funds for autism research. Please join us for a fun evening cruising down the Merrimack River. There will be a buffet, entertainment, dancing, and a cash bar. Ticket proceeds will go towards the Allstars' fundraising efforts for the 2010 Greater Boston Walk Now for Autism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat wil depart at 6:00 pm sharp, so please try to... arrive by 5:45 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain date will be Sunday, September 12, 2010 (6:00pm to 9:00 pm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are only $35 each (and it's a donation to charity!) and they include the cruise, your dinner, your entertainment, and a donation.
