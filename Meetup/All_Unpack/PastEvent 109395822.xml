They typically hand out more tickets than they got seats, so if you want to go, go early (before 7:00 pm) to ensure getting a seat.&lt;/p&gt;

After India's (Mia Wasikowska's) father dies in an auto accident, her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), who she never knew existed, comes to live with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). Soon after his arrival, she comes to suspect this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives, but instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless girl becomes increasingly infatuated with him. Directed by Park Chan-Wook. &lt;br /&gt;
