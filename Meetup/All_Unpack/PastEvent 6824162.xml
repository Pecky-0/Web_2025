Experience tells us that members like these meetings most of all! There will be plenty of time for everyone to get their say and to ask their question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Feature &lt;br /&gt;Ming will be introducing a new feature for the group that will make our group more vital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets during the hour from 6:00 PM to 6:50 PM.
