Whether you've done any touring yourself or, like me, have not (unless you count riding from Westbrook to the Bike Rally in Yarmouth), it should be very interesting to hear about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Trina's presentation, we can discuss some more ideas about group activities. One exciting idea we have is the Ride My Commute program (see Message Board). Let's decide how this would work. We also generated a number of other ideas at the last meeting, and bring any new ones you have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about expenses. Meetup.com actually charges for use of their site, $19/month. I take in some donations from another group I sponsor (Oil Awareness - &lt;a href="http://oilawareness.meetup.com/169/)"&gt;http://oilawareness.m...&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't always cover it. Plus, if I get more I can buy more food for the events! So that's why you may notice in the event listing that there is now an &amp;quot;Event Fee&amp;quot; of $2 &amp;quot;optional donation&amp;quot;. It's not required, but if you can help out with a dollar or two, that would be great. I'll have my bike helmet sitting out to collect donations at this and future meetings.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1163808631000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1161947935000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trina's Bike Trip</name><id>5226523</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163635200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/5226523/</event_url></item>
