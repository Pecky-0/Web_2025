I know you might be thinking, wtf?  This is an extremely popular book with a cult following.  This book, among others, have been in public domain for a long time.  So, Seth took the entire book and intergrated the literature with zombies.  It may sound strange, but most people I have spoken with who have read the book LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a brief synopsis from Barnes and Noble of &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;So begins Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, an expanded edition of the beloved Jane Austen novel featuring all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie mayhem. As our story opens, a mysterious plague has fallen upon the quiet English village of Meryton — and the dead are returning to life! Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is determined to wipe out the zombie menace, but she’s soon distracted by the arrival of the haughty and arrogant Mr. Darcy. What ensues is a delightful comedy of manners with plenty of civilized sparring between the two young lovers — and even more violent sparring on the blood-soaked battlefield. Can Elizabeth vanquish the spawn of Satan? And overcome the social prejudices of the class-conscious landed gentry? Complete with romance, heartbreak, swordfights, cannibalism, and thousands of rotting corpses, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies transforms a masterpiece of world literature into something you’d actually want to listen to.&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask the bartender or hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob Lamothe</member_name><member_id>6364190</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>7202411</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276136457000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portsmouth-Book-Club</urlname><id>1147811</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273636633000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup - Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</name><id>ckldnynjblb</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276038000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portsmouth-Book-Club/events/13457852/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/6/9/global_14987737.jpeg</photo_url></item>
