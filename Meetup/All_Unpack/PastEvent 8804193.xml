<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hello all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join me for the two features of the MFA’s Palestine Film Festival – “Maria’s Grotto” and “First Picture.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Maria’s Grotto” by Buthina Canaan Khoury (2007, 52 min.) is an unflinching examination of the subject of “honor killings,” still meted out as punishment in some Arab countries that use the tribal system.  Though not a common occurrence in Palestine, the risk is all too real for women who live with the possibility that even a suspicion of “impropriety” can put their lives in danger.  Khoury explores the issue through the stories of four women whose experiences will horrify, enrage, surprise and inspire.  Discussion with director follows screening.  “First Picture” by Akram al-Ashqar (2006, 27 min.) is a touching glimpse at the life of a Palestinian infant just after he is removed from the Israeli penal system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you buy your ticket ahead of time by visiting the &lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org/calendar/event.asp?eventkey=35647&amp;amp;date=10/4/2008" target="_blank"&gt;MFA site.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is our custom, Nina will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row after the film and then it’s off to a local restaurant to discuss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be holding a Meetup sign near the front row after the film.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nina</member_name><member_id>4237709</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>3.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222039595000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Maria’s Grotto preceded by First Picture - Discussion with director to follow</name><id>8804193</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223148600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8804193/</event_url></item>
