Butts in boat at 9:30 AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start from the boat launch on Doanes Hill Road, Royalston. Google it for directions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice slow moving river suitable for beginners.  We will go up river from the landing to Long Pond.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that we will continue further up river from there since there are several beaver dams. We will then return to the landing.  I plan on paddling into the lake after that. You can make this day as long as you want or just a few hours. The last time I was out there we were in the boats for over 6 hours, it is up to you as to how long you want to enjoy this beautiful lake.  Please have water and a lunch with you.  PDF's are required.  There is limited parking at the boat launch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT THE BOAT LAUNCH AT THE DAM. This is the launch near the camp ground.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan L</member_name><member_id>7773139</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277892146000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276734452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tully Lake</name><id>13824948</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277559000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/13824948/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/c/global_2046284.jpeg</photo_url></item>
