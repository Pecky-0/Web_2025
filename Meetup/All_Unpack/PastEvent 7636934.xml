This should be a relaxed and fun opportunity to meet up and chat, maybe get a drink or something to eat, so stop by and bring your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no agenda, but we will probably touch on upcoming events, including an antiwar action on Friday, 18 April, a fundraising party/concert in May, a regional antiwar organizing conference at Tufts on 25-26 April, and of course lots of May Day activities.  We also have presidential and congressional campaigns well under way, and will give updates about recent developments and future prospects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome, nothing is required.
