Otherwise, we will bring an assortment of games, and Gulu-Gulu has their own collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never attended a Meetup at Gulu-Gulu before, we generally have our group spread out over a few tables, though we try to sit as close as possible. We like to start the evenings with simple games (or just conversation) while people are eating. Afterward, we break into smaller groups/tables to play different games depending upon the group size and interest. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulu-Gulu is accessible to most of downtown Salem. Parking can usually be found on Washington St., in the Church St. lot, and in the lot between Lynde and Essex Streets (by the YMCA). Gulu-Gulu has a great food and beverage menu that can be found at www.gulu-gulu.com. I do request that when we hold Meetups in food or drink establishments that everyone in attendance order at least one item or beverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1313600002000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1312147857000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Games at Gulu Gulu</name><id>27726441</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313449200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/27726441/</event_url></item>
