<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, are you ready to meet? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on down for our Babez and Dudez Party !! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Street Grille is a great restaurant....fun and easy!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel stressed, and need a good laugh, you came to the right place.  ----------&amp;gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for a relaxed night of socializing and meeting new people! Let's do Sunday night again! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meals range from 6 dollars, to about 20. Plus the $1 donation here for miscellaneous fees.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The atmosphere is really cool here. The walls have a ton of posters, pictures of famous people, and even a few faces sticking out of the ceiling. The menu is like a comedy show itself. It has all jokes of names of the meals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am taking over this meetup, I am looking for people to come with an idea. Along with the idea, please bring pricing, dates available, menu's, etc. I will assist you with the meetup, but it will be your meetup.  You run the show, and create the fun. For each meetup, we will assign a team to manage each part of it. The team will support you to set it up. Each team member will do a small part, to make it easy for all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be from 7 to 9. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have any ideas, or just want to have fun, come on along. We want to meet you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DRESS CODE FOR THIS MEETUP IS CASUAL.  (JEANS AND SNEAKERS ARE ACCEPTABLE) . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve C. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the PartyExpress Singles Group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fran</member_name><member_id>4013716</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Antoinette </member_name><member_id>5363041</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve C</member_name><member_id>6197158</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alisa</member_name><member_id>9481392</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279498062000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
