It is 21 Lemon St. and the house is pumpkin colored.  There is some parking available on Lemon St. and more parking available on Northey St. (one block closer to the T) and on Cross St. (which tees into Lemon).  Plan on coming earlier to find a spot.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a note again, the house is home to two cats for those who are allergic.  For those who aren't allergic but don't like cats, they will be put away for the evening.  I apologize for those with allergies, we just need more volunteers to host in their cat-free homes.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200116268000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189111845000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>More Board Games</name><id>6310337</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189814400000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/6310337/</event_url></item>
