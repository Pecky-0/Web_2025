&lt;p&gt;This beginner's running schedule has helped thousands or Walkers/Runners get off the couch and onto the Roads, Walking and running 3 miles in just two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people have been turned off of Running simply by trying to start off too fast. Their bodies rebel, and they wind up miserable, wondering why anyone would possibly want to do this to themselves. That Said, I would like People interested in Walking as Well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Me and others on Tuesdays and We may add in another Day as well. Each session should take about 20/30 minutes, and should be done three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;I signed up for a Diva Dash in September! It can be hard getting motivated, so I welcome  support and accountability or others. I can’t always make it to other posted evenings to run so I thought I would open up a meet up when I go to the track please Join Me... On This Running/walking Plan. This will repeat into september may need to adjust based on&lt;/span&gt; school programs. &lt;/p&gt;
