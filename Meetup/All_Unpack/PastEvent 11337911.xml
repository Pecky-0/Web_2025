It's name translates literally as &amp;quot;old-fashioned oven&amp;quot; and it is best known for its brick oven. It's been located on the right-hand side of upper Salem Street for about 16 years. Prices for lunch run as follows: &lt;br /&gt;Salads/Soups/Sandwiches $6-10 Pastas $10-15 Pizzas $8-11. 24.5% will be added to the cost of your food and drink for tax (6.25%) and tip (18%). Cash is the preferred method of payment since we won't have individual checks. After lunch, for those looking for produce bargains, we'll head over to the Haymarket vendors and pick up some fruit and vegetables cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please access our 'About' tab for further guidelines.
