This is an out-and-back style hike where we'll aim to hike 3 hours max. with turnaround at about 1.5 hrs. out. There is plenty of trail so we'll see how far towards the peek we'll get and what lovely winter scenes there will be. I figure 3 - 4 miles of hiking. I'll check signups once at about 1:15 PM today. It might be best to give me a call on my cell if you plan to attend and if you RSVP after 1 PM today, the day of the hike. My cell is in my RSVP. We'll hike on the blue blaze trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hike would start from the trailhead on Hopkins Rd., a dirt road just off of Rte. 140 in Ellington across from Lake Bonair. The hike would be moderately difficult with a fair amount of up/down on the trail and a respectable length of a hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet and park on the shoulder of the Hopkins Rd. dirt road about .1 mile from the intersection with Rte. 140 at 2 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be about 35 F to 45 F for the hike so wear layers for warmth (avoid cotton material). Wear boots as it WILL be snowy and muddy! Bring a quart of water and some trail food/lunch for energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total distance from Hopkins Rd. start - some landmarks we could intersect:&lt;br /&gt;* 2.9 miles to trail intersect with Sykes Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 3.4 miles to trail intersect with Parker Rd. (dirt)&lt;br /&gt;* 4.6 miles to peak &amp;amp; observation tower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location/Directions via MapQuest for Hopkins Rd. approximate trailhead (on right of Rd.):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&amp;amp;address=%5b1%2d19%5d%20Hopkins%20Rd&amp;amp;city=Ellington&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;zipcode=06029&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;location=4YWq4%2f6LEHnb7KcPQYTqXzAZv9Lg3%2f%2bvvkDT5UtoEdqBJjTWFKz7f9MGRaO7yalWkG3OIleRkDXgncOOFEjdbgEHM25yoblV3Z%2f25Jm6jZSLP4J7onkQFrBXU6UfV%2buxDYkYHsfNiIlpZ9flYEQPhg%3d%3d&amp;amp;ambiguity=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail Map at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/stateparks/maps/shenipsitgis.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this one in Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt; ) so please direct questions to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
