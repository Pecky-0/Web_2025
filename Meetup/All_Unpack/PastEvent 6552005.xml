Anybody up for some easy leads?  Give me a call if you are coming.&lt;br /&gt;Geoff&lt;br /&gt;617 501-6217&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crow Hill is likely the best climbing in MA. Plenty of routes and a 90 foot tall wall in spots. You can lead here too (at your own risk.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring ropes and slings if you have them. You should know how to belay and have a harness with a carabiner and belay device. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a helmet if you have one. &lt;br /&gt;Also, there are no facilities. Bring water, food, sunscreen, camera, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact me for rides: Not sure about a car pool yet.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Crow Hill. (Leominster State Park)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/lmsf.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/central/lmsf.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;Take route 2 to rt 31 south (exit 28) go south 1.3 miles to park head quarters. (get free climbing permit.) There are two Parking lots. Go to the second parking lot on the left. You will see picknick tables.  Lets meet at the picnic tables at 11am.  If you are late cross the street and go up the trail (Marked in blue blazes.) It's up hill and you should see the cliff in about 15 minutes of hiking.  &lt;br /&gt;- Geoff 617 501-6217&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193152147000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192436068000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Top Roping at Crow Hill Sunday Oct 21st</name><id>6552005</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192978800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/6552005/</event_url></item>
