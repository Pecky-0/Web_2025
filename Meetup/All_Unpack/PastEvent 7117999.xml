Expect DJs to spin hip-hop all night in a lively atmosphere.  A fun place to meet new people and to get your groove on!  All members welcome, and feel free to bring a friend or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: We will meet at 8:30pm in the bar area at the new Hard Rock Cafe (22-24 Clinton St, formerly known at The Rack), which is located right next to Faneuil Hall.  We will head over to Boston Rocks! around 10:00pm to beat the lines.  Please meet us at the Hard Rock (before 10pm), as you may not find us later.  Cover:  Expect to pay $10, but it might be less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIND THE ORGANIZER: My picture is located on the left-hand side of the site.
