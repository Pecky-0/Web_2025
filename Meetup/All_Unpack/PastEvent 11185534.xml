Who wants to come? Sign up here... &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/calendar/11268440/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show is Saturdays at Midnight. Let's meet up at 11:30 pm on Saturday to get tickets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever seen the cult classic &lt;b&gt;Rocky Horror Picture show&lt;/b&gt;, with Tim Curry playing a &amp;quot;sweet transvestite&amp;quot; of a mad doctor who is trying to make a boytoy for himself? Have you gone to Harvard Square, at the AMC Loews on Church Street, Saturdays at Midnight, where the &amp;quot;Full Body Cast&amp;quot; dresses up as the characters and lip-syncs to the movie as the audience, er, participates in watching the film? &lt;i&gt;( No? Pardon me, you'll have to go to the stage where the the, er, &amp;quot;virgins&amp;quot; are lining up... )&lt;/i&gt; Sometimes the audience is shouting out pre-ordained catcalls at the film and throwing objects like rice or toilet paper on cue. You can purchase a bag of ... er.. &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; to throw at the screen at the theater, or you can bring your own toast, extra toilet paper, flash lights, glow sticks, rice, or cards. According to their site, don't bring &amp;quot;Water Guns, Alcohol (this rule blows), Glass Bottles, Laser pointers&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How would you describe the experience that is Rocky Horror in all its lewd, trashy, silly, raunchy glory? Write your comments on the &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Talk about this Meetup&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; page.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price:&lt;/b&gt; $9.75 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's get in line to buy tickets at 11:30 pm on Saturday. It'll give us time to chat with each other before the show. Maybe we can try to take up a few rows close to each other. T.J. Maher will be dressed completely normal. T.J. is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... Who wants to meet up at 9:30 pm for dinner? SHeading to John Harvard's before. Who wants to come?

We simply circle around Church St. and the neighboring streets until we find a space that opens up.  This can take anywhere from 1 minute to 1 hour but it's taken more as a challenge.  (many people find spaces on Mass. Ave. as well) If you are not up to it (wuss), there is a pay-lot right on Church St., across from the Border Cafe.   There is also a parking garage in the Square, right off of JFK St. but you do NOT want to park there because it closes before the film gets out and your car will be stuck there all night long&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Church Street Parking Lot:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Church Street Parking Lot is on right side of street&amp;quot;/&lt;br /&gt;41 Church Street, &lt;br /&gt;Cambridge, MA 02138&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harvardsquare.com/Home/Services/The-Church-Street-Parking-Lot.aspx"&gt;http://www.harvardsqu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Night Rate:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5pm - 6am $8.00 each hour or fraction thereof: $16.00 max. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Credit cards accepted.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Midnight Horrors on Church Street,&amp;quot; Harvard Crimson, 4/11/2003: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=347506"&gt;http://www.thecrimson...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Once upon a time, a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, God said, ‘Let there be lips.’”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there were lips. Big, blood red lips and sparkling white teeth. Lips that begin mouthing the words to “Science Fiction/Double Feature,” the schmaltzy song that plays a little after midnight every Saturday at the Loews Harvard Square. The Rocky Horror Picture Show swaggers onto the screen, as it has every weekend for nearly two decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than one hundred fans crowd the cinema’s theater number four—from Rocky regulars who have the lines down pat and intone the “once upon a time” in unison, to first-timers there as Rocky “virgins.” Last Saturday, a Boston man decked out in a red sleeveless dress and fishnets sat across from a father escorting a dozen Spanish exchange students from his daughter’s high school and a New Jersey girl passing through town to visit colleges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two hours later, they will rush out of the back door onto a desolate Church Street, picking rice out of their hair and brushing after-dinner mints off their laps. The lucky ones might have given a lap dance on stage, bumped pelvises with perfect strangers as they danced the “Time Warp” in the aisles, or received an impromptu serenade from a man in lipstick and a miniskirt. They will have seen one of the greatest cult classics of all time, yelled at the screen and watched a seven-person cast act in sync with the movie’s leading players, strutting through the theater in black bras, garter belts, silk shirts tied high and skin-tight shiny pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, week after week, they will return to Rocky. Long after the horror has worn off, the picture is still playing and the show must go on.
