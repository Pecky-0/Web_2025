It has a trendy and hip decor with a tasty and diverse menu. They boast a Meatloaf Monday which includes their award winning meatloaf with a medley of sides and a glass of wine for $15.50. NOW on Mondays they also have $2.00 drafts, $5.00 sangrias, $.50 Blazin' hot Wings, pizza by the slice for $2.50 and $10.00 pitchers of beer! ALSO featuring Karaoke at 9:00pm with the fabulous Miss Sabrina Blaze (what IS she doing with those straws?)!  DownCity is a favorite with P-Collective members and I don't know about you, but Mondays seem to be getting a little wild over at DownCity and that can only mean one thing........Let's check it out! Sedately, of course.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing some kind of scarf - but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
