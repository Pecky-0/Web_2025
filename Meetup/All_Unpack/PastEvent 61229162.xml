&lt;p&gt;We're gonna do the whole path starting in Falmouth then going up the new section to North Falmouth and then back to the Peter Pan lot. Then on to Woods Hole and back to the lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire trip will be 22 miles but since we are starting in the middle of the path, if you want to be a litte less ambitious you can stop as we pass the Peter Pan lot on our way to Woods Hole. My guess is that leg is about half way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather is supposed to be perfect biking weather. partly cloudy and 60-65 degrees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Hope you can make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- R&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 12 year old daughter is coming with her friend. Kids are OK to come just make sure they can handle the distance. We aren't racers but not straight from the nursing home either.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for my very cool blue Toyota Sienna Mini Van (with the bike rack)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335192583000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334829600000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike Ride Shining Sea Bike Path</name><id>61229162</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335020400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/61229162/</event_url></item>
