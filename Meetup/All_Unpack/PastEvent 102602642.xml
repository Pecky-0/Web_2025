Reviewers say it's a disorienting thriller... Can't wait to see what we think of it! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Below is a description of the book from Amazon: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;In an unnamed city in an unnamed country, a man sitting in his car waiting for a traffic light to change is suddenly struck blind. But instead of being plunged into darkness, this man sees everything white, as if he "were caught in a mist or had fallen into a milky sea." A Good Samaritan offers to drive him home (and later steals his car); his wife takes him by taxi to a nearby eye clinic where they are ushered past other patients into the doctor's office. Within a day the man's wife, the taxi driver, the doctor and his patients, and the car thief have all succumbed to blindness. As the epidemic spreads, the government panics and begins quarantining victims in an abandoned mental asylum--guarded by soldiers with orders to shoot anyone who tries to escape. So begins Portuguese author José Saramago's gripping story of humanity under siege, written with a dearth of paragraphs, limited punctuation, and embedded dialogue minus either quotation marks or attribution. At first this may seem challenging, but the style actually contributes to the narrative's building tension, and to the reader's involvement.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;In this community of blind people there is still one set of functioning eyes: the doctor's wife has affected blindness in order to accompany her husband to the asylum. As the number of victims grows and the asylum becomes overcrowded, systems begin to break down: toilets back up, food deliveries become sporadic; there is no medical treatment for the sick and no proper way to bury the dead. Inevitably, social conventions begin to crumble as well, with one group of blind inmates taking control of the dwindling food supply and using it to exploit the others. Through it all, the doctor's wife does her best to protect her little band of blind charges, eventually leading them out of the hospital and back into the horribly changed landscape of the city.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Blindness &lt;em&gt;is in many ways a horrific novel, detailing as it does the total breakdown in society that follows upon this most unnatural disaster. Saramago takes his characters to the very edge of humanity and then pushes them over the precipice. His people learn to live in inexpressible filth, they commit acts of both unspeakable violence and amazing generosity that would have been unimaginable to them before the tragedy. The very structure of society itself alters to suit the circumstances as once-civilized, urban dwellers become ragged nomads traveling by touch from building to building in search of food.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The devil is in the details, and Saramago has imagined for us in all its devastation a hell where those who went blind in the streets can never find their homes again.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;And yet in the midst of all this horror Saramago has written passages of unsurpassed beauty. And in&lt;/em&gt; Blindness &lt;em&gt;he has written a profound, ultimately transcendent meditation on what it means to be human.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
