&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE! We've got about 35 people from all three groups.  I will organize people into teams of 6.  If you are late, you may not be able to get on a team, so please try to be prompt.  All are welcome to come and enjoy, even if you don't want to enter the competition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===============================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the FIRST ANNUAL "Great Pumpkin Carving Contest" at The North Star.  Brought to you in part by Absolut Vodka. Fun prizes, Fun games, and Booze!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Star will provide everything you need -- pumpkins, tools, etc.  You are welcome to bring anything additional you think you may need. Lucky scraper?  People will work in TEAMS OF UP TO 6 PEOPLE on a single pumpkin.  While you are busy carving, the staff will toast up your pumpkin seeds for you! Awww. Yum! Come early to organize a good team.  ;) BE CREATIVE! GO BANANAS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 21+ event and is NOT intended for families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Star is conveniently located near North Station (Orange Line, Green Line, and Commuter Rail), mere steps away from the TD Garden. The North Star is a fun, friendly sports bar that is host to several of the Red Sox Natives football viewing parties, as well as weekly TRIVINGO! Everyone is responsible for their own food and drink. PLEASE MAINTAIN A SEPARATE TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===============================&lt;/p&gt;
