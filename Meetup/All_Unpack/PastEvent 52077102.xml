Do you know? Get your situation out of your head and into receptive and kindly ears. Many of us have amazing insights into other people's situations that can be truly helpful. Meet with us in Marlborough to make some progress with your situation, with a little help from your fellow procrastinators and clutterers. As we chat, you might find that someone else's situation is similar to yours and you can learn by example. You might also find someone who can become a clutter buddy. Hope to see you this Thursday, Feb. 16th, at Panera Bread in Marlborough.
