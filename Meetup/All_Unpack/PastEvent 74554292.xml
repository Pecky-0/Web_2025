All attendees must read, understand and agree to the waiver/liability as outlined by this website. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will meet at the Moat Mtn Trailhead (south). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The trailhead is located on Dugway Rd. At the lights in Conway village, turn north (directly opposite NH 153) onto Washington St., which becomes West Side Rd. Go left at a fork, then at 0.9 mi. turn left on Passaconaway Rd., which becomes Dugway Rd. The Moat Mountain Trail (sign) leaves Dugway Rd. at a new trailhead parking area on the right, 4.1 mi. from Conway. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

We will spot cars here and carpool over to the Moat Mtn Trailhead (northeast). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Total distance is 9.5 miles &lt;br /&gt;

Book time is 6:30 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

starting at Moat Mtn Trailhead (northeast) 44° 04' 28" 71° 09' 51" &lt;br /&gt;

This trail traverses the main ridge of Moat Mountain, providing &lt;br /&gt;

magnificent views from numerous outlooks. The northeast &lt;br /&gt;

terminus of the trail is reached from Conway village via &lt;br /&gt;

Washington St. and West Side Rd., or from North Conway (at a &lt;br /&gt;

point just north of the Eastern Slope Inn) by following River Rd. &lt;br /&gt;

west for 1.0 mi. across the Saco River to West Side Rd. Once on &lt;br /&gt;

West Side Rd., drive north for another 1.4 mi. to a large parking &lt;br /&gt;

lot on the west side of the road. &lt;br /&gt;

0.57 mi 19 min +39 ft on Moat Mtn Trail &lt;br /&gt;

0.57 mi 19 min +39 ft This trail traverses the main ridge of Moat Mountain, providing &lt;br /&gt;

magnificent views from numerous outlooks. Parts of the ridge are &lt;br /&gt;

very exposed to weather, particularly the section that crosses &lt;br /&gt;

Middle Moat and South Moat. The trail can be hard to follow along &lt;br /&gt;

the open ridge sections in poor visibility conditions—look carefully &lt;br /&gt;

for blazes, which may be faded. &lt;br /&gt;

Starting from the northeast terminus, a wide, graded, &lt;br /&gt;

handicapped-accessible path descends slightly then turns left and &lt;br /&gt;

winds through coniferous woods, intersecting the former route (a &lt;br /&gt;

gravel road) at the clearing just below the mill site at Diana’s &lt;br /&gt;

Baths, a series of scenic cascades where Lucy Brook runs over &lt;br /&gt;

ledges and through large potholes. &lt;br /&gt;

to Dianas Baths 44° 04' 18" 71° 10' 12" &lt;br /&gt;

0.63 mi 25 min +153 ft on Moat Mtn Trail &lt;br /&gt;

1.20 mi 44 min +192 ft The Moat Mountain Trail leaves the upper end of the clearing, &lt;br /&gt;

close to the baths, by a logging road that follows the north bank of &lt;br /&gt;

Lucy Brook to a fork (sign). Here the Red Ridge Trail turns left &lt;br /&gt;

across the brook, eventually rejoining the Moat Mountain Trail at &lt;br /&gt;

the apex of Red Ridge, making possible a fine loop hike. &lt;br /&gt;

to the junction of Red Ridge Trail 44° 04' 03" 71° 10' 40" &lt;br /&gt;

1.20 mi 46 min +328 ft on Moat Mtn Trail &lt;br /&gt;

2.40 mi 1 hr 30 min +521 ft The Moat Mountain Trail crosses Lucy Brook (difficult at high &lt;br /&gt;

water), and follows the south bank, then turns abruptly left uphill, &lt;br /&gt;

away from the stream (last sure water), at the point where the &lt;br /&gt;

Attitash Trail continues straight ahead along the stream toward &lt;br /&gt;

Big Attitash Mountain. &lt;br /&gt;

to the junction of Attitash Trail 44° 03' 51" 71° 12' 01" &lt;br /&gt;

1.90 mi 2 hr 1 min +2125 ft on Moat Mtn Trail &lt;br /&gt;

4.30 mi 3 hr 31 min +2646 ft The Moat Mountain Trail ascends through the woods, and begins &lt;br /&gt;

to pass over ledgy areas, reaching the first good outlook. It &lt;br /&gt;

reaches a shoulder and runs nearly level through a patch of larger &lt;br /&gt;

trees, then climbs fairly steeply through decreasing scrub and &lt;br /&gt;

increasing bare ledge to the summit of North Moat, where there is &lt;br /&gt;

an unobstructed view in all directions. &lt;br /&gt;

to North Moat Mtn 44° 02' 35" 71° 12' 52" &lt;br /&gt;

1.10 mi 37 min -437 ft on Moat Mtn Trail &lt;br /&gt;

5.40 mi 4 hr 8 min +2209 ft From the summit of North Moat, the trail descends sharply to the &lt;br /&gt;

base of the cone, then easily along a shoulder with occasional &lt;br /&gt;

views. At the end of the shoulder it drops steeply, passing over &lt;br /&gt;

several ledges that require some scrambling, traverses another &lt;br /&gt;

shoulder where there is a fine outlook to the right in a ledgy area, &lt;br /&gt;

then descends to a col in a fine spruce forest. Ascending again, it &lt;br /&gt;

passes the junction with the Red Ridge Trail left (east), just below &lt;br /&gt;

several large rocks that provide good views. &lt;br /&gt;

to the junction of Red Ridge Trail 44° 02' 01" 71° 12' 16" &lt;br /&gt;

1.60 mi 1 hr 3 min +7 ft on Moat Mtn Trail &lt;br /&gt;

7.00 mi 5 hr 11 min +2216 ft The trail descends to the major col on the ridge, then climbs up to &lt;br /&gt;

low scrub followed by open ledges with continuous views, and &lt;br /&gt;

passes east of the summit of Middle Moat (which can be reached &lt;br /&gt;

in 80 yd. over open ledges). The trail descends to a minor col with &lt;br /&gt;

a patch of woods that would provide some shelter in a storm, then &lt;br /&gt;

ascends to the summit of South Moat. &lt;br /&gt;

to South Moat Mtn 44° 01' 03" 71° 11' 37" &lt;br /&gt;

9.50 mi 6 hr 30 min +118 ft The trail then descends into scrub and gradually increasing &lt;br /&gt;

numbers of beautiful red pines, with views decreasing in &lt;br /&gt;

frequency. The trail passes an outlook to Mt. Chocorua, and the &lt;br /&gt;

trail becomes steep with rough footing. Below this section, the &lt;br /&gt;

grade eases considerably, and then the trail turns right onto a &lt;br /&gt;

wide, well-constructed relocation. It runs generally west at easy &lt;br /&gt;

grades, crosses Dry Brook on a bridge, swings left and then right &lt;br /&gt;

over a small ridge, and crosses a small brook. It climbs over &lt;br /&gt;

another low ridge, then turns sharp left onto a logging road and &lt;br /&gt;

leads past a gate to the parking area on Passaconaway Rd. &lt;br /&gt;

to Moat Mtn Trailhead (south) 43° 59' 38" 71° 11' 01" &lt;br /&gt;

This trail traverses the main ridge of Moat Mountain, providing &lt;br /&gt;

magnificent views from numerous outlooks. The south terminus of &lt;br /&gt;

the trail is located on Dugway Rd. At the lights in Conway village, &lt;br /&gt;

turn north (directly opposite NH 153) onto Washington St., which &lt;br /&gt;

becomes West Side Rd. Go left at a fork, then at 0.9 mi. turn left &lt;br /&gt;

on Passaconaway Rd., which becomes Dugway Rd. The Moat &lt;br /&gt;

Mountain Trail (sign) leaves Dugway Rd. at a new trailhead &lt;br /&gt;

parking area on the right, 4.1 mi. from Conway. Dugway Rd. &lt;br /&gt;

continues and joins the Kancamagus Highway near Blackberry &lt;br /&gt;

Crossing Campground (but the west part of Dugway Rd. is closed &lt;br /&gt;

to vehicles from November to May). &lt;br /&gt;
