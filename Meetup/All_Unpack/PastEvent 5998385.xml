It looks as though the Wednesday activity will be better attended and more likely (I assume...) to produce cheers and positive interaction so let's leave that one on the books as our main event for the week. &lt;br /&gt;Thursday night can be just for those who want to do phone calling and letter writing or work on getting some local politicians to endorse our candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Let me know if this is a problem or if you have other agenda items to take up - it's your group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we can discuss the time if it's too early for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185219589000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184027927000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>planning, writing and phone list</name><id>5998385</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184882400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/5998385/</event_url></item>
