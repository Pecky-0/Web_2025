&lt;p&gt;We did this ride last year and had a great time.  &lt;br /&gt;

This ride is about 25 miles and runs through the nice towns of Lexington, Concord and Lincoln.  The Globe rates it as a top 10 Mass scenic ride&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long the ride will take us but we will try to keep roughly a 12 to 15 mile pace.  Will stop on occasion to make sure we try to travel as a group and will plan for a casual lunch in Concord along the way as well as a stop at the Old North Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexington Center has a public parking lot and plenty of free parking on side streets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to bring:  Helmet, Water, Sun Tan lotion, Money for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a ride for the super competitive as we do stop for everyone.  With that said we expect people to be able to ride 25 miles and be in reasonably good shape and to have good enough judgment to know if this is an appropriate ride for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No requirement for a road bike but probably not appropriate for a mountain bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will send out my contact info on Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also as a requirement for this ride I do ask that you have a face picture showing as I do want to be able to recognize everyone and keep track of us as a group&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet by the water fountain off the bike trail in Lexington Center</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary</member_name><member_id>10329460</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1344576746000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Bicyclists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bike-207</urlname><id>482869</id><group_lat>42.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Cycling/Outdoor Fitness Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343942515000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lexington Loop 25 Mile Ride</name><id>76074632</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344087000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bike-207/events/76074632/</event_url></item>
