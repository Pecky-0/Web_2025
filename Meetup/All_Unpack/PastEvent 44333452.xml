But there are still ways the grassroots volunteers can help in NH We the directors of the NH FTW PAC have agreed that since we didn't reach our goal for our first moneybomb, and in light of ...this super brochure controversy, we would hold one final online fundraiser to give the grassroots another opportunity to help. Therefore, you are hereby invited to participate in a mini bomb launching today, december 13, and running through tomorrow, December 14. I understand that this is inconvenient timing with the Tea Party mb so soon, but the money we are looking for should be a drop in the bucket. not to mention we're running out of time; contributions take a little hile to clear, and if we order something it will take time to ship I hope that you accept the invite and help us as we encourage new Hampshire voters to chose Ron Paul, for the win PLEASE CONSIDER DONATING HERE: &lt;a href="https://secure.piryx.com/donate/Hz2uoGvR/NH-FTW-PAC/" target="_blank"&gt;https://secure.piryx....&lt;/a&gt; OUR FB SITE: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/NH-FTW-PAC/298351370194463" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.facebook....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323876860000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1358</urlname><id>841263</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323800051000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FTW PAC's Minibomb for NH</name><id>44333452</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323871200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1358/events/44333452/</event_url></item>
