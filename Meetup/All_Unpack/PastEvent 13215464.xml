Danceable music that is likely going to result in a group of post show sweaty, exhausted, and happy people for certain!!! Check out the sound on his website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.elipaperboyreed.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.elipaperbo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;On 'Come And Get It' Reed proves to be the life and soul of a swinging, sweaty party in which everyone gets dragged onto the dance floor. As a performer, he approaches each song with nothing less than utter conviction; he's as authentically gritty as he is ingratiatingly sexy. Reed incorporates the feel of classic R&amp;amp;B, blues and soul into a largely self-penned, 12-song set, produced with Mike Elizondo&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;For me,&amp;quot; says Reed, &amp;quot;it's just about writing pop songs. Those are the kind of artists that I was influenced by and those influences are a big part of what I do. When I pick up a guitar to write a song, that's how it comes out. For me, that music has been completely internalized. I'm not trying to put anything on; this is what comes out, this is what happens, I can't sing any other way than I do.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $12. More pre meetup information will be released closer to the date of the show. Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jenn</member_name><member_id>10142965</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276292698000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271605012000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eli "Paperboy" Reed at Middle East Downstairs </name><id>13215464</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276214400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/13215464/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/4/9/global_14452169.jpeg</photo_url></item>
