Most of the songs will be new material freshly transcribed by their trumpeter Danny Fratina from the original 15-piece Benny Goodman Orchestra recordings of 1935-1938, with tempos between 150 and 190 bpm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie comes out in theaters one week later, on September 19. See them in the trailer at &lt;a href="http://www.mybestfriendsgirlmovie.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.mybestfriendsgirlmovie.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a beginner swing dance lesson from 8 to 9pm, and no partner or experience is required.  Since the followers (usually women) rotate through the leaders (usually men), the lesson is a great way to meet people before the music starts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band plays from 9:30 to 11:30pm, with DJ music during the breaks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's in Central Square in Cambridge, conveniently located right off the Red Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is $13 ($10 for students and seniors).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be directing the band.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223164512000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Swing Dancers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>swingdancing-110</urlname><id>549506</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston-Area Swing/Blues Dance Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219903808000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swing Dance in Central Square, Cambridge</name><id>8638424</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221264000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/swingdancing-110/events/8638424/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/e/global_5318046.jpeg</photo_url></item>
