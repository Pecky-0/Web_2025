The past two years we had so much fun! There were 28 people here last year and all came up with amazing pumpkin designs and brought a delicious and plentiful spread of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for an evening of carving, food and fun. We'll set up carving (or painting, if you wish) stations. During the evening we plan to toast the pumpkin seeds, enjoy spiced &amp;amp; spiked cider, and enjoy food and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring Your Own: - pumpkin - carving knife - food to share Time: 5:30 pm - whenever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place: Our home in West Roxbury (bordering Brookline and Jamaica Plain). ***Note: I will provide the exact address and my phone number to those who RSVP.***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to get here from all over Boston - we're inside the 128 corridor. Also great for those in Boston not wanting to drive - we're just 1 block from the Commuter Rail Bellevue Station (13 minutes from Back Bay, 17 minutes from South Station). &amp;nbsp;Want to take the Commuter Rail? Take the Needham Line to Bellevue Station. A train arrives here at 5:27pm which will get you here just in time. There are trains back to the city at 8:18 and 10:18. Hope to see you all there! -Stacy and Ingi&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stacy Goodman</member_name><member_id>3216337</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1320103482000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317520262000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>3rd Annual Pumpking Carving and Potluck</name><id>35770992</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319923800000</time><rsvp_limit>46</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/35770992/</event_url></item>
