His wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him, his jobless brother (Richard Kind) has moved in, and someone is trying to sabotage his chances for tenure. Larry seeks advice from three different rabbis, but whether anyone can help him overcome his many afflictions remains to be seen. &lt;br /&gt;Cast: Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Kind, Fred Melamed, Sari Lennick, Adam Arkin &lt;br /&gt;Director: Ethan Coen &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Serious Man is not exactly a happy story, but one of the things that makes it as involving as it is is the formidible filmmaking skill the Coens have honed in more than 25 years of collaboration.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt; - Kenneth Turan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...a wonderfully odd, bleakly comic and thoroughly engrossing film.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;USA Today&lt;br /&gt; - Claudia Puig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A Serious Man is the kind of picture you get to make after you've won an Oscar.
