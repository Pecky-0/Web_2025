Bring your experiences from the Thanksgiving weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We expressively welcome anybody who lived for a while in a German speaking country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you on Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not forget to RSVP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaj&lt;br /&gt;Your humble organizer&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Jacob Wirth is a German Restaurant in the theater district of Boston, that serves German favorites such as Bratwurst and Sauerkraut or Wiener Schnitzel. They also have Paulaner Hefeweizen and other German beer.&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S.: There is parking right next to the restaurant, which is $15 deposit, which is refunded if you return in less than 2 hours with a stamp from Jacob Wirth.
