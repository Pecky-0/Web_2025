If you have a macro lens this is a great venue for it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Property Description:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;114 acres | Established 1979&lt;br /&gt;From 1916 to 1979, &lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/314_long_hill.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;Long Hill&lt;/a&gt; was the summer home of noted author and editor of The Atlantic Monthly, Ellery Sedgwick, and his first wife, Mabel Cabot Sedgwick, an accomplished horticulturist, gardener, and author of The Garden Month by Month. The Federal-style house was completed in 1925 and contains original woodwork from the ca.1812 Isaac Ball House in Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Sedgwick designed and planted the original gardens. After her death in 1937, Mr. Sedgwick's second wife, the former Marjorie Russell, herself a distinguished gardener and propagator of rare plants, added many plants to the gardens, including unusual species and varieties of trees and shrubs, some introduced by the Arnold Arboretum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today the gardens reflect the collective interests and tastes of both women. Five acres of cultivated grounds are laid out in a series of separate garden &amp;quot;rooms&amp;quot; surrounding the house. Each area is distinct in its own way and is accented by garden ornaments, structures, and statuary. The gardens are flanked on all sides by more than 100 acres of woodland as well as an apple orchard, meadow, and agricultural fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Fee:&lt;/b&gt; $1 Money collected from event fees goes directly to paying for and supporting the group meetup.com website.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>5251554</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278017390000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273176318000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Long Hill/Sedgewick Gardens</name><id>13406584</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276441200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/13406584/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/9/global_14869673.jpeg</photo_url></item>
