Max has graciously invited us to share in a Solstice potluck and bonfire on Saturday, December 22nd at his family's farm in Falmouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potluck dinner indoors around 6:30 and then outside for the bonfire around 7:30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget your potluck gear (dish/utensils/napkin/cup).  &lt;br /&gt;PLUS:  Bring one or more non-perishable food items for a big group donation box to one of the local food banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear warm clothes and boots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potluck Breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;Last Name A-G Main Dish&lt;br /&gt;Last Name H-N Side Dish or Bread&lt;br /&gt;Last Name O-S Dessert&lt;br /&gt;Last Name T-Z Beverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Heading North from Portland we are 2 miles from Hannaford and exit 53 on 95 on the right.  There is a sign saying Winslow Farm, but it is just past the driveway, look for a large green farm stand and large glass greenhouse on the side our driveway just to the right of the greenhouse.  We live in the large barn in the back.  Parking can happen in the drive or in front of the farm stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optional:  Write down a private intention/wish/hope for 2008 which will go into the bonfire before the night is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198676257000</updated><rating><average>4.63000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197464283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Solstice Bonfire at Max' House (Winslow Farm)</name><id>6899929</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198366200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/6899929/</event_url></item>
