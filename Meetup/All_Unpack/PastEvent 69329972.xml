Since the Harvard Loews will be closed by opening night, RIP!, I'm moving the event to the new go-to-theatre, the Boston Commons Loews.  I also realized today that the date I picked was the same as the picnic, so I'm changing that too.  Hopefully people can still come.  Otherwise, feel free to fling things at me at the monthly meeting tomorrow :) &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Let's plan to meet for dinner at Silvertone (&lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/silvertone-boston#query:downtown%20crossing%20restaurants" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/biz/silvertone-boston#query:downtown%20crossing%20restaurants&lt;/a&gt;) at 5:30.  Post movie, we can try that cute little cafe again :)  Though, the movie clock in at 2h45, so we may be comatose by then end...&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll either be standing outside the restaurant at 5:15 or outside the theatre at 7:15.  Hard to miss me...maybe I'l wear something crazy.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah</member_name><member_id>16789791</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342997384000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339783078000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Dark Knight Rises (7:00pm/7:30pm @ Boston Common Loews)</name><id>69329972</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342827000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/69329972/</event_url></item>
