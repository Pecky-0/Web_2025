Includes Indigo Road by Tomoyasu Murata, Scrap Land by Dino Sato, Bio City by Yoshihisa Nakanishi, Tough Guy by Shinatro Kishimoto, desktop by Yoshinao Satoh, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide more information about the shorts and their directors if I find out anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I (Nicole) will be holding up a meetup sign and we'll head off to the museum cafe, where we will eat concoctions supposedly come up with by Wolfgang Puck, catch a beautiful view of the water and discuss what we saw.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191863105000</updated><rating><average>3.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190565504000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Independent Animation from Japan: Animated Short Films</name><id>6412895</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191690000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6412895/</event_url></item>
