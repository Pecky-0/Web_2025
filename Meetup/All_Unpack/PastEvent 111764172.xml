Join Amy Wilmot, a DCR interpreter and myself on a moderate 5-mile hike in F. Gilbert Hills State Park. This park, 1027 acres in size, is heavily wooded, comprising mostly oak and white pine forests. &lt;br /&gt;

This scenic park is full of large glacial boulders and also has a number of unusual rock formations believed to be ancient indian rock constructions "the stones sites " throughout. We will visit one the most unusual of these sites. &lt;br /&gt;

This hike have about 400 feet of elevation gain over the first 2 1/2 miles as we will walk up to High Rock, the highest elevation between Boston and Providence where we will stop for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will share some interesting information and discuss unique features that this park has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
