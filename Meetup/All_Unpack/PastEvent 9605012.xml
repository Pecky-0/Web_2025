Traditionally, this was believed to be the day when the birds would begin to sing again. In medieval calendars, this was a day of love, when all nature found a mate. In Modern times we look forward to the coming season, and pray that all our hopes and plans will be &amp;quot;fertile&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class 6PM: Urban Shamanism&lt;br /&gt;Part of the most-requested class we have given, this class is sometimes called an Owner's Manual for human existence. It utilizes the most recent findings in Physics, Psychology and other Sciences to prove and utililize what Earth-Centered Religions have kbnown for years.  Focusing on the pragmatic, it explores the relationship between the Heart, the Mind and the Spirit, how they work, how they work with each other, and how you can make them work for you. Attendees have often left commenting how this information makes so much sense it should be self-evident, however they never heard it presented in such a manner.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Back of Church, upstairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235940928000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232996193000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - Lupercalia </name><id>9605012</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234738800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9605012/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
