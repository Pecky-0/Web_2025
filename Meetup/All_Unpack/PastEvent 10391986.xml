As a result, we will hit up New Haven tonight since the traffic issue won't affect anyone (other than the guys coming from south of Milford, which I don't think we have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright boys, going to switch this Friday night up a little bit. &lt;br /&gt;Let's meet up at Southport Brewing Company, a.k.a. SBC, in Milford on Friday night, May 22nd at 10:00. This place fills up quick with tons of people and is within walking distance of tons of other good spots to bounce to.&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - To Sr. members, I (JC) am unavailable to get there earlier for a pre-meetup. If any of the Sr. guys would like to arrange to be there earlier, we can make the meetup start earlier in the night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that at the end of the month, non-participating memebers will be given notice that they may be deleted from the Connecticut Wingmen. Please make sure to RSVP to ensure this does not happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Know me from my pic or call me.
