Bring dinner, bug spray, and a bathing suit if you want to swim in the pond or a kayak if you want to paddle after the event (not part of the offical event).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a narrow woodland trail being somewhat rocky with snaking roots in parts and rolling terrain, so any children really should be physically fit and over the age of 7 years. There is one tricky detour near a dam, which people could miss. We also pass through the public beach area about 3/4 of the way to the end of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burr Pond State Park offers hiking, Bathrooms, Boat Launch, Food Concessions, Picnic Shelter, Picnic Tables, swimming, canoe/kayak rentals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at 2 PM at the north parking lot off of Burr Mountain Rd. (at the boat launch -see the map). We believe the north lot is still free to park at. To get to the main east lot there is a $7 CT resident/$10 non-resident per car entrance fee to the park. Carpooling is encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, please contact the event leader John H (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2694462/)"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Do NOT make any payment via Paypal!
