Throughout the evening their lounges are piled high with giveaways, contests, flavorful specials and lots of fun and excitement. Even better, 5% of the evening's gross lounge sales are donated to a local charity. Area businesses, organizations and distributors get in on the fun by supplying fantastic prizes and throughout the night. You could win anything and everythingâ€”t-shirts, gift certificates, ski passes, skydiving and rafting trips, snowboards and more! You have to see it to believe it. Join Margaritas for their next Full Moon Margarita Madness and see what all the excitement is about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restaurant Meetup Policy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please remember, RSVP yes only if you plan to attend to allow us to make reservations.
