He leaves behind his 11 year old brother, Cameron. His death was unexpected. Although, we have not received the autopsy report, he was exhibiting asthmatic symptoms on the day of his death. This road race, will not only sustain his memory, but increase asthma awareness and fund asthma research. The following organizations are helping me with this road race, American Lung Association (Northeast) located in East Hartford, CT) Waterbury and Naugatuck YMCA, Troop 138 (Boyscouts) and the Naugatuck, CT. Please come out and be a part of this race by participating in one of the following, running, walking, volunteering or being present. It would mean a lot to me and my family. It would mean a lot to Michael's brother, Cameron. We hope to have a great showing on the day of Michael's first memorial run, here in Naugatuck. The race will be held in the afternoon, registration at 12:00 or previously through the American Lung Association Northeast website (site is not up as of present). The site should be up soon...I will keep you posted. The race will start at 1:00 pm. I hope to see you there, we hope to see you there...Norlean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update, the website is up: Please go to &lt;a href="http://www.lungne"&gt;www.lungne&lt;/a&gt;. org and click on events or see all events. You'll see Michael's race. As you are registering it asks for a donation. It is your choice, you can either go with it, or 0.00 it out, or do a smaller or greater amount. I hope to see you at the race line and thank you for all of your support.&amp;nbsp; Norlean :)&lt;/p&gt;
