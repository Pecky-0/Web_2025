<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;After a long hiatus, it's time for the occasional meetups at Don's place to resume!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to host again! Tonight we're going to play a game that's been a favorite of mine for a long time, and that I bet most of you have never played: Acquire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquire&amp;nbsp;is an&amp;nbsp;American game from the 1960s, but it's remarkably like a Euro. I think you're gonna love it if you give it a chance. Here's a link to its entry on Boardgamegeek.com if you wanna read about it: &lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire"&gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 6 can play, so I'm limiting RSVPs to that number. Each member can invite no more than 1 guest. I'll provide a few snacks (please don't expect anything even remotely similar to Margaret's!). Please BYOB, a snack to share, if you wish, and $1 for our wonderful organizer Nina. If you already know how to play Acquire, feel free to come at 6:30. Otherwise, please plan to show up on time (at 6:00) so I can go over the rules just once. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to see (some of!) you at my new place soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326640527000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1324262704000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Acquire at Don's New Place</name><id>44867322</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326582000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-CardBoard-Players-Club/events/44867322/</event_url></item>
