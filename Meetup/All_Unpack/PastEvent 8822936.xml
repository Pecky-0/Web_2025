Looks unusual and fascinating........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Artist Adel Abdessemed refuses to be limited to a single ideology or medium—he works across video, animation, performance, and sculptural installation. He passionately tackled religious, sexual and hallucinogenic taboos subjects in his early works and his later exhibitions have often focused on the theme of global violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some consider his work to be performative, Abdessemed aggressively rejects this terminology, preferring simply to call his works “acts,” recognizing the term’s political implications. In an interview with Elisabeth Lebovici he stated, “I do not live between two cultures. I am not a post-colonial artist. I am not working on the scar and am not mending anything. I am just a detector…. In the public sphere, I use passion and rage. Nothing else, I don’t do illusions.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Paris, Abdessemed extended his Rue Lemercier studio by appropriating that street and its neighboring market areas. There, working with a professional animal trainer, he has filmed a series of astonishing photographs of African wildlife loose on a Paris street (seven wild boars, a lion, and a snake); his mother carrying him like a small child; and his Paris dealer portrayed as a pickpocket.(1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the artist, visit &lt;a href="http://listart.mit.edu/node/438" target="_blank"&gt;http://listart.mit.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a purple flower pin.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cristin</member_name><member_id>603739</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224195355000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222264311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adel Abdessemed: Situation And Practice--Opening Reception</name><id>8822936</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223676000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/8822936/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/9/8/global_5632760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
