&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They are calling for Temps around 60 for Saturday, so why not go for a Bike Ride. &amp;nbsp;We all had a Great Time last Weekend, so why waste this Nice Weather. &amp;nbsp;I chose this path because it is inland, away from chilly Sea Breezes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The total ride is 16 miles. &amp;nbsp;It offers nice scenery and water views, complete with waterfalls. It is an interesting path, in that you are riding slightly uphill all the way out. &amp;nbsp;It is not much, but you will notice you get back Quicker and easier. &amp;nbsp;If there is time left, those who want, can head toward Cranston. &amp;nbsp;Not sure how far we will get. &amp;nbsp;The entire path is actually 32 miles round trip, but I like to start in the middle so no one feels pressured to ride more than they are comfortable with. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the end of the path, there is an unpaved section of about 2 miles, if anyone wants to do some off roading. &amp;nbsp;A couple of us went off road back in April. &amp;nbsp;I will leave that up to you. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Directions: Route 295 South to exit #2, Route 2 South. Take a Right at the Light with the Dunkin Doughnuts and the Parking Lot is , 1/4 mile down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 or Route 95 South to exit 12B, the exit splits stay LEFT Route 113 West. 1/2 Mile you will see the Dunkin Doughnuts, keep going straight thru the Light. The Parking Lot is 1/4 mile Down on your Left, just as you cross the Bike Path. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming 95 North, get on Route 295 North and take I believe the first exit. It is either Route 2 South or Route 113 West. &amp;nbsp;All I know is that there is no Exit 12 on Route 95 heading North and you need to take Route 295 North. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 For those who do not know how to Follow directions or Read a Map, LOL, Enter 700 East Ave Warwick R I in your GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
