It's that time of year again! Boston Frisbee presents our annual Halloween game on Boston Common. Don't miss out, it will be a fantastic time. Where else can you dress up and play a fantastic, fun, all inclusive game of Frisbee?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The festivities begin on Sunday Oct 31 at 1 PM at our usual spot in Boston Common. For three hours we will toss around, eat candy, admire costumes, play wacky games, and play Frisbee!! In capes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go out for a social afterward, and if there is interest, will be returning to Boston Common for some illuminated frisbee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COSTUMES&lt;/b&gt;: YES, wear costumes! It wouldn't be Halloween Frisbee without us running around in silly outfits. To get an idea of how fun this is, here are the pictures from last year's event:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/photos/754498/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the pictures, you don't HAVE to dress up to come to this event. But don't the dressed up people look like they are having way more fun? Also, there will be prizes for the best costumes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CRAZY GAMES&lt;/b&gt;: We'll be mixing things up by making up crazy rules every once in awhile. In the past this has ranged from everyone running backwards to people having super powers (like making other players freeze and rewinding mistakes). Who knows what we will come up with this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come prepared for fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Organizers&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>461418</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert</member_name><member_id>4002514</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Baz</member_name><member_id>4845259</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sidd</member_name><member_id>5010126</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tayeb Al Karim</member_name><member_id>5634753</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Oliver K</member_name><member_id>6144635</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cara</member_name><member_id>7321267</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>robb</member_name><member_id>11053577</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288627521000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285861220000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Freaky Frisbee Halloween Extravaganza 2010</name><id>14951114</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288544400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/14951114/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/f/d/global_6094861.jpeg</photo_url></item>
