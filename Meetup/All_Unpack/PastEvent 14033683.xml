Is it that we don’t have a poem in our heads or that we do, but can’t translate it into words? Or is it bigger than that? Are we actually afraid of writing a poem? If so, why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this workshop we will explore many of the reasons why we stop short from writing that great poem locked inside us. We will break through those barriers allowing us to write without fear. Then we will start from the beginning, from how to come up with an idea, or how to work with an existing idea to create that inspirational poem you will be proud to have others read. We will explore how to convert those abstract emotions into palpable images and how to use poetic devices such as metaphor and alliteration to enhance the poetic experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t let the fear of writing keep you from creating that masterpiece inside you.
