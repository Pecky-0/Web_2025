Life pulls us in many directions, and with all the demands upon us, it is more important than ever to have a place where we can call center. Unless we are aware of our thoughts and moods, and how we interact with the world, we are folly to the winds and storms of life. With the cultivation of discipline, we can begin to establish a practice that is consistent and powerful, creating a centered presence that we bring to everything we do. This week we will have several short meditations, and talk about what it takes to create the discipline needed to create and sustain a daily mindfulness practice. Please come join us in spiritual community as we meditate together and discuss the challenges and potential of discipline.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245097228000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241478918000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup: Discipline</name><id>10337734</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244500200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/10337734/</event_url></item>
