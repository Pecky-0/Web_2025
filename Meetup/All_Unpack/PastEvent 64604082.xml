&lt;p&gt;Following the screening, director Robert &lt;span&gt;Thalheim&lt;/span&gt; will be available for a Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Westwind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungary, 1988 - before the fall of the Berlin Wall. 17-year-old twins Doreen and Isabel are successful oarswomen who travel from their rural Saxony in East Germany to a Hungarian summer training camp on Lake Balaton. They hope this summer training will help them get accepted into a renowned boarding school for athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their journey to the camp, however, Doreen falls in love with Arne, a West German boy from Hamburg. The twins, having grown up knowing what each is thinking, begin to separate. Will this spell disaster for their rowing ambitions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Robert Thalheim has studied at numerous universities in Germany and the United States. He publishes the cultural periodical Plotzki, has written a book on Polish director Andrzej Wajda and directs his own work for theater. His films include &lt;span&gt;Netto&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;And Along Came Tourists&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In German with English subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Q&amp;amp;A we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa&lt;/p&gt;
