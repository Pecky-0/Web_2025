&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurants and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Whiskey Republic, 515 S. Water St. (this is the area with a few bars across from Narragansett Electric and in front of the hurricane barrier on the water and next to Lola's Cantina)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's supposed to be nice and a balmy 60 degrees on Monday, so why not spend a little time on the water enjoying the weather! Get there early and enjoy the sun and sunset from the deck before it goes down and it gets chilly again. Inside or outside, the view is sure to be good! Many of us have been here before, but if you haven't yet, here's your chance, so let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not the Hot Club? Because we save that tradition for Memorial Day!!! Not to worry though, there will be lots of time for that! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So come down and hang out with friends for fun and good cheer this Monday (while it's warm) at Whiskey Republic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. Except Hurricane Sandy or NYE 2012!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a scarf or the black hat in my picture, but we're not hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
