&lt;p&gt;Designing for Urban Agriculture: What is the place of food in the city?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are "waste" spaces being transformed by food projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the implications on materials, technologies and structures? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Carrot City is a traveling exhibit that shows how the design of buildings and cities  can enable the production of food in the city. (For example - our very own Gracie's Restaurant has a rooftop garden on the Peerless Building&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt; It explores the relationships between  design and urban food systems as well as the impact that agricultural issues have  on the design of urban spaces and buildings. The exhibit explores these issues at  four different scales, the city scale, the community scale,home and work and the products that make all of this possible Carrot City will be exhibited at the AIA/RI Gallery in Providence, Rhode Island Date of Exhibition: Friday, February 25, 2011 - Friday, March 11, 2011 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Location: AIA/RI gallery, 158 Washington Street, Providence, RI &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Grand Opening: Friday, February 25, beginning at 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;
