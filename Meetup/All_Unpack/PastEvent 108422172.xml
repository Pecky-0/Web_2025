&lt;p&gt;Well, you certainly won't have trouble finding this book! The poll this month was a clear winner again! With 43% of the votes, Dune by Frank Herbert was your pick for the book club!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family--and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones and across the street from Orleans restaurant. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
