Terrific Tuesday Vegan Dinner hosted by Reverence for Life &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;

On Tuesday, March 26 at 6 pm, Reverence for Life will host a Vegan POTLUCK Terrific Tuesday Dinner at First Parish in Concord.  &lt;br /&gt;

All are welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last dinner had over 100 guests and the food was fabulous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

You don’t have to be vegan or vegetarian to join the fun.   However, we ask that you bring a dish that is meat, poultry, fish, dairy (milk and cheese) and egg free so that everyone can sample every dish!  If you don't like to cook or don't have a recipe just bring a salad or some crusty bread.  There will be plenty of food for all!  Bring your own wine, beer or beverage.  &lt;br /&gt;

***We also ask that you bring your own plate, silverware and napkins and glasses to reduce paper waste and cleanup.  We will have paper if you forget!  &lt;br /&gt;

Children are always welcome and we will have an activity to entertain them!  &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;

We are extremely fortunate to have UU minister Rev. Gary Kowalski and his wife Dori as our guests for the evening.  Gary has written several books and will draw from his new book Blessing of the Animals: Celebrating our Kinship with All Creation and lead our Vespers service following dinner.   Our amazing First Parish songwriter Anna Huckabee Tull will also be joining us to sing her composition “Dare to Rise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food was incredible at our last dinner and we’d love to develop a cookbook of all the wonderful recipes.  If you would like to share yours, please bring a copy of your recipe including your name and the name of any cookbook that you used. &lt;/p&gt;
