And just in time for Christmas, we have some sweet gifts from Nutro!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when &lt;a href="http://www.thenutrocompany.com/index.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nutro&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sponsored our group for August, September &amp;amp; October? They took care of our meetup dues, we hosted a fun little Halloween party, they sent a Nutro person to one of our meetups to talk about their food, and they actually put all the frenchies that RSVP'd to that meetup into a raffle to win a year's worth of Nutro dog food. Well, TATER WON the raffle! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutro also just sent a whole lotta food to Clyde's house and we're bringing it to this meetup to share. There will be cute Nutro gift bags with Natural Choice Small Breed Adult food and really cool looking carabiner poo bag holders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetup dues are $3 per frenchie...this covers the $12 monthly fee to host our meetup.com group online. Anything received in excess of the $12 will be donated to the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/" target="_blank"&gt;French Bulldog Rescue Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in the group's name. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much, we can't wait to see you for a little holiday fun!
