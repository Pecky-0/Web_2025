Want to cross-promote your events and campaigns over a couple of cocktails? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unwind with SoJust at Peking Tom's in Downtown Crossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No program. No speaker. Just arrive and enjoy yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.livingroot.org/PhotoGallery/albums/userpics/10001/thumb_PICT0380.JPG" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP yes, maybe or no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________&lt;br /&gt;Socializing for Justice (SoJust) is for FEMINISTS, ANTI-RACISTS, QUEER PIONEERS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS, CLASS ACTIVISTS, GENDERBENDERS, ARTISTS,  and all people across Greater Boston working for justice. But it's not work! Instead, we're building a strong cross-issue network through fun social events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At SoJust events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social.  And the best part is that SoJust members share your vision of building a more just world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robbie Samuels</member_name><member_id>3091753</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>21</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179261849000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>SoJusters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sojust-tm</urlname><id>299655</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Socializing for Justice</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>49</yes_rsvp_count><created>1175805412000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cocktails for Justice</name><id>5641739</id><headcount>62</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178748000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sojust-tm/events/5641739/</event_url></item>
