Join us for this beautiful ceremony. Inscribe your own words of remembrance and hope on the shades of simple wooden lanterns, and then release them, glimmering with candlelight, onto Lake Hibiscus at dusk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people attend with friends and family, spreading out a blanket for a picnic dinner, and then working on commemorative lanterns. The evening starts with performances of drumming, dance, and choral music. Hear the dynamic Master Tsuji's Samurai Taiko Drummers and spirited music by Ron Murphy and Friends, some of Boston's finest gospel singers. Enjoy traditional Japanese Bon Festival dances presented in elegant kimona clad students from Showa Boston Institute and traditional Chinese folk dance by youth from Chu Ling Dance Academy. The haunting sounds of Japanese flute, followed by Scottish bagpipes, accompany the lanterns on their journey across the Lake &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: bring a flashlight to help guide your exit from the Cemetery, as there is no electrical lighting after dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foresthill.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.foresthill...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: The date for this event according the Forest Hill is 99% accurate. This event usually takes place on the 2nd thursday in July but for whatever reason this year they have moved it to the 3rd thursday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a $5.00 parking fee. The event is free, however, lanterns are $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>33</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219152185000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205633535000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Forest Hill Cemetary - Lantern Festival</name><id>7541737</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216328400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/7541737/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/1/d/global_3494589.jpeg</photo_url></item>
