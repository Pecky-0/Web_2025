How would you know if you are at a place in your life where it's time to take a teacher? What does it mean to be ready for that relationship? Come and discover how the student:teacher relationship is meant to work and how to find a teacher if you're ready for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God; for over 20 years, he has served as a Priest and Master Teacher. Currently, he serves as Co-Director of the Order of Christ/Sophia, teaching and ministering to his spiritual students, and guiding fifteen Centers of Light and their ministers around the country. He travels between these Centers year-round, teaching and lecturing, as well as performing his music as a singer-songwriter of Mystical Christian folk rock. Many of the elements of the Mystical Christian teachings can be heard and experienced in Father Peter's music, encouraging the listener to seek and discover the Truth within. Listen to his music on Sophia Radio. When not traveling, Father Peter lives at the Center of Light in Chicago, IL.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Located just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the orange line.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236040844000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-684</urlname><id>1246909</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Meditation Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229625751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Workshop:  Who's Ready To Be A Student</name><id>9359135</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234018800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-684/events/9359135/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/3/0/global_6658400.jpeg</photo_url></item>
