While Rebecca has dreams of working for a top fashion magazine, she can't quite get her foot in the door-that is, until she snags a job as an advice columnist for a new financial magazine published by the same company. Overnight, her column becomes hugely popular, turning her into an overnight celebrity. But when her compulsive shopping and growing debt issues threaten to destroy her love life and derail her career, she struggles to keep it all from spiraling out of control--and is ultimately forced to reevaluate what's really important in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Isla Fisher, Hugh Dancy, Krysten Ritter, Joan Cusack, John Goodman&lt;br /&gt;Genres: Comedy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;NOTE:&lt;/span&gt; If any of you ladies would prefer to see a different movie for yourself, I'll bring a movie list with show times to Not Your Average Joe's, or you can look it up on the internet at: &lt;a href="http://www.fandango.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: If you want to just make the lite bites at TGI Fridays and not attend a movie that's fine too!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a button that says, "Girl's Just Wanna Have Fun!"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharon</member_name><member_id>8235187</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236381199000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
