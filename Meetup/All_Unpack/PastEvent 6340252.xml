Everyone enjoyed each other, even one of us couldn't speak any Chinese at all.  The rule was anything spoken in Chinese need to be repeated in English, so no one was left out ! Of course, once we get the conversation going, everything else will fall in place eventually ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Edwin &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Edwin E Ouyang</member_name><member_id>4127989</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192144267000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mandarin Chinese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>help2learnchinese</urlname><id>490150</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Help2LearnChinese Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189555869000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Help2LearnChinese October Meetup</name><id>6340252</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191970800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/help2learnchinese/events/6340252/</event_url></item>
