 &lt;br /&gt; Join us on Sunday, July 10, from 9:30 a.m. until 11 AM for a walk on a paved walking/jogging trail in Woodbridge followed by optional lunch. Fitzgerald Trails is located at 100 Center Road in Woodbridge, Connecticut, and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of parking at the Woodbridge Town Library at 10 Newton Road. If you stand in front of the library with the entrance behind you, in front of you will be the main parking lot and across the street you will see a white building with green trim. Walk to the street (which is Center Road) and cross to the other side of the street where the white building is. Turn left and walk about 50 yards.The walking trail will be on your right. We will meet on the walking trail adjacent to Center Road. If you arrive after 9:30 a.m., just wait at this location and you will see us in a few minutes as we walk around the track.
