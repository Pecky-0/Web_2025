<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's time to let your dog burn off all that summer time energy! Please join us in our large, fenced-in, play yard and allow your dog to run around safely and socialze with other friendly dogs. We will be having the group outside unless there is bad wheather and then we would hold the group inside in our large indoor play room. We will fill the kiddy pools for the dogs who like the water. If you would like to see anything else during this meet up, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I will put out some beverages and some food to munch on. Also, If you would like your dog groomed after them meet up let me know and we can schedule an appointment with 25% off.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253984550000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Boston-Active-Small-Dog-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1444277</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Small Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247940435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Small Dog Gathering in August</name><id>10904545</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250355600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Greater-Boston-Active-Small-Dog-Meetup-Group/events/10904545/</event_url></item>
