It is NOT a vegan restaurant but is vegan/vegetarian friendly. They also said that you can check out the menu online (the night before) and if you know what you would like to order you can email me and I can call them before we get there and they would have it ready for us when we arrive! (that's pretty nice of them) They usually close at 3, but they are having a function this Saturday so they are closing at 2. When we are done eating we could walk up Main Street and have a drink or two at Martha's Exchange. This is a microbrewery and Tracy has heard great things about them! Thank Tracy for the idea...she is always full of them! I am sorry for such short notice, but I did not get any input for ideas for the next meeting. Please if you have any ideas just let me know! I look forward to seeing all of you there!!! I also would like to welcome the new members!! It is nice to see new faces and I hope you will be able to make it to our meeting :) If anyone needs a ride, I am sure we could figure out something. I hope all is well with you all wish you a lovely Easter :)  If you need to get a hold of me for whatever reason 603.391.5027&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ruth.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a grey t-shirt that says "Vegan" :)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365646527000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239387277000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Meetup!</name><id>10159679</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240675200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/10159679/</event_url></item>
