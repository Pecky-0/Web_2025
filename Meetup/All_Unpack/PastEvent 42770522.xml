&lt;p&gt;The course is a 5k (or ~3.1mi) around downtown New Haven, starting and ending at Christopher Martin's.&amp;nbsp; Entry fee is $15, or $5 with the donation of a Toy.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is responsible for their own sign up and entry, you can sign up at &lt;a href="http://www.jbsports.com/"&gt;http://www.jbsports.com/&lt;/a&gt; or at "Trailblazer" stores in Downtown New Haven and Branford. Sign up early if you can, as this race often sells out and many times has little to no availability on Race-Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Martin's also puts on a Great Post Race Party in their parking lot including Food and Beer for the Runners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't all have to run together due to pacing reasons, but feel free to use the Meetup comments and mail to coordinate if you want race buddies.&amp;nbsp; See you at the finish line and beer/grub tent!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : line-through"&gt;Special thanks to Miguel for hosting this Meetup!&amp;nbsp; He will post additional contact info soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unless Miguel suddenly has a spurt of luck to come after all, I (A.J.) will take over as host in his place.&amp;nbsp; The "Meeting Up" part is predominantly at the after party though I.M.O. and if you have trouble finding me there you can give me a text or ring at 315-345-9348.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
