<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Anne Fadiman is giving a talk about her writing, the writing process, and editing.  She is most know for her 1997 book The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. Researched in California, it examined a generational Hmong family with a child with epilepsy, and their cultural, linguistic and medical struggles in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a really great book and I thought it would be interesting to hear her speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is open to the public and completely free, but we do need ot RSVP for tickets beginning on April 23.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been looking for an opportunity to listen to a published writer speak and this seems like a great opportunity.  And then of course we can followi it up with some Cinco de Mayo celebrations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>out front</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>alexa</member_name><member_id>3237755</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242172971000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Writers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>bostonwriters</urlname><id>1300976</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Writers' Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238005712000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>One Writerâ€™s Life: Anne Fadiman on Reading, Writing, and Editing.</name><id>10033920</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241560800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonwriters/events/10033920/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/3/global_5878579.jpeg</photo_url></item>
