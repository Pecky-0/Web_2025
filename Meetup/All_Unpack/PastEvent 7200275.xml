Over the next few years, and after several changes in line-up and arrangement, they learned to fly... and took to the wind. Today, they are indeed flying high and in style - the style of The Eagles! This New England based Eagles Tribute Band has traveled up and down the east coast playing in venues both large and small... to crowds from 90 up to many thousands, sharing stages with the likes of Confederate Railroad, Foghat, and Kentucky Headhunters. If you're an Eagles fan, or a fan of Don Henley, Glenn Frey, or Joe Walsh, you'll absolutely enjoy this band's ability to accurately recreate those great songs we've all come to know and love. Spread Eagle: Tribute To The Eagles is comprised of 6 seasoned performers who have dedicated years of effort towards &amp;quot;getting it right&amp;quot; and they will wow you with their savvy ability to sound &amp;quot;just like The Eagles.&amp;quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: Tickets are $10.00 advance &lt;br /&gt;                            $14.00 the day of the show &lt;br /&gt;CALL: The BULL RUN @ 978-425-4311 &lt;br /&gt;          to order by credit card. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME: The show begins @ 8pm &lt;br /&gt;        (  I have entered 7pm  to allow plent of time before the show) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: PLEASE update your RSVP as to when you purchase your ticket.
