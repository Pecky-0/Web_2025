&lt;span&gt;Saturday, September 17 at 12:00am&lt;/span&gt; - 
&lt;span&gt;September 30 at 11:30pm&lt;/span&gt; This event is ONLINE only: On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was officially adopted by the United States of America in the historic halls of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A revolutionary time in our history, the Revolution has once again been born, in the homes of average citizens all across the United States. On September 17, 2011, we will hold an online money bomb in support of Ron Paul for President 2012. A money bomb is 
&lt;span&gt;a 24-hour fundraising event aimed at dramatically increasing funds for a specific candidate. In November 2007, Ron Paul raised more than $4.2 million in a single day. In December 2007, Ron Paul raised the most money in the history of American politics in a single day, raising more than $6 million; a record that still holds strong to this very day. Following the moneybomb, an "End of Quarter Push" will be held until September 30, to help Ron Paul finish the third fundraising quarter of 2011 in first place.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Please invite your friends, and tell them that it is essential that we all donate to Ron Paul at RonPaul2012.com on August 20, 2011, following his victory in the Ames, Iowa Straw poll, and to wish him a Happy Birthday.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;The money bomb will be held on Ron Paul's official campaign website, which you can find at
