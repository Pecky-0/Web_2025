With the warm temps, the snow should be melted from the field. It may rain, but we will play regardless of weather conditions. Everyone is welcome to join us. Whether you want to play flag-football, get some exercise, or just get outside, we welcome you to be a part of the fun. Its a great time and our main goal is to have fun and to develop friendships. We have a great group that regularly attends and we're always looking for more people to take part. Hope that you can make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cambridge Flag-Footballers&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go to Cambridge Common, from the Red-line, get off at Harvard Square and walk up the hill to Cambridge Common.
