I hope you are not letting the post-blizzard terrain get in the way of your celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I speak for everyone who was planning on coming to the Mardi Gras Party last Sunday, that we were disappointed not to make it there. Luckily, Sara has decided that a Post Mardi Gras Party is in order, so, don't lose those dogeared pages and marked passages you were going to read just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to the group and don't have any context to what I am referring to here, please look up the description of the previous meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to the fête gras!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361747066000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360693983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Post Literary Mardi Gras</name><id>104282322</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361736000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/104282322/</event_url></item>
