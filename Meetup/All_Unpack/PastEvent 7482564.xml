The Mountain Lion, also known as  Puma, Panther, Cougar, or Catamount, is the most widely distributed mammal in America, ranging from deserts to humid coastal forests, and from sea level to 10,000 foot elevations.  Come listen to Bill Betty, a Rhode Island native who studies these amazing creatures, as he gives a 90-minute presentation and discusses sightings and evidence of the big cats in our Nutmeg State. Displays and books on nature?s perfect predator will be available.  The program is free and will offer refreshments during the intermission.  Donations to the Land Trust are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Northern Connecticut Land Trust is an all-volunteer land preservation organization serving the towns of East Windsor, Ellington, Enfield, Somers, Stafford, Vernon.  The Trust has preserved 800 acres of open space, including 2 working farms.
