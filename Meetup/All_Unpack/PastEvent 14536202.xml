Then join 500 guests for Boston’s biggest fall singles events: the 4th Annual Project Smile Date Auction. During this exciting fundraising event, hosted by Karson and Kennedy, Project Smile will be auctioning off dates with traffic stopping police officers, smoldering fire fighters and other terrific single men and women ages 21-45. Their event has even resulted in a marriage for one lucky couple! There are even some Meet Up members being auctioned off!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attention ladies: Each bachelor comes with a pair of sexy high heels for the lady with the winning bid, courtesy of Sofft Shoes! Great shoes and a hot date, what can be better than that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, don’t miss out! Boston’s beauties are waiting for you to win a date with them! Each “couple” receives a gift certificate to use on their date to some of Boston’s best spots. Event will also feature a silent auction with airline tickets, Red Sox, Patriots and Celtics items, tickets and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy and lady with the highest bids will travel with their date in a Porsche or Aston Martin for their evening out, courtesy of Status Rides and Aston Martin of New England. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for  a terrific evening and support a great cause. All proceeds go directly to supporting Project Smile, the non profit organization dedicated to helping children involved in traumatic situations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are only $17 and include a gift bag for the first 400 guests. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets can be purchased at www.projectsmile.org/events.htm or at the door.
