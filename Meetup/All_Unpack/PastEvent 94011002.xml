The lodge will fill up fast so if you haven't made it up yet and have been thinking about it this might be the time to come up. For this particular weekend we are only accepting RSVPs for people who can stay 2 nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are located only 2 miles from Attitash and close to Wildcat, Cranmore, Black, and Bretton Woods right in the heart of North Conway and about 40 minutes from Sunday River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discount lift tickets to Bretton Woods will be available to those who stay at our lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
