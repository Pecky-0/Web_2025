Tracing their roots back to 1498, the choir is recognized throughout the world.  There are about 100 choristers between the ages of 10 and 14 and they perform each year in front of almost half a million people.  Tickets at $25 and the concert starts at 7:30.  Tickets are going fast.  Six of us already have tickets, so if you want to join us, call the church directly to (860) 525-5696 to order yours or you can take your chances at the door.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1166276173000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163373735000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holiday Concert</name><id>5262666</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165365000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/5262666/</event_url></item>
