&lt;p&gt;Baltimore, much like everyone else, doesn't have one player who can shutdown Rob Gronkowski with single coverage. A double-team from Ray Lewis and Ed Reed would work, but then what's left for underneath and over-the-top help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reed and Lewis are top-notch defenders, but neither would be able to slow down Gronk by themselves for a full 60 minutes. Now include Welker who can stretch the field if needed, but also widen it to take pressure away from Gronk and Branch, and the Ravens have not faced an offense like this all season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why the Baltimore defensive line needs to takeover this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime the Ravens blitz, Brady is just going to slip the rock out quick to Welker or Gronk, not to mention his pass protection is great and both Danny Woodhead and Benjarvis Green-Eliis are solid pass-blockers at running back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that New England will have success throwing the ball, so the question is whether the Ravens can slow the Patriots down enough to allow the Baltimore offense to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this picture says it all...be here or be square...my house in Pelham, "yes" replys will be sent my address on Saturday.&amp;nbsp;BYOB and bring something to share. Game starts at 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GO PATS!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
