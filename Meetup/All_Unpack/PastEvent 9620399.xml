We've had a consistent turnout of 6-8 people each week, and most don't RSVP, so those numbers on this site are usually low. We have a nice space on the second floor of the church with plenty of room for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The agenda leans towards informal, with some time for discussion and meditation. We try to keep it balanced. For those who haven't been, we encourage you to stop by and experience a group of intentionally-minded, awareness-seeking people. We'd love to see you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please try to show up on or before 6pm if you can, we have to lock the front door. If you are running late, no worries, just ring the bell and we'll be down to let you in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste,&lt;br /&gt;Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be meeting people at the door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234112373000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233167969000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Mindfulness Meetup</name><id>9620399</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233615600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9620399/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
