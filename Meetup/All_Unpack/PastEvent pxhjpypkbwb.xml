&lt;p&gt;Our meetup was scheduled for july 17th, but I have had to change the date to July 24th, Sunday, from 1-4pm.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully this won't inconvenience anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the last meet, one of our members brought her two adorable dogs who proved to be too anxious and unsocialized to participate in the meet.&amp;nbsp; The owner worked hard to reassure them and keep them from growling at other dogs, but it proved too difficult.&amp;nbsp; If anyone has this type of dog, we highly recommend that you contact Pete Westland, Holliston Meadows trainer, at&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(774) 249 9808&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and work with him until your dog(s) can comfortably be around other dogs that they don't know (before&amp;nbsp; attending our meet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing you all again on July 24th!&lt;/p&gt;
