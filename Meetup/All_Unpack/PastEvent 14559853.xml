Herb will give a short workshop, discussion around 8:30 (when most people have arrived) about Dating Skills, ways to feel comfortable and more confident. Herb will provide vegetarian food though he appreciates you bringing something vegetarian too, appetizers, entrees, desserts or drinks. Not a requirement though. Bring friends, particularly of your opposite gender so we have a mix of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:00 pm - 11:00 pm&lt;br /&gt;8:30-10pm workshop&lt;br /&gt;($15)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herb has led relationship courses for over 30 years and also is a personality types expert with a focus on relationship dynamics with over 20 years experience teaching the Enneagram nationwide. He is the author of the Idiot's Guide to the Enneagram, is an individual, couples and family therapist and also does phone sessions (including typing people by phone) using the Enneagram and Myers Briggs as tools for relationship healing and personal growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://herb@herbpearce.com" target="_blank"&gt;herb@herbpearce.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.herbpearce.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.herbpearce.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;781 648 3737&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284855428000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Personality Types</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Personality-Types-Enneagram</urlname><id>1405281</id><group_lat>42.4099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>Personality Types</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282906847000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Dating Skills" Singles Workshop, Potluck</name><id>14559853</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284850800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Personality-Types-Enneagram/events/14559853/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/d/8/global_17492264.jpeg</photo_url></item>
