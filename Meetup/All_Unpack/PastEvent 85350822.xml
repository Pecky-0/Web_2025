&lt;p&gt;They regularly do 4 hour workshops around the country, when individuals get into what's called the "hotseat", and they get to ask Abraham questions.  The questions and the answers always serve everyone in brilliant and inspiring ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've now made viewing these workshops available on-line, and it's fantastic!  (There's a $75 fee.)  So, we'd like to do this with YOU!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll watch it together on our HD TV, discuss it together during the breaks and when it's over, and share in a potluck lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time we did this it was great learning and fun .  Please plan on contributing to cover the workshop fee.  How much will depend on how many people participate.  Whatever amount it is, it will be a "bargain"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a healthy variety of lunch and snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE, this time more than ever, it's important that you only RSVP yes if you really plan on attending, or if your plans change, to let us know in a timely fashion.  Please always be considerate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to a wonderful day with you!&lt;/p&gt;
