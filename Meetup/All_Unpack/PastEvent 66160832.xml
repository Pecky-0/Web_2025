&lt;p&gt;Because of a personal relationship with the film-makers, we are able to screen 'MYTHIC JOURNEYS' - a very cool combination of documentary and story-telling that talks about the impact that the loss of mythic imagination has on our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features the voices of Mark Hamill, Lance Henrikson, and Tim Curry in a very cool animated through-story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See a great trailer for the film at: &lt;a href="http://mythmovie.net/"&gt;http://mythmovie.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see an interview with the film-makers that I (Boysen) did last month for the ManKind Project -Â &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyq_uVo-yOU"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyq_uVo-yOU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film is not a dry documentary - it is a great series of inquiries about what we lose when we lose the power of myth - and what we GAIN by adding it to our lives and exploring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an OPEN MOVIE! Men and women are welcome, this film is also appropriate for anyone over 13. &lt;strong&gt;There is no charge for the screening, but we will gratefully accept donations to help our scholarship fund&lt;/strong&gt; and our local community. Feel free to bring popcorn &amp;amp; snacks to share and soft drinks (no alcohol, please.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will briefly introduce our OPEN MEN's Group before the screening and will stay to answer questions about the ManKind Project, the New Warrior Training Adventure (a Hero's Journey for men!) or OPEN MEN after the screening. MAXIMUM CAPACITY is 50 people - we expect that we will have a FULL HOUSE, so RSVP early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really excited about this - it's a great film.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Boysen </member_name><member_id>7527796</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338474169000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Men</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>openmen</urlname><id>1200732</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5500030518</group_lon><name>Open Men's Group - Personal Mastery Workgroup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337872025000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>OPEN Movie Night!
