<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our fearless leader has encountered a work conflict.  We are changing the times just a bit for this event.  The hike will run 1:00-5:00 with a food stop afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quabbin Reservoir is an 18 mile water source for 40% of Massachusetts residents.  It was created in 1927 by flooding the existing towns behind the Windsor Dam and Goodnough Dike.  The Nipmuc Indians refered to this area as Quabbin or &amp;quot;the meeting of many waters&amp;quot;.  This area is now considered an accidential wilderness and is the home to many animals.  We are hoping to see eagles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are planning a 5 to 6 mile hike near the visitors center and will include views from Quabbin Hill and Lookout Tower.  We are not sure what the exact conditions will be that day.  Plan on dressing in layers ready for winter weather.  It is necessary to be in winter hiking boots that are waterproof.  I would suggest bringing micro spikes and or snow shoes.  Please bring water, snacks, and a lunch to eat on the ride up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the commuter lot, exit 68 off of route 84 in Tolland.  At that exit there is a Dunkin Donuts for snacks and a bathroom.  Please be there no later than 12:00 p.m. if you would like to carpool or caravan.  We will figure out the carpool situation that day.  The hike is a one hour drive from this meeting place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin the hike from the Quabbin Park Visitors Center at 1:00 p.m.  We expect to be out on the trail for approximately 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quabbin Visitors Center 485 Ware Road Blechertown, MA 01007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Belchertown&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;address=485+Ware+Road&amp;amp;zipcode=01007" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ACTUAL location&lt;/b&gt; of Visitor's Center (lat. 42.2795, lon. -72.349)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/l=42.2795;g=-72.349" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting site for carpool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Tolland&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=65+Merrow+Road&amp;amp;zipcode=06084" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Department of Conservation and Recreation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Silver Jeep Liberty</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Janice</member_name><member_id>3804430</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234804412000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233704677000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Hike at Quabbin Park/Reservoir, Belchertown, MA</name><id>9666409</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234630800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/9666409/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/b/global_2859963.jpeg</photo_url></item>
