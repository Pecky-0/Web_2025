<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Due to the need to end by 8:30, we will begin at 6:30 with a short discussion of Ian's plans for a documentary film on the Peak Oil issue. (I'm assuming not everyone will be able to make it at the new time on such short notice.) At 7, we will listen to a draft of Mike's planned USM presentation and discuss it. We will discuss what to do at the next meeting, and if there is more time left over, just talk about whatever we want until 8:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voluntary donations will be accepted to cover costs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Advocates for Oil Awareness</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-169</urlname><id>113465</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1129334662000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness November Meetup</name><id>4782884</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1131751800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-169/events/4782884/</event_url></item>
