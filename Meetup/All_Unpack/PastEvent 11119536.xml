Please bring friends and family along. The Enfield public needs to see us as a constant reminder that they must be vigilent and studious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to attend the biweekly meetings of the CT Patriot Alliance so you can learn more about your constitutional rights. I will be going from now on, that's for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are parking behind the white/red building that used to be a Broyhill furniture outlet. They are out of business so I don't think anyone will mind. If it is hot, be sure to bring water and a camping chair if it is difficult for you to stand for the entire hour. Remember, it is your presence that counts!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you next week!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In patriotism,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for people carrying signs.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251575398000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250370669000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Weekly Mini "T" in Enfield</name><id>11119536</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250964000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/11119536/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/2/f/global_9746095.jpeg</photo_url></item>
