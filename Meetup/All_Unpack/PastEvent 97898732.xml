&lt;p&gt;9 am to 5 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retreat is designed for those with no knowledge of Buddhism or for those who wish to freshen their knowledge of the basics. The retreat includes basic history with focus on the creation of the branches (lineages), study of basic Buddhist concepts shared by all forms of Buddhism and basic Nichiren Buddhist concepts. Buddhist etiquette is also presented with the presentation of the altar and its meaning. Beginners classes and retreats are open to anyone who wishes to learn more about the Dharma and or Nichiren Buddhism. A small fee covers materials and lunch. This class has a cut off for registration. Please register early. This class will be canceled if no one is registered by the deadline. You do not have to prepay for the class. (The meetup page does not always show the number of people registered as we use several media’s for our calendar and events.)&lt;/p&gt;
