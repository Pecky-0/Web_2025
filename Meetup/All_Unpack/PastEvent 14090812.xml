So let's see as many movies there as we can!  Today's choice is &amp;quot;Coco Chanel &amp;amp; Igor Stravinsky&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the Theatre Des Champs-Elys√©es, Igor Stravinsky premieres his &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rite Of Spring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Coco Chanel attends the premiere and is mesmerized. But the revolutionary work is too modern, too radical: the enraged audience boos and jeers. A near riot ensues. Stravinsky is inconsolable. Seven years later, now rich, respected and successful, Coco Chanel meets Stravinsky again - a penniless refugee living in exile in Paris after the Russian Revolution. The attraction between them is immediate and electric. Coco offers Stravinsky the use of her villa in Garches so that he will be able to work, and he moves in straight away, with his children and consumptive wife. And so a passionate, intense love affair between two creative giants begins.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will attend the 7:00pm showtime.  Tickets are $10.50 each, buy at the box office.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279759213000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279044680000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cinema City Last Hurrah - Coco Chanel &amp; Igor Stravinsky</name><id>14090812</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279579500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/14090812/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
