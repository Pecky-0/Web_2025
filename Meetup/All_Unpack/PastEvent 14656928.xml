Please join us to celebrate Labor Day with a &lt;b&gt;challenging 2-3 hour hike&lt;/b&gt; co-hosted by New Haven Treks' Evan Brewster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: Water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST:  Please contribute one dollar towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at West Rock, which is a Connecticut State Park located in New Haven and Hamden.  There are various entrances to the park, but we will be parking at Lake Wintergreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the Lake Wintergreen entrance, which is located on Main Street, between 10:00 and 10:15 a.m., and we'll start walking by 10:20. We will hike for 2-3 hours.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: Please use Google Maps (or, your GPS) to find the intersection of Main Street and Valerie Court in Hamden -- this is the closest possible intersection that is actually listed on Google Maps, as the lot itself is NOT listed. From Main and Valerie, drive DOWNHILL on Main Street and you will see the parking area at the bottom of the hill, where Main Street bends to the right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING NOTE: There is no fee for parking in the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325276" target="_blank"&gt;Park website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=main+street+and+valerie+court+hamden+ct&amp;amp;sll=41.316334,-72.946592&amp;amp;sspn=0.011991,0.013797&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Main+St+%26+Valerie+Ct,+Hamden,+New+Haven,+Connecticut+06514&amp;amp;z=16" target="_blank"&gt;Intersection from which to drive downhill 100 yards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet Evan and Sarah by the big trail map</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sarah </member_name><member_id>7903956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283892194000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hiking-575</urlname><id>1282762</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Walks in the Woods</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283622141000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Labor Day Walk at West Rock (Lake Wintergreen)</name><id>14656928</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283782500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hiking-575/events/14656928/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/f/global_5862655.jpeg</photo_url></item>
