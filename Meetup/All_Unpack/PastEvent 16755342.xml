&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Format: I have 3-4 formats selected (win/loss, points...) and will determine the best one to use when I know how many people will be playing and how many sets I can borrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game sets: I will need to borrow a few.&amp;nbsp; We will be using basic at least but I would like to have some of the expansions as well.&amp;nbsp; Send me a message if you would be willing to bring one and what set it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to bring (select all that apply ;)  &lt;br /&gt;Games - If there is time after we can play anything you want to bring.&amp;nbsp; We will have our standard set and there will be plenty of after tournament Dominion. &lt;br /&gt;Food   (non-snacks) - We can refrigerate or heat whatever you want to bring. I don't know what I will be making for diner and we should be done with the tournament by dinner time depending on how many people come.&amp;nbsp; I will at the least make up another batch of spaghetti. &lt;br /&gt;Food (snacks) - If you bring it, it will probably get eaten.  &lt;br /&gt;Drinks (non-alcoholic) - Sometimes everyone brings some; sometimes no one does. "You pay your dime you take your chances."  &lt;br /&gt;Drinks   (alcoholic) - I'm not driving and we'll have plenty of room for those   who want to crash, but we're not big drinkers ourselves.  &lt;br /&gt;Chairs -  I expect to have enough for this event.&amp;nbsp; I can seat 18-20 so unless more people come than expected, we'll be ok. &lt;br /&gt;Other - Bring anything you like as long as it doesn't get anyone in trouble with the law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel/Parking:  &lt;br /&gt;Parking  - I live close to the beginning of the  street, so at soon as you make  the turn start looking for parking. Most  of the parking in the area is  resident only, but I will have parking  permits by the front door for  everyone to park on the street. We have a  driveway and it is clear enough for at least two people to park tandem. &lt;br /&gt;Train - we live 6-8 minute  walk from  the back exit of Alewife (from the platform, go up the stairs in the  direction the trains come). Just walk away from the main road  (the only  one you can see from that exit) When you come to a fork in the  trail  take the middle one. Clay street is a straight shot from there.  Turn  left at Clay and we are on the left in a brown building.  &lt;br /&gt;Bus - nearby is the 350, 77, 79, 83, 87, 88, 89&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me if you have any questions at all. Ben 617-997-3545&lt;/p&gt;
