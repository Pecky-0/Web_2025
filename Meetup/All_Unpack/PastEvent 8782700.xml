Some for fun, some for exercise, and some for meeting new people. We play to have fun, and all are welcome to join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We play on a turf field located very close to the Alewife T Stop (redline). If travelling by T, get off the redline at the Alewife stop, and follow signs to Rindge Ave. Look for stadium lights, grand stands, and a turf field after crossing the Alewife Brook Pkwy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ex: I'll be the guy in the back with a Meetup t-shirt</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222537465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221747213000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>430 PM - FLAG FOOTBALL - SAT - RUSSELL FIELD</name><id>8782700</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221943500000</time><rsvp_limit>32</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8782700/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/3/c/global_5447180.jpeg</photo_url></item>
