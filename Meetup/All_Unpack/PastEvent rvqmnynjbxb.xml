The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ” &lt;br /&gt;Irene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ This was a fun time. Alan's leadership style is loose, offering suggestions and some instruction. Nice group of people, too.”&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“ It is the best drumming circle in the area! People really come together in a community, and with a community spirit. Instruments are provided if you don't have one. ... ” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a chair and put it in your car tonight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SATURDAY!

Huge parking lot...can’t miss it! Parking is NOT a problem. There is a traffic light where you turn into the parking lot, if you are coming from Newton Corner past the IHOP and other shopping - there's a left turn lane with a light and a sign that says &amp;quot;Publick Theater&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming from Boston/Cambridge, it's a right turn (no traffic light) - again look for the Publick Theater signs. The signs will lead you to a large parking lot across from the Days Inn, and we will be waiting for you over by the river at the far end of the parking lot near the playground. Here's a link to a great Google map with the little pointer right where we're going:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1234 Soldiers Field Rd, &lt;br /&gt;Parking Lot #4&lt;br /&gt;Brighton, MA 02135&lt;br /&gt;Link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get lost, call me!&lt;br /&gt;A former member&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drumconnection.com"&gt;The DrumConnection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You'll hear the drums!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>1328052</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276993375000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drummers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DrumConnection</urlname><id>886763</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>The Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275279731000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Drum Circle Meetup - Bar-B-Que!
