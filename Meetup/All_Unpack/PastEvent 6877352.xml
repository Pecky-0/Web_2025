(Tyler!)&lt;br /&gt;4) Lightning talks (If anyone has one they want to present.)&lt;br /&gt;5) Open problem solving.  (Bring your questions and code you need help with.)&lt;br /&gt;6) Show and Tell. (Bring anything you want to share.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have Pizza again...so let me know if there is anything you must have / are allergic to. Anchovies are NEVER an option. Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you next week!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You can't miss me.
