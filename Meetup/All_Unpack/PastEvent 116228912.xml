Many Boston Volunteers know him through coming to the program and working with us. Tomorrows meal program is dedicated to Fred who founded the program in the early eighties and worked each performance til passing it on to us last December by stepping down as director. Our meal program will be much different this week as we celebrate the man who started the program so long ago. We have a few people who will recount our collective feelings and will ask the guests to share some thoughts on his life. &lt;br /&gt;

Anybody who has met Fred knows he was something very special and a rare man who never did anything wring and not once in his life even cussed. If you have met Fred or know him and would like to come to this farewell party for a truly wonderful person. We will start at five pm and the service part will go on until 615 pm At that time we will serve the meal and your welcome to stay and help us serve&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>25751022</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367375370000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Boston Volunteers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BigEnoughtoDeliver</urlname><id>1343564</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Volunteers.
