The first three films could be considered the dark side and the next set of films after the new year will no doubt inspire, educate and motivate.  These films will be held the first Tuesday of each month on the campus of, and co-sponsored by, the University of New England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our October film is &amp;quot;Collapse&amp;quot; which is about peak oil, economic meltdown and, well, Michael Ruppert (who is a fascinating character in his own right).  I found the film intriguing and, despite the title, was bolstered by Ruppert's opinions on what we CAN do in the face of enormous change ahead.  Many of you will remember Ruppert as one of the talking heads in &amp;quot;The End of Suburbia.&amp;quot;  We will definitely follow this up with a group discussion.
