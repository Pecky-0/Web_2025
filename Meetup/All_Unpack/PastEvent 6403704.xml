Whether you've been planning a Star Wars campaign for months or you're jonesing for some GURPS but are willing to run some Vampire, come out and see who else is looking for GMs/players. This meetup is happening at Your Move Games, a store in Davis Square that has gaming space you can use if you want to get started right away, or you can just meet people here, get some e-mails, and schedule something elsewhere later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally am looking for beginner-to-medium-experienced players for a D&amp;amp;D 3.5 campaign:&lt;br /&gt;Evil stalks through the city of Saltmarsh. Are you brave enough to walk the roads of Saltmarsh, face the intrigues of Saltmarsh... serve a Lady of Saltmarsh? She seeks four heroes capable of navigating the streets, swamps, and perhaps even the sea. Sign up for a campaign offering adventures of all kinds and rewards for those who earn them. This D&amp;amp;D 3.5 campaign is run by a DM more concerned with your characters than your character stats. If you're a creative, smart person, come to the meetup or send an e-mail with a character idea to ElfWord@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a GM that intends to come to this meetup recruiting for a specific campaign, e-mail me with a one-paragraph blurb and I'll update the meetup info with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE RSVP! &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; is fine, but help the organizers serve you better by indicating what times/locations would be better for you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christian Loidl</member_name><member_id>1035154</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542211000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190398787000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Campaigns Recruiting in Davis Square!</name><id>6403704</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191448800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/6403704/</event_url></item>
