This is another chance for those of you who missed Eric's presentation last fall!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very lucky indeed to be hosting Eric Toensmeier, author of &lt;i&gt;Perennial Vegetables&lt;/i&gt;, here in the Portland area for an evening slideshow and discussion on an important category of permaculture plants - &lt;b&gt;perennial vegetables!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perennial vegetables can provide years of harvests with very little care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maine gardeners can grow many of the world’s best species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;These crops have excellent potential for small-scale agriculture projects around the world and their use can mitigate many of the negative impacts inherent in annual cropping of similar species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Eric Toensmeier has comprehensively filled a huge gap in the sustainable landscape.
