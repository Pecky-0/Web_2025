This will be a slightly different crowd than the Concord dances, and a lot larger (250+).  You'll also see some hardcore Lindy Hoppers who will be doing some classic line dances such as the Shim Sham and the Big Apple.  A beginner swing lesson will be taught by Roger Weiss from 8 to 9pm, and the band will play from 9pm to midnight.  The band's lineup will be the most talented one ever so the musicianship is going to be incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information about this dance series is at &lt;a href="http://www.bostonswingdance.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.bostonswingdance.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190074036000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Swing Dancers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>swingdancing-110</urlname><id>549506</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston-Area Swing/Blues Dance Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189609488000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swing Dance in Watertown</name><id>6344153</id><headcount>150</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189900800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/swingdancing-110/events/6344153/</event_url></item>
