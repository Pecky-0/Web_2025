This unique, stylish, and globe-trotting comedy focuses on a pair of orphaned brothers, Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) and Bloom (Academy Award winner Adrien Brody), from their humble childhood spent in countless bleak foster homes to their lives as distinguished, world-renowned con men. 

Constantly concocting “stories” for them to enact, Stephen endeavors to orchestrate the ultimate grift. Bloom, on the other hand, longs to leave the swindling behind and live an “unwritten life” free of his brother’s design. 

Working with Bang Bang (Academy Award nominee Rinko Kikuchi), an explosives expert and “associate,” they prepare for their last hurrah. Their spectacular plan involves luring and defrauding a bored, beautiful, eccentric heiress from New Jersey named Penelope (Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz). When Bloom develops feelings for her, the dynamic among all of them shifts and threatens to fracture their tight, fraternal alliance, propelling them into their most dangerous scheme ever. 

Appropriately narrated by the always-entertaining expert on all things grift, Ricky Jay, BROTHERS BLOOM is the latest film from director Rian Johnson (BRICK).
