He's aiming squarely at developers who have projects they want to use testing for, but don't know where to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you wanted to become test-infected but couldn't find the start of the thread to pull?  Marshall will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephan Richter&lt;/b&gt;: How to Test the Hard Stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephan will cover testing network-driven components, RDB stubbing, test setup layering and stuff like that. Recently he used manuel to do this sort of testing by simulating CLIs and Shell access in a doctest-style test, so he may cover that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your testing challenges and the impossible to automate projects that haunt you at night, we'll see what Stephan can do with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're meeting as usual at the Microsoft NERD Center, 1 Memorial Drive in Cambridge.  People will be there starting at 6:30, talks begin at 7.  There will likely be pizza donated by Microsoft.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ned Batchelder</member_name><member_id>1824278</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276646650000</updated><rating><average>4.44999980927</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>38</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273145349000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May Python meetup: Testing Topics</name><id>13402161</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274310000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/13402161/</event_url></item>
