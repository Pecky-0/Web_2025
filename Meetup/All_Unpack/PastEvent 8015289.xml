We'd love to see all the fun couples we've already met and also meet the rest of you! The Sox are out of town but on TV that night so we can watch the game w/o it being too crazy. Plus, did I mention nachos, chicken wings and lots more great food??? Hope to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us downstairs or give us a call and we'll point you our way! 6177801329</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247452809000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>The Sox are out of town so the line won't be around the corner!</why><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211845219000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour Part Deux!</name><id>8015289</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1213399800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/8015289/</event_url></item>
