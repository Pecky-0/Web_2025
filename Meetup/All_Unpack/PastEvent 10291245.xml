This doesn't mean people should wait until 11 o'clock to get to New Haven to start talking to people. By all means, go out earlier, get social and then meet up with us and bring some women with you.&lt;br /&gt;JC&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Details to Come</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319645515000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240973440000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Night - May 2nd - New Haven</name><id>10291245</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241319600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/10291245/</event_url></item>
