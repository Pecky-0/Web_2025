It is a vast area that includes deep woods, low hills, farmland, meadows, streams, and beautiful bodies of water such as Meadow Pond (see photo). Great Brook Farm is also a four-season recreation area, as it has cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter, and hiking and horseback riding for much of the rest of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail network at Great Brook Farm State Park is extensive, allowing outdoors lovers to really get deep into some rugged land here. One particularly scenic loop is to start at the Hart Barn and Ski Center at the Lowell Road parking lot, and head clockwise along a number of trails, including the Lantern Loop, and Litchfield Loop, and the rugged Stone Row trail. From here, a short side trip can be taken north into Chelmsford, where a trail runs alongside the serene Russell Mill Pond (see photo). From this short spur, hikers can continue on to the Woodchuck Trail and the Garrison Loop, where there are a few historic sites to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234106011000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231158646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking February Meetup</name><id>9447756</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233504000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/9447756/</event_url></item>
