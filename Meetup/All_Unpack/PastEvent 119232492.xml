<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Anybody out there like to be outdoors and enjoy some live performances and good food? The Japanese spring festival will be held this year at Boston City Hall Plaza on Sunday May 19th. Admission is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhibits will include food booths (approx. 34), non-food booths (approx. 80) and stage performances. Last year, over 13 000 went to the event, so it promises to be crowded and full of fun. We could meet up, eat some good Japanese food at the food booths, watch performances and support local vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website: &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://www.japanfestivalboston.org/"&gt;http://www.japanfestivalboston.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting place:&lt;/strong&gt; At the Dunkin Donuts right out of the the Government Center T stop (Green and Blue line). Take a right when you come up from the escalators, and will see it right there. There is a flower shop to the left of DD and a Starbucks to the right of DD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting time:&lt;/strong&gt; At 11am. Last year, the food tickets were sold out early in the day, so let’s make sure we can get there on time to purchase some this year. If you plan to arrive late, email me and I will give you my phone number to see where we will be when you get here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always - please update your RSVP if your plans change.&lt;/p&gt;
