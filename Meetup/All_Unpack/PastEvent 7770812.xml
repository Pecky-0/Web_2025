We have a fenced in, matted outdoor area for play and bathroom needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to meeting new friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;  The time for this meet-up has changed to 3:30 due to the training class schedule at Off The Leash.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; Please keep in mind that the health of our small dog friends is one of our top priorities. When dogs play together, it is very important that each dog is current on all of their vaccinations. These vaccinations include: DHLPP, Bordatella (canine cough) and Rabies. Please ensure that your dog is current on all vaccinations before coming to the meet ups!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily McHugh </member_name><member_id>6348089</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211226119000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>small Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-41</urlname><id>404601</id><group_lat>41.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>The North Attleboro Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208635938000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The North Attleboro Small Breed Dogs May Meeting</name><id>7770812</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211052600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-41/events/7770812/</event_url></item>
