This walk will take place at 10:30 AM. It is people and dog friendly. All dogs must start on leash until we know everybody gets along. There is a wide path that provides plenty of space for several walkers with their doggy companions. The Town of Hatfield is a historic agricultural river town on the west bank of the Connecticut River. The Connecticut River forms the eastern and southern boundary of the town. It is also part of the Mill River Watershed. There are incredible views of the Connecticut River on the left side of the path. On the right side of the path, you will view the farmlands of Hatfield. While driving to this location, you will view the remarkable historic character of Hatfield made up of a dense concentration of well-preserved 18th and 19th century family homes. Plan to walk an hour out and turn around to walk the same path back. Bring your camera, too, the views are really pretty. See Mapquest, Google or Yahoo for directions to 58 Main St., Hatfield. The building is a former school which has also been used as a library. It's two story, brick - parking is behind the building, and there is a ball field there also. The path along the dike is accessible from behind this building.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be parked behind the building.
