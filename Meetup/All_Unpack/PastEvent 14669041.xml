There are quite a few open spaces in the Back Bay Fens park. The streets Park Drive and Fenway border the park. It is fairly accessible by T and by car. If coming by T, you can pick either Kenmore (All Tracks), Fenway (D Track) or Museum of Fine Arts (E Track) stops, all of which are on the Green Line but different tracks. If you are driving, since it's a holiday, meters are turned off. You can find good parking near Evans Way Park and on the side streets around the Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will most likely try to setup near the track/turf area.

However, do be receptive to some help or pointers if you're less experienced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sorry for the short notice, if the Back Bay Fens area is popular, I'll try to give a few days next time.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alex Ford</member_name><member_id>8374684</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1283869916000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283740007000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Recreational Labor Day Volleyball in Fenway</name><id>14669041</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283799600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/14669041/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/3/global_1997523.jpeg</photo_url></item>
