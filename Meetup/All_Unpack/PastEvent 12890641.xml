Several of you have expressed a strong desire to become Ensemble members--we're dying to see you. If you have even a moderate amount of experience in the performing arts, or feel you have an intuitive knack for improv, and you enjoy serving those in need, Laughing Matter will serve you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How would it feel to perform on a hospital floor in the thick of it all? How about a hall full of enthusiastic residents at a shelter? How about doing hip-hop alongside seniors at a senior home? You can experience this reality as a Laughing Matter improviser. In addition, professional training workshops by guest trainers from the Boston improv houses, field trips, and performances at special events are opportunities Laughing Matter improvisers can look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275587848000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268751577000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Rehearsal - Ensemble B Casting Call 4</name><id>12890641</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269720000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/12890641/</event_url></item>
