The date is the Saturday 19th of November at 6.00 pm. You can choose something from the menu or you can order the Rodizio and pay $15.00 and eat all you want with buffet included. Beverages, taxes and gratuity are separate. The reservation is made and other meet up groups such as the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and European are coming. So then let&amp;#146;s celebrate before the holidays and let&amp;#146;s eat, drink and converse with each other. Parking is complimentary at the side of the restaurant. Thank You Gianni Opi20000@aol.com 158 School ST Everett, MA 02149&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321747566000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320240223000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner Party </name><id>39634582</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321743600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/39634582/</event_url></item>
