This is sure to be a cool event and the location is ideal for  showing films but keeping it a party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wedeln Ski &amp;amp; Snowboard Film Festival&lt;br /&gt;Date: Nov 23rd&lt;br /&gt;Location: &amp;quot;The Place&amp;quot; , 2 Broad Street, Boston&lt;br /&gt;Time: 7pm to 10pm&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $15&lt;br /&gt;free appetizers and many door prizes.&lt;br /&gt;21+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Films include:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Eastern Boarder&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Blurred&amp;quot; by Huckfest&lt;br /&gt;Poor Boyz Productions &amp;quot;Reasons!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Rage Films &amp;quot;Such is Life&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hook you all up with free tickets but the proceeds are going to charity.  $ from the film festival will go to the Peter Bragan Ski Race Scholarship.   This scholarship helps several high School Ski Racer compete at the national level. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-sale tickets are $10 but only available at the Wedeln Ski Club booth at the Ski Expo (booth e11) at Bayside Expo center this weekend or if you bump into me :).  I will be there early, come by and say hello.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several Meetups will be at the the film festival.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227917495000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226975013000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ski and Snowboard Film Fest at "The Place"</name><id>9182741</id><headcount>100</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227484800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/9182741/</event_url></item>
