Personally, I get tired of flatly lighted portraits. So- Let's think about lighting as an interesting process of setting up the lights to impart a little bit of personality - really work to get a bit of character into a portrait of a model. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can explore how dramatic lighting can be achieved with just a single light source strategically placed to a location. Perhaps where it can create high contrast shadows on the face of a subject. Or Maybe some fun side lighting to force a shadow mysteriously down the middle of the subject. We can play with something I like to call &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; Lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have the lovely and energetic Ellen as our model for the evening. I can not guarantee each and everyone will get the op to shoot this evening- but bring your cameras anyway and we'll see what we can make happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to spending some quality photo time with you all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Scott and Donna&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one talking at the front of the room! =)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1297248535000</updated><rating><average>4.90999984741</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295038328000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dramatic Lighting Showcase with the 7 Hills Camera Club</name><id>16051059</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297123200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/16051059/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/8/0/global_20787712.jpeg</photo_url></item>
