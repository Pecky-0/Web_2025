&lt;p&gt;Host: Steve Ob1. 603-491-1962  ob@tds.net &lt;br /&gt;

 RAIN or SHINE!   THIS IS A DOG &amp;amp; CHILD FRIENDLY EVENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it will be either snowy or rainy. But, I will need to get out and about.  So, join me at anytime, rain or shine for a easy hike, or just for drinks. After we hike, I will need to refuel and medicate the pain away from our hike. So, after the hike, we plan to head over to "Shorty's". It is in the parking lot of the mall. Less than a miles from the our hike.  If you can't make it at 1 pm.? Join us anytime. I will have my phone on, and the trails crisscross each other. Can't make it for the hike? Than, join us for drinks at 4 pm. at Shorty's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This it an easy hike on the trails at Mine Falls Park in Nashua. Please &lt;img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/0/8/event_164046152.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;know this is not a race. My intent is to enjoy the views of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to just get out, to enjoy nature, and to chat along the way. It is not meant, as a good workout. I thought that we would enjoy nature and the history of this park for about two or three hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. This park is just full of beautiful views and history. So, come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of new and old friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 1:00 pm in the lot at the end of Coliseum Ave, which is off of Rte 130 in Nashua. Steve Ob1. will be doing the introductions at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECTIONS: Take exit 6 from Route 3 (Route 130) and go west towards Brookline, take the second entrance to the shopping center area (Colliseum Ave), go all the way to the end of the road for the parking lot. Look for the meetup sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone cares to, we can then go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a drink or hot chocolate, at a nearby restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
