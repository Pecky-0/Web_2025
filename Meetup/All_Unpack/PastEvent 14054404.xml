Will you join the exhausted defenders of King's Watch in the final push against tyranny?  Come join us in this two-hour-long sword-swinging adventure designed for ages 10+.  Fight the villains, protect the innocent, save the day!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281744701000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278708044000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adventure Night: Loose Ends</name><id>14054404</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281740400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/14054404/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/9/e/global_6162670.jpeg</photo_url></item>
