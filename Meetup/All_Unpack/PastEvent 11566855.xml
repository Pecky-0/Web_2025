I've been working in DC and can't wait to hit the trails back home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a while since we last played in the Middlesex Fells and I would like to return to the rock circuit. This hike will take us up and down a few hills and provide some playtime over rocky paths. This is a personal favorite, plus you don't see as many people as you do on the western side of the reservations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Rock Circuit&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Length: 3.7 miles &lt;br /&gt;time: 3 1/2 hours +/- &lt;br /&gt;Difficulty: easy to moderate. While this can be very subjective I am going by my own experience and what I read online. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan for an easy pace with some ups and downs. There is not much in elevation change but the terrain is rocky. I strongly suggest boots or a good pair of trail shoes. Please bring enough water and snacks for you and your pups. Please remember that this time of year can get cold.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Flynn Ice Rink and head out from there. Any questions please feel free to email me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell number is 508-510-1136, in case you're in the area and lost.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256653020000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254873629000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Middlesex Fells Rock Circuit</name><id>11566855</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256479200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/11566855/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/4/5/global_11098677.jpeg</photo_url></item>
