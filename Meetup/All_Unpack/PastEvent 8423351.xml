<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's go for a walk / hike up the mountain. We'll take the Semuhenna Trail, which starts from the ski area parking lot, about 100 yards to the right of the lodge (as you are looking at the mountain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trail is on the north side of the mountain, so sun should not be too intense. It is also not steep. There is one steep section, but it is avoidable (and preferred by me :-) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time wise, I think would be about three  hours round trip. And it will not rain!! Just watch the reports and plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards we can go to the Mountain Barn, on Rt 31 in Princeton for refreshments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can also car pool from Worcester.  Contact me, or call 508-265-2889 with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time we had two, next time three, so lets go for more!    See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron M.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a Blue Hyundai Santa Fe.
