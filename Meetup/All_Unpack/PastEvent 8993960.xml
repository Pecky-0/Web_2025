That those representatives in government should be open, accessible, accountable and responsive as outlined in Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NHCLG believes that government should be limited in scope only to those functions which serve to protect the life, liberty, and property of the governed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NHCLG accomplishes its goals through activism, involvement, and educating both local representatives and voters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NHCLG will strive to hold all locally elected officials accountable for their actions in order to ensure that they act on the behalf of the people.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Our group will have exclusive use of an off-hours section of Margaritas.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg Surbey</member_name><member_id>3479382</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225816555000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224480559000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Coalition for Limited Government - Greater Nashua Monthly Meeting</name><id>8993960</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1225643400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/8993960/</event_url></item>
