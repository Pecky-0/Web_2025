Come out with the family and enjoy pancakes (including our famous pumpkin pancakes!) , sausage, juice and more all for the great price of free!  That’s right, there is no charge but, the Jaycees are asking for donations for the South Windsor Food &amp;amp; Fuel Bank in conjunction with our annual Thanksgiving Baskets for the Needy project that provides more than 100 less fortunate families in South Windsor with a lovely Thanksgiving dinner.  In addition to having a great breakfast there will be crafts for the kids and  holiday photo opportunities. Children are welcome to wear costumes.
