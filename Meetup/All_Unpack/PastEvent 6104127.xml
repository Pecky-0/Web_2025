After party is included in the price and runs from 11-1 am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sweet deal is that the price is a wee 20 bucks, and if ya find a buddy to join you, it's 2 for 35 through Aug 29th.  Thirty bucks at the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click below for details and to order tickets.  Tickets are available online with id required for pick-up on the 29th.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostoneventguide.com/events/spc8_07.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostoneven...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details and directions, check out Bay State cruises site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.baystatecruisecompany.com/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.baystatecr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be grabbing nachos next door at the Seaport Bar and Grill at 6 pm (in the bar) if anyone wishes to join me for dinner.
