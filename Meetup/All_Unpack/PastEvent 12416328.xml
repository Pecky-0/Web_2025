Each photographer will have more than ample shooting time and have considerable leeway to adjust lighting and set.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are available and have been itching to work in this type of setting then this shoot is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kel has worked at a few of our Meetups, including our recent Meetup this past Thursday,  and has done a great job.  She has great posing range and can work with classic and avant-garde styles.  She also has a good wardrobe to compliment this style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Glamour-Photography/photos/659015/"&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will run approximately 2.5 hours starting at 6:30PM.  Per all our Meetups each photographer will have focused time with the models. This means that no other photographer will be permitted to shoot while you are shooting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Your Paypal payment must be received with your RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich&lt;br /&gt;richard@thedustynegative.com&lt;br /&gt;617-680-0450&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich</member_name><member_id>9500088</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1264894660000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Studio Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Greater-Boston-Studio-Photography</urlname><id>1454286</id><group_lat>42.4900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2799987793</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Studio &amp; Glamour Photography</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264432142000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Intimate Night with Kel</name><id>12416328</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264721400000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Studio-Photography/events/12416328/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/6/global_9781766.jpeg</photo_url></item>
