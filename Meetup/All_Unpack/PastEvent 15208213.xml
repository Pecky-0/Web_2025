Its been ages since we've been to Cuban Revolution downtown, so here we go! Cuban Revolution offers a spirited counter-culture environment reminiscent of a 1960s coffee house with the passion of a Latin beat... all wrapped up in a swanky setting that propels you back in time. The location downtown is a little cozier than the one over in Olneyville, but perfect for a Monday night! Its been awhile so, let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Bonnie is hosting this one, please look at her picture!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288910529000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287890467000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday Night Meetup - Cuban Revolution (downtown)!</name><id>15208213</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288648800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/15208213/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/7/e/global_8277966.jpeg</photo_url></item>
