If you get there by 9, you won't miss any of the music.  I'll be there earlier, regardless.  Maybe this will work out better for the Wright's Chicken people who will be out earlier in the evening.  Hope some of you can make it!  I guarantee that you'll enjoy the music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to be there by 8:30 so that I can get at least one table for us.  Vincent's is a small, unique place with a lot of character.  There is nothing flashy or trendy about it - it's just a cool place to have a drink and enjoy live music.  There is no cover charge for the band, but they &amp;quot;pass the bucket&amp;quot; in between sets.  Throw in a 5 dollar bill and you just got the best music deal of the night!  John and the boys will appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know more about the band, go to www.johncate.com.  You can download a few of the songs for a taste of what they sound like, but live they sound even better.  The guitar and fiddle solos are longer and the sound is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a meetup sign - it will most likely be at or near the corner of the bar just as you walk in the entrance.  If I can get a table or two, you'll see the sign on one of the tables to the left.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205947340000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>Those of you who saw John play at Nick's last month all enjoyed the band, so if you didn't see them last time - now's your chance!</why><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204647869000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The John Cate Band - Live at Vincent's in Worcester</name><id>7461951</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205629200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/7461951/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/9/f/global_3395535.jpeg</photo_url></item>
