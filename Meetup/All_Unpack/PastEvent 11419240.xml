We will go to MIT museum at 12:30 a.m. and then to Chain Reaction at Rockwell Cage at 2 p.m. You can buy your tickets to Museum and Chain Reaction at Museum for $10. Be sure to ask for that ticket and you will get a wristband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FAT Chain Reaction is an event at MIT on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Basically, everyone constructs a miniature Chain Reaction (like the game mousetrap) and then we link them all together and run the gigantic chain reaction. It is an awesome event. Last year we watched. This year, I would have liked to build something but time constraints did not make that possible. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am still going to the event to be a spectator. The event runs from 1-4. People are setting up from morning until the running of the event so it give us time to look at their contraptions up close. In addition, a ticket to the event gives you admission to the MIT museum that is a five minute walk down the street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am thinking we can meet at noon and perhaps grab a bite to eat. Then pay our admission, go the MIT museum and then go back to the event, peruse the contraptions and then grab seats in the stands for when they run the chain reaction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $10 per adults and $5 for children under 18, students and seniors.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Giovanni</member_name><member_id>2402708</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>24</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259514829000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253462761000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FAT Chain Reaction</name><id>11419240</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259341200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11419240/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/4/global_8362388.jpeg</photo_url></item>
