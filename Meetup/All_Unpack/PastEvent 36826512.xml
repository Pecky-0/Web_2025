On the one hand, government and big business continue to promote globalization and the consolidation of corporate power. At the same time, all around the world people are resisting those policies, demanding a re-regulation of trade and finance&amp;mdash;and, far from the old institutions of power, they&amp;rsquo;re starting to forge a very different future. Communities are coming together to re-build more human scale, ecological economies based on a new paradigm &amp;mdash; an economics of localization. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 The good news is that as we move in this direction we will begin not only to heal the earth but also to restore our own sense of well-being. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Economics of Happiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; restores our faith in humanity and challenges us to believe that it is possible to build a better world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have ever walked out of a movie theater affected by a powerful film, movie nights at the Center of Light are for you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;We are looking forward to seeing you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319997998000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318260613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie October - The Economics of Happiness</name><id>36826512</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319929200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/36826512/</event_url></item>
