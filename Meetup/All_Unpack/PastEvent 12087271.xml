<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The concepts of the self and its denial or abnegation are central in both Eastern and Western philosophy. We will engage in a comparative discussion of some of the major perspectives in both traditions. Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were influenced by Vedic philosophy, and Nietzsche’s rejection of absolute dualisms, if it was not actually inspired by Lao-tzu is in important respects complementary. Indeed, the dualism of Self and Other--perhaps the most basic of all dualisms--is arguable. Are Self/Other and Self/Selflessness illusory disctinctions? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key issues will be broadly considered and could range from Ayn Rand’s “virtue of selfishness” to Buddhism’s transcendence of the self. What is the basis of morality? Ego and selflessness may both play a role. What do you think? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of reincarnation, which is pervasive in Eastern religious and philosophical traditions but also common in the Western traditions may have important implications for our discussion. What is the relationship between soul and self? And what are the ethical implications of beliefs concerning the existence or nonexistence of the soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eastern and Western philosophers and philosophy aficionados of all persuasions are welcome! This meetup is a joint presentation of Boston Area Philosophy Discussions and the &lt;a href="http://buddhism.meetup.com/625/"&gt;Eastern Philosophy Group&lt;/a&gt;. There will be an introductory talk of ten to fifteen minutes and then we will launch into the discussion. At the end of the meeting we’ll have the opportunity to continue the conversation at a local restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the guy in the picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264983340000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260849900000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Self and Selfless: East/West Perspectives </name><id>12087271</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264809600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/events/12087271/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/6/global_7925510.jpeg</photo_url></item>
