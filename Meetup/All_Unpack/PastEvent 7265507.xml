This Tuesday, voters in two dozen states will&lt;br /&gt;determine whether 2009 ushers in a new era of limited government and&lt;br /&gt;peace, or whether one of two brands of tyranny will engulf this country,&lt;br /&gt;ushering in a new era of terror, poverty and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stand at the edge of the abyss, and on Tuesday, those people will&lt;br /&gt;push us over, or pull us back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for certain: on Tuesday, we are going to eat, drink and be&lt;br /&gt;merry, and you are welcome to join us. Come for dinner anytime after 5&lt;br /&gt;pm,  socialize with your fellow freedom lovers, watch the results come&lt;br /&gt;in on the huge projection TV, and stay for as long as you care to (or&lt;br /&gt;until Nanny State says you have to go home).&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203536080000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1202181366000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Super Taproom Tuesday</name><id>7265507</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1202248800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/7265507/</event_url></item>
