A new restaurant will be picked every week, so please make sure to check the location. Also please only respond to this event with a yes if you are sure you can go. Also do to the fact that I have to make a reservation for this event, if the meet up que is full, and you decide to show up to the event, please keep in mind that we did not anticipate you and might not be able to accommodate you if the restaurant is busy. To avoid any issues like this, please email me if you cannot sign up and I will add you to the list on my end and also contact the restaurant to make sure they can accommodate more people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if anyone has suggestions for places they would like to go in future events please either email me, or write your suggestions down and bring them with you to the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week I have decided to pick the restaurant, Daedalus.  The food here has been rated excellent and I think it will be a great opportunity for us to try it out.  Also please remember to only respond if you are coming. Also for this restaurant please try to be on time if possible.  They require everyone in the party to be present before they will seat you.  So if everyone is not at the restaurant by the latest 7, we will assume those who are not present are not coming.  I look forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I should have a sign with me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brent</member_name><member_id>6258711</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246055655000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Japanese/English Speakers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>boston-japanese</urlname><id>86694</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Boston Japanese &amp; English Language Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245690839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Restaurant Sampling</name><id>10708163</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245882600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-japanese/events/10708163/</event_url></item>
