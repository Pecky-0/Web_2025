It's called &amp;quot;GO&amp;quot; and it's better than many of the other games out there.  Why?  Because it is deceptively simple to learn and as you play it becomes more robust and complex.  GO never gets old.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for an Introductory evening with the Massachusetts GO Association.  It is free to attend, but we do need an RSVP so they know how many experienced players to have on tap for us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private club, new game - what could be better?&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go into the door where the stairs go down-door is on the right.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelle Sparta</member_name><member_id>1953058</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239839797000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238070657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beginner's Night at the Davis Square GO Club</name><id>10040212</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1239145200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/10040212/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
