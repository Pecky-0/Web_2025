This week has flown by, and I haven't climbed since Sunday.  I can't wait for tomorrow, so I'm going today.

I'll be hitting Metro Rock by 7pm at the latest. I might be at the table, but more likely I'll be climbing already.  See you there?




Let's climb!

Please note, you will need to pass a belay test if you are an experienced climber but new to the gym. You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. For more information see:

The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car.</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me in a grey shirt that reads "Making Democracy Happpen!"[sic] on back</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215903918000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215708723000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WTF it's Thursday already?!!</name><id>8314774</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215730800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8314774/</event_url></item>
