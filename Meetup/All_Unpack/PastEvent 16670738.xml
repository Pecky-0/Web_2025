&lt;p&gt;As I hear of things that might be interesting to Collective members, I will post them. I can't make all events, but if you are interested in hosting, please say so in your RSVP - its easy and fun - really!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that attended last month's Pecha Kucha at the RISD Artisan Cafe, you will remember that due to weather, it was rescheduled on a Monday night and we were able to make it our Monday Night Meetup. This month's Pecha Kucha is being held on its usual date of the last Wednesday of every month and this month its being held at AS220. AS220 is well equiped with a great bar and also some great home-cooked food (so its a good one to know about). If you liked the Pecha Kucha last month, here's ypur chance to check it out again tonight!&lt;/p&gt;
