You are welcome to bring guests, food, beer, and games to play! I will have two large tables and, if need be, a smaller table for some two player games. Beverages will be provided (water, soda, etc) and some snacks will be on hand. Chip in for lunch and dinner and I can order pizza or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games I am personally hoping to get to the table are 7 wonders, Show Manager, Carson City, possibly Power Boats, Nefarious (if it arrives on time), and Rex (if it arrives on time). I am open to play whatever though as I am sure others would be too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you can make it for some good gaming!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335712946000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup</urlname><id>1400736</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Concord, NH Boardgame Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335282319000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Gaming in Laconia</name><id>61917722</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335708000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Concord-NH-Boardgame-Meetup/events/61917722/</event_url></item>
