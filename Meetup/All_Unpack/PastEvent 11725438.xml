And if you're like most scooterists, your second love is talking about riding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it's December and it's cold. The scooter is probably garaged for the winter.

Is there a place you would love to go on your scooter with 5-10 (or 20??!) of your scooter friends?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come share a breakfast and tell us about it. If it makes you feel better, bring your helmet to put on the table, even if you drive the car.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll bring my helmet.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260886052000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256671712000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>OK, so it's December and it's cold.
