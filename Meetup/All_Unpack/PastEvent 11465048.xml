They have a great brunch, Ann Marie and I tried it last Sunday (yum!).  We thought we would make it around 11 so that it really is a &amp;quot;brunch&amp;quot;.   Hope to see some of you there!  &lt;br /&gt;directions to the Common Man:  Route 93 to exit 3, take a right off the exit, go to the end and turn right at the lights (route 111A)...  Common Man is about 1 mile down on 111A.   Just ask for Ann Marie's group.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for Ann Marie's table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260825593000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253897399000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunch at the Common Man</name><id>11465048</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257091200000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/11465048/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/a/global_9525242.jpeg</photo_url></item>
