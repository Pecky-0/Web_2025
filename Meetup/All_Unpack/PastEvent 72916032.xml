&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forest Hills Educational Trust is pleased to announce that the 14th annual Lantern Festival will be held on Thursday, July 12th (raindate: July 19). A much-loved community event for Jamaica Plain, as well as Greater Boston, the Lantern Festival draws its inspiration from the Japanese Bon Festival -- a celebration each year when a door opens to the world of their ancestors allowing loved ones to send messages to the other side. It is a time when neighbors come together to share stories, celebrate, and honor the memories of loved ones. Enjoy traditional Japanese dance from students of Showa Boston, Irish music from guitar and fiddle duo the Whiskey Boys, Chinese dragon dance from Gund Kwok and Grand Master Tsuji's Taiko drummers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Smitha</member_name><member_id>1020284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342186199000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>World Music Fans</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonWorldMusic</urlname><id>575464</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston World Music Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342029077000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>14th annual Forest Hills Lantern Festival</name><id>72916032</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342130400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWorldMusic/events/72916032/</event_url></item>
