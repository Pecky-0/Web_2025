Set-up is around 5pm for those of you who can make it and the game starts at 5:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Since I needed to buy a new net for our season, there is a $10 fee (1 time fee) to play.  With Sarah's net and the new one, we now have two.  We often had two games going at once last year with the great turnout of players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Remember that it is RECREATIONAL volleyball and people of all levels are welcome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all there.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lori&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for the net</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285880285000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279736402000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beach Volleyball</name><id>wpjpnynmbmc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285795800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/14170816/</event_url></item>
