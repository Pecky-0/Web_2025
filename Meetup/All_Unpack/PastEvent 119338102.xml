 Buck Hill Management Area is a 1,800 acre forest in the northwest corner of Rhode Island. The trails are a mix of single-track woodland trails and old farm roads. This is a six-mile hike that will take us past ponds, grain fields, and eventually to the Tri-State Marker where Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut meet. The hike should take about 2.5 hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the length of the hike, be sure to bring adequate water and snacks. We'll take a break at the Tri-State Marker. With the rocky trails we will be hiking, a pair of hiking boots is strongly suggested. The length of the hike, and the planned quick pace earn it an overall rating of difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a beginner hike, and is one of the longer Weber hikes. It is intended for those members with a good level of physical fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second Weber hike, Sprague Farm may be scheduled to follow this hike. Please answer the question on also attending that hike. People attending this hike will be given priority on attending Sprague Farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Directions: &lt;br /&gt;

 From I-295, take Rt 44 west until you reach Chepachet. Bear right to take Rt 100 North continuing through Pascoag until you see Buck Hill Road veer off to the left. Once on Buck Hill Road, pay attention to your odometer as Wood Road is 2.2 miles down on the right. Some landmarks to indicate your getting close to Wood Road is you'll pass a fire tower, a sign for a BSA camp on the left, then a rifle range on the right before you see Wood Road. It is a gravel road and will be bumpy for that 0.3 miles. The sign for the Buck Hill area is not very obvious, so watch closely for it. &lt;br /&gt;
