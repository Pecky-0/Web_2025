The date of the Autumn Equinox corresponds to the center of the Sun crossing the celestial equator moving southward.  Night and day are nearly of the same length and it marks the first day of Autumn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditionally, this is a time when there is a harvest feast to celebrate and share the abundance of the past season. And a time when the plants are setting their seeds; making themselves ready for their new cycle. This ritual is all about harvesting ALL the Universe has waiting for you. And for assisting you to use this time to balance yourself and your life; setting yourself and your life to be ready for your new cycle of BE-ing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us this Sunday, Sept 27th, 6 - 9 pm&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;br /&gt;- bring a potluck “harvest” entrée to enjoy with others.  &lt;br /&gt;- Delight us with your &amp;quot;harvest&amp;quot; of what you’ve manifested this year.  &lt;br /&gt;- Share with us the key activities you do EVERY day to keep you energized and focused to deliberately bring in your harvest.  &lt;br /&gt;- We'll also share with you the top 5 daily activities that &amp;quot;master&amp;quot; manifestors do.  You'll have an an opportunity to do a practice run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you think about your life and what you're energizing every day, does it make you smile or is it time to make a shift?&lt;/b&gt;  Let’s celebrate and support each other to release and renew, to plant the seeds that bring you more of  the things you want into your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you, Heather L, for welcoming us to your home.  Heather will also lead us in fun, playful &amp;quot;percussion&amp;quot; activities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************************* &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring: a main entree to share.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll provide appetizers, salad, desserts and refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; ONLY if you know you are coming!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; &amp;amp; cost down, please RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; only when you can honor your commitment &amp;amp; be with us.
