Powder Mill features numerous coves to explore, an old railroad trestle, a wooden covered bridge, great bass fishing, an an entire fleet of Blue Herons! This shallow lake sees very little powerboat traffic, making it a great paddling destination. Powder Mill Pond is featured in the AMC's “Quiet Waters” paddling guide. While it is a bit of a drive to get there, it is New Hampshire's best kept paddling secret and the drive is well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For More Information About Powder Mill Pond:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/Fishing/bathy_maps/powdermill_hancock.pdf[/url" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [url=http://calmwaterpaddler.blogspot.com/2008/09/powder-mill-pond.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check out the photos I took on September 10th:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[IMG]&lt;a href="http://i866.photobucket.com/albums/ab230/steve6225/IMGP3369.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://i866.photobuck...&lt;/a&gt;[/IMG]&lt;br /&gt;[IMG]&lt;a href="http://i866.photobucket.com/albums/ab230/steve6225/IMGP3349.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://i866.photobuck...&lt;/a&gt;[/IMG]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paddle is open to all Kayak Types as well as Canoes and will be 10-11 miles in length.
