<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's get together to put together a meetup for all those Puggies who live south of Boston.  For this first meeting, I will volunteer my fenced yard in Brockton, MA (don't worry, it's a perfectly safe neighborhood of single family homes!), and we can discuss locations for future meetings.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll provide biscuits (Old Mother Hubbard, my favorite! sez Clovis) and water for the puggies and coffee and donuts for the Pugaholics.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs.  If you have a bully on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him.  We want everyone to have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions about your organizor, I've had Pugs since 1985.
