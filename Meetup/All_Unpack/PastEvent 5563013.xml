Good Soldiers&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, March 31  5 PM to 10 PM&lt;br /&gt;Hosted by A.V. Wright in the Arena&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four factions have braved the Well of Woe and the Mere of Shattered&lt;br /&gt;Souls. Now they split apart again, each seeking keys to the next part&lt;br /&gt;of the draconic prophecies held in the Caldyn Fragments.&lt;br /&gt;The Covenant of Light is determined not to let the power of the Caldyn&lt;br /&gt;Fragments fall into the wrong hands. But as more and more evidence&lt;br /&gt;comes to light of corruption within their own ranks, it becomes&lt;br /&gt;difficult to be certain of whose hands those are. When adventure comes&lt;br /&gt;seeking them, will they be able to bring the light into the darkness&lt;br /&gt;once more?&lt;br /&gt;A Xen'drik Expeditions adventure for Covenant of Light characters&lt;br /&gt;only.
