<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>So back in Wisconsin I was a regular at a local cover band - I used to go out dancing every Tuesday night.  And when I talk dancing, I don't mean the skeezy bump and grind, but I mean full-on dancing-home-in-front-of-the-mirror karaaaaazy dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, though this is not a live-music dancing venue, it &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt; a kickin' rad place to get your 80s grooves on!  No better workout, no better way to blow off steam, and no better way to ramp you up for the weekend than throwin down and rockin out on a Thursday night.  This will hopefully be one of many dance outings to come, so let's show this city what we're made of!  The bar serves food till 11, too, so if you work up an appetite there'll be plenty to nosh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***note - there may be a small cover here - something in the way of $4/$5.  because we're getting there on the early side we may not have to pay at all, but i would bring some extra cash just in case!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP for details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242676210000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240358021000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>80s Night at the Common Ground in Allston</name><id>10237896</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242349200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10237896/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/4/9/global_8281609.jpeg</photo_url></item>
