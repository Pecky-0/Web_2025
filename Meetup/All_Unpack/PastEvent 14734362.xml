I am picking pizza as its an inexpensive dinner for all. The park will be nice as members can come later still grab a bite and hang out even if only for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;I will be holding a white piece of paper folded that has the RSVP list so I can attempt to remember names.... I will email the RSVP list my cell number that way if it's raining etc we can communicate if needed. I'll think of a place for pizza that we can go to if the weather is bad.  Hope some of you can make it and if it works out we can it or similar every couple weeks. I look forward to meeting some of you and although my language skills are not very good I will do my best to be a good host to our members from far away places!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinocchio's Pizza &amp;amp; Subs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pinocchios...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>see description</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ziggy R</member_name><member_id>10747159</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284519182000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>English Students &amp; Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>esl-76</urlname><id>55264</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston English as a Second Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284223388000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meeting in Harvard Sq and eat in the Park and chat</name><id>14734362</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284498000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/esl-76/events/14734362/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/0/2/global_17858306.jpeg</photo_url></item>
