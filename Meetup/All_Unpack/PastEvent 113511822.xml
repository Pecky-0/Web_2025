We will have space reserved for us at the Mass Ave. Tavern. The Tavern has board game nights every Tuesday and has a collection of board games available for guests to play. I will bring games too. Feel free to bring your favorite board or card games with you. This will be a great night, so be sure to join us! Each guest is responsible for the cost of their own food/drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note: It is important that we have an accurate headcount, so only sign up if you can definitely attend. If your plans change, be sure to update your RSVP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo) at our tables.
