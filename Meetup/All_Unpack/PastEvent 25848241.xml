This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is:&amp;nbsp;Sakis Pizza&amp;nbsp;-downtown on Waybosset Street near Gourmet Heaven and across the street from Johnson &amp;amp; Wales! One block&amp;nbsp;south from Grants Block and Tazza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So,&amp;nbsp;I've heard alot about this places from various people.&amp;nbsp;Recently renovated, Sakis is a pizza place downstairs&amp;nbsp;with a nice, large and &amp;nbsp;well-stocked balcony&amp;nbsp;bar upstairs which looks out to the street and over the restaurant. I've read that the pizza is good, and the&amp;nbsp;reviews from some discerning P-Collective members are in. It seems like a good place to know about and its been requested.&amp;nbsp;So&amp;nbsp;let's check it out!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE RSVP - I need to tell them we're coming the Friday before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be upstairs wearing a silver flower, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
