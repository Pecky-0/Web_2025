Architecture students from the BAC and from MIT discuss how in partnership they designed, developed, funded, constructed and ran a zero-energy solar house on the Washington Mall to compete in the US Department of Energy's 2007 Solar Decathlon. Now these student designer-builders talk about that experience, what they learned that you can profit from, and what comes next for them and for architecture in New England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a session at the BSA's Residential Design &amp;amp; Construction conference.&lt;/b&gt; The cost is $10. You can preregister or pay at the door. Please read below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are already registered to attend the conference, please call 1-800-544-1898 and tell them to add this event to your registration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are not already registered for RDC and would like to attend, you can register at www.rdcboston.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are not planning to attend any other sessions at RDC, but you want to register for this event or another evening event &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;, you can register as a &amp;quot;member of the public&amp;quot; at the door to avoid the exhibit hall fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207346962000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Design Build Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonarchitects</urlname><id>696342</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Architecture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206565212000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MIT Solar 7 House - the next generation of solar designers</name><id>7608510</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207173600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonarchitects/events/7608510/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/4/a/global_3611450.jpeg</photo_url></item>
