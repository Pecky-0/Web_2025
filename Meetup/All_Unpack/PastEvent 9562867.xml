The original 1980 movie, directed by Sean S. Cunningham is widely acclaimed for its horrifying and creative murder sequences. The well known character of Jason Voorhees only had a small part in the film, but New Line Cinema's new Version is said to substantially expand on his character and backstory.

Terror and suspense abound in this 24-hour nightmare of blood. Camp Crystal Lake has been shuttered for over 20 years due to several vicious and unsolved murders. The camp's new owner and seven young counselors are readying the property for re-opening despite warnings of a "death curse" by local residents. The curse proves true on Friday the 13th as one by one each of the counselors is stalked by a violent killer.
