<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Unfortunately, due to conflicts at Off The Leash, &lt;b&gt;we will have to cancel our August meetup!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added a September meetup to the calendar.  Hope to see you there!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many apologies, &lt;br /&gt;Emily &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important: Please keep in mind that the health of our small dog friends is one of our top priorities. When dogs play together, it is very important that each dog is current on all of their vaccinations. These vaccinations include: DHLPP, Bordatella (canine cough) and Rabies. Please ensure that your dog is current on all vaccinations before coming to the meet ups!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily McHugh </member_name><member_id>6348089</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222015283000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>small Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>smallbreeddogs-41</urlname><id>404601</id><group_lat>41.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>The North Attleboro Small Breed Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214942822000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cancelled: August Small Doggie Meetup...</name><id>8256467</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218999600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/smallbreeddogs-41/events/8256467/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/c/global_1388764.jpeg</photo_url></item>
