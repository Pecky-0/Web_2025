We copy the Sutra and Odaimoku (Sacred Title) as a form of meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly Sutra copying (Shakyo) and Buddhist image copying (Shabutsu) are held once a month.  Ryuoh Shonin also will teach Buddhist Icon painting to those who would like to learn. No prior experience in calligraphy or art is necessary. The practice begins with purification and silent meditation to still the mind. The brush is then used to focus our attention and center our minds. At the end of the session a dedication is read. The practice usually last about two hours and can be continued the following class. We have practice materials available but will be asking that each person consider making a contribution to cover the cost of paper, brushes, pens and ink. If you have an interest in this specific practice please join us.&lt;/p&gt;
