Please schedule some time this month to attend at least one canvassing event. The sooner we get done in Nashua, the sooner we can move on and spread the word to another town. If you do not know how to canvass, don't worry, we'll show you everything you need to know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need both drivers and canvassers. Typically we like to have two canvassers and one driver per team.  It takes about 2-3 hours for a team to complete one packet depending on how close the houses are.  When you RSVP, please indicate whether you would like to be a canvasser or driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193159318000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191875251000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canvassing in Nashua</name><id>6512983</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192986000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6512983/</event_url></item>
