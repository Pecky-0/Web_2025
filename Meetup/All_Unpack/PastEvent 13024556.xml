To the West, Monadnock frames the horizon. To the north, you might see Crotched Mountain and a glimpse of the White Mountains. To the south, Watatic and Wachusett. We will take the Cliff Trail that brings us by some incredible talus rock cliff area and then to the top of the North peak. We will return by the ridge trail. This will be a beginners /moderate hike that we will be taking at a slow pace . &lt;br /&gt;Distance ... 4 miles &lt;br /&gt;Length.. 5 1/2 hours &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option would be car spotting at Miller State Park then starting at the north trail head off of Old Mountain road and traversing back to Miller State Park where our cars will be awaiting for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W&amp;#9632;From Manchester, the Seacoast, Nashua, Concord, and other points north and east, head west on NH-101 (from NH-101 in Manchester or NH-101 in Nashua) past Milford towards Peterborough.
