Do you like to socialize and network? Well the South Shore Dinning Meetup Group would like to give us all an opportunity to relax and have some fun.  Our group is diverse, talkative, and very upbeat.  Come out and see what its all about at The Cheesecake Factory at South Shore Plaza from 6-7:30pm.  This meetup is a little different than most of our meetups.  Since this is an appetizer social and we will be in the bar area, you are free to stop-in anytime during the times listed.  If we're having fun we may stay later!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of our organizers (Susan, Estella) will be there shortly before the start of the event to secure a bar table or two depending on the number of people planning to attend.  We look forward to meeting all of you, enjoying some appetizers and drinks, and good conversation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appetizer Social Meetup!&lt;br /&gt;The Cheesecake Factory&lt;br /&gt;250 Granite Street/Route 37&lt;br /&gt;South Shore Plaza&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184&lt;br /&gt;781-843-1007&lt;br /&gt;6-7:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $2pp &lt;br /&gt;Min/Max: No maximum at this time. &lt;br /&gt;Guests: Bring yourself and a guest or 2....&lt;br /&gt;Accessibility: This is handicap-accessible.&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: Wednesday, February 6th @ 12noon&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizers: Estella and Susan &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember:  Please bring cash.
