<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;I spoke with Bob Adelizzi, we can put together a trip to TRACON in a few weeks for a Monday night. Seats are limited at this time though. If there is more interest than seats, we can ask for two trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did this a couple of years ago and it was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It's about an hour drive and we should be there around 6:30. I say we leave and have dinner first near TRACON. Can we leave at 4:30 or so?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob added, &amp;quot;We'll need their names. They have to be US citizens, and will need a photo ID for the security people.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please respond and answer the questions. We may have to drive there and car pool. It's in Merrimac NH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting look into how ATC works... &lt;br /&gt;Get ready for this rare look inside a state of the art ATC facility. Learn how to fly safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank Bob for your help with this, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285089546000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283876117000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trip to TRACON</name><id>14684254</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285014600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/14684254/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/5/d/global_17783725.jpeg</photo_url></item>
