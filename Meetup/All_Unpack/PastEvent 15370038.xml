But Rat Girl is also a startlingly funny and touching memoir of her mid-Eighties moment as the bi- polar, pregnant, intermittently homeless frontwoman of a rising indie-rock band. It's a gripping journey into mental chaos and out the other side.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Simon Reynolds, author of Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-84&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Like Michael Azerrad’s classic “Our Band Could Be Your Life,” “Rat Girl” reveals the inspiring camaraderie at the heart of ’80s indie rock. These kids took care of one another because they knew nobody else would.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rob Sheffield, New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>sellingsanctuary</member_name><member_id>3325851</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289488934000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289159797000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kristin Hersh reads and performs music from Rat Girl </name><id>15370038</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289433600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/15370038/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
