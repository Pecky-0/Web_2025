It's a relatively small place and being that I'll be wearing a Brewers Jersey I should be easy to pick out of a crowd. After a quick lunch we'll head over to the AMC Theatre next to Boston Common. If you don't want to meet up for lunch no worries I'll be in the lobby until 11:45 ish before heading upstairs to the movie. It's been a while so it will be nice to meet up with those that I haven't seen in a while. See you there! Russ
