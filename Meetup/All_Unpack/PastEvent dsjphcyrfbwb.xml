Why is it relevant to our spiritual lives? “In Japan we have the phrase shoshin, which means “beginner’s mind... The goal of practice is always to keep our beginner’s mind…If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s there are few.” Likewise, the great teacher Honen taught, that a person of the path attains birth in the Pure Land (Nirvana) by returning to her foolish self.
