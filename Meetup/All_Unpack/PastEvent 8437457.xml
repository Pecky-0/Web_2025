If you dont know what that means, no worries just think of the television show, Who's Line Is It Anyway. And if you haven't seen that, just know that we'll make you laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following our performance, see if you have what it takes to be an improv comedian in IMPROV SURVIVOR! Open to anyone, we'll ask for volunteers from the audience to join up with some of the Lost Marbles troupe on stage. We'll form teams and you'll try out some of the games you've just seen. The rest of the audience will play judge and jury and declare a winner but no losers by the night is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invite all your friends to tag along with you for a wicked funny time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission: $10 at the door (cash only please)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details on being part of&lt;br /&gt;IMPROV SURVIVOR! contact Bob Gautreau at&lt;br /&gt;781-224-3363&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy Blackman</member_name><member_id>4979909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218234581000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217371039000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Performance!
