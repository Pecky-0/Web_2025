&lt;p&gt;Bicycles Battling Cancer event is set to take place on Sunday, June 10, 2012, with a start/finish line at the Bolton Fairgrounds in Lancaster, MA, and the goal for this year is to engage 500 riders and raise over $500,000 for the fight against cancer. Each rider makes a fundraising commitment of $300, and receives an event jersey for raising $500 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds raised through Bicycles Battling Cancer support the American Cancer Society's life saving mission of creating a world with less cancer and more birthdays!
