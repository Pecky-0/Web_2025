So from 7:30 to 8:00 will be open and social! Hanging out chit chatting will be encouraged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The from 8:00 to 9:00 we will have a more organized agenda. A topic, a presentation, a group sharing of images, something related to Photography!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then from 9 to 9:30 We will hang out again catching up with folks from that evenings topic. We'll clean up and head out by 9:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky or ridged just a but more &amp;quot;photo related&amp;quot; verses &amp;quot;social party&amp;quot; ... folks have told me they come here to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this months discussion topic is Grab Shots. Shots you took in a split second without any set up or warning. Maybe you took them with your phone, maybe you just happen to have your camera and caught something unexpected. Share your image, share your story... Let's discuss the beauty of a capture moment - a decisive moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The decisive moment, it is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as the precise organization of forms which gives that event its proper expression.&amp;quot; - Henri Cartier-Bresson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going forward we will be asking for a donation at the meetups of $5.00 to cover costs. However it's not manditory to attend - just please donate if you can... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, &lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1265031337000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258753140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Photo MeetUp</name><id>11921913</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264725000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/11921913/</event_url></item>
