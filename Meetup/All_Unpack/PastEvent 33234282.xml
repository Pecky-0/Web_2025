&lt;p&gt;From the Trustees website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a picnic lunch and explore Choate Island in Essex Bay with your family. Choate Island, part of the Crane Wildlife Refuge, is home to a variety of plant and animal life. It is also the site of the Choate family homestead, the Proctor Barn, the White Cottage, and the final resting place of Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Crane. Boat transportation will be provided to and from Choate Island from the Crane Beach parking lot. Crane Estate staff and volunteers will be on hand to answer your island questions, lead walks along its many grassy footpaths, and give tours of its unique historic structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-registration suggested - via email or phone - the trustees of reservations-&lt;/p&gt;
