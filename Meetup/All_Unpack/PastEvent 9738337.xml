We hear some of them might even be funny.  If not, don't worry... There will be copious amounts of beer, so you won't know the difference.  At only five dollars, what do you have to lose (besides the five dollars, of course)?  - Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam is actually hosting the Thursday meetups, so look for him, not me.  If you don't show up his ego will be bruised forever and he'll need therapy, which I don't provide for free.  So in support of his mental health, I think you should attend.
