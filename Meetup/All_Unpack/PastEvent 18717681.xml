In this  workshop, you'll learn how to identify  these plants, which parts are  edible, how to harvest them, and how to  use them in meals.&amp;nbsp; Recipes  will be provided.&amp;nbsp; We'll also be able to  harvest some and take them  home, so you can have sensory experiences of  how they look, feel, and  smell, and direct&amp;nbsp; hands-on experience of  harvesting, preparing, and  eating them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The phragmites are past harvest time, but I'll show you the plant,  as well as demonstrate how to harvest cattail shoots, which are similar  in harvest method, taste, and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;cost: $10 - 20 sliding scale &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;bring- waterproof boots, small knife or cutting instrument, bag or other container for harvest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want to taste these plants in the field, bring a gallon of potable water so you can rinse them off.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>call 617-492-2340 for info</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>HJ</member_name><member_id>13327790</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306213444000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RawBoston</urlname><id>733136</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Raw Food Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1305655930000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harvest Invasives- postponed from May 15</name><id>18717681</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306090800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RawBoston/events/18717681/</event_url></item>
