<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000 ; font-size : large"&gt;It will be hot tomorrow,  so bring enough drinks to keep yourself hydrated.  Also, parking will be tight. If you know other hikers and can coordinate carpools from the ski lodge perhaps, that would be great. There is an event at the lodge from 8-10 so maybe parking on the end of the parking lot? And have a flashlight or headlamp with you for the hike down in case the moon isn't bright enough!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there was so much demand to join the August 1st sunset/moonrise hike, I've decided to do this again! Luckily for us, August 31st provides us another opportunity to have a sunset and a moonrise within a short time of each other!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;Details finally!  Sunset is listed as 7:21pm and moonrise (full moon) is listed as 7:05pm. These earlier times necessitated the start time changing to 5:30 rather than 6:00. I hope this still works for everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;We will still be meeting at Stagecoach Trail trailhead on Westminster Road, BUT....  We well take the Echo Lake Trail to the High Meadow Trail. Then we will take the Jack Frost Trail to the Mountain House Trail, finally reaching the summit. We will not be attempting to set any records on this hike as I enjoy a meander rather than a gallop! &lt;span style="color : #ff0000 ; font-size : large"&gt;Parking will be tight, so squeeze in along the road as best you can!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: Another meetup group is meeting at the same spot at the same time. I am almost certain they will be taking the Administration Road as their trail initially. We may see them again as they zig zag over to the Mountain House Trail towards the summit.  The two groups have between us, about 55 hikers. If we all took the same trail, it could get a bit congested. Therefore we are utilizing a different trail!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;Bring: Beverage, snacks, bug spray, maybe a windbreaker, a camera if you wish, and a headlamp or flashlight if more light is needed for the hike down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Terry Rooney</member_name><member_id>43555442</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346503708000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>45</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343172310000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A sunset \/ moonrise hike...
