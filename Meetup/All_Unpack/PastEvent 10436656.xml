With a promotion up in the air between her and another employee her boss says she needs to demonstrate she can make the hard calls. When Mrs. Ganush, an elderly Slavic woman, ask for a second extension on her mortgage Christine denies her in an attempt to prove herself. In desperation, Ganush prostrates herself before Christine, begging and kissing the hem of her skirt. As a crowd of customers and employees gathers, Christine panics and shoves the woman away, gravely insulting her. That night, Ganush, enraged and humiliated, exacts revenge by placing a curse upon Christine. Christine learns from a psychic that she is to be tortured for three days by a Lamia before being dragged to hell to burn for eternity.
