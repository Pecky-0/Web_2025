Just about anything! During the wild, sleepless weekend of May 5th, over a thousand Boston-area filmmakers wrote, shot, edited, and scored 100 short films. From scratch. In 48 hours. Come see the best of their labors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be twelve 7-minute shorts, with the awards--including Best Edited and Best Film of the Boston 48HFP--announced at the end. The judges are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Keough, Film Editor for the Boston Phoenix, Wesley Morris, Film Critic for the Boston Globe, and our own Thelma Schoonmaker, this year?s Coolidge Award winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comedy, horror, adventure, romance! You'll see it all with the filmmakers themselves in attendance. The finalists will also be available for viewing on Coolidge on Demand on June 11th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official site: &lt;a href="http://www.48hourfilm.com/boston" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.48hourfilm...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will be hosted by Nicole, who will be holding a meetup sign at the front of the theater when the panel is over. After the talk we'll head off to JP Licks for ice cream and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541506000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1180461618000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Best of the 48 Hour Film Festival</name><id>5828690</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181257200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5828690/</event_url></item>
