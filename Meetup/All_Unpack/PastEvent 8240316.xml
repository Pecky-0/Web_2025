<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>If the weather cooperates we would like to get to the Hatch Shell around 4 pm to park on Storrow Drive and get a good spot on the Esplanade! If anyone wants to carpool from Dedham let me know! Also, we usually bring snacks to share! So,we will have a Meet-up sign and will sit to the right of the stage (if you are facing the stage) as close to the front as possible! I will have my cellphone on which is 617-699-3305. if the weather is really bad, we can discuss around 2 and I will post a cancellation! Don't forget to bring a chair!
