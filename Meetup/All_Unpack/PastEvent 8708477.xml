Since Happy Hour's always seem to be a hit, we thought we could do another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian's is right by Fenway, and since we will have a large group it will be a great spot. We will officially start at 7:30, but as always feel free to come when you please! Brad &amp;amp; I will be there around 7:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Corinne &amp;amp; Brad&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be on the 2nd floor near the pool tables,</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>22</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247452809000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>47</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220811702000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Happy Hour!</name><id>8708477</id><headcount>49</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224891000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/8708477/</event_url></item>
