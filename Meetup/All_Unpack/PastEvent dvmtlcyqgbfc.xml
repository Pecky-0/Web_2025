&lt;p&gt;If you've never climbed here before, you'll need to take &amp;amp; pass a belay test for rope climbing. If you are not confident you can tie a re-threaded figure-8 knot and double fisherman's backup knot and safely belay a climber using an ATC device, it is highly recommended you take the Level 1 Safety class. The gym will not allow you to climb on ropes without passing a belay test. Call MetroRock or see the website below for more info, and ask them about any discounts or special prices they are offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time driving here, it can be tricky to find MetroRock Everett. Use a GPS if possible. MetroRock is in a building opposite Boston Coach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toprope, sport leading, and bouldering available, including some tall walls up to 55 feet.&amp;nbsp; Whether you're a new or experienced climber, join us for a fun and solid workout!&amp;nbsp; Gym meetups are also a great way to make more friends for outdoor climbing.&amp;nbsp; If you'd like to lead climb, don't forget to bring your rope :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-access Day Pass $18. Bouldering-Only Pass $15. Mondays are Women's Night: Women's Pass $10.&amp;nbsp; More info and directions: &lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/"&gt;http://www.metrorock.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet UPSTAIRS in the lounge above the bouldering area (to make it easier to spot the group) from 7 - 7:10 PM.&amp;nbsp; If arriving later, just come find us on the walls.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully you can recognize me (see "Event Host") from my picture.&amp;nbsp; And/or check the small Whiteboard near the bathrooms and water fountain, for a description of what I'm wearing that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If interested in starting earlier, give us a heads up in your RSVP comment -- and to help us find and recognize you: Write your name &amp;amp; description on the Whiteboard and make sure you have a face picture posted on your profile.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet UPSTAIRS in the lounge above the bouldering area; Check the Whiteboard at the gym for a description of what our host is wearing (details below).</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brenda</member_name><member_id>4850804</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335226314000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334707952000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MetroRock Monday - meet UPSTAIRS over the bouldering area</name><id>dvmtlcyqgbfc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335222000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/61014262/</event_url></item>
