I want to see it before it disappears from the Boston movie scene. Here's what the theater's website -- &lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheaters.com/"&gt;http://www.landmarktheaters.com/&lt;/a&gt; --has to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;Juliette Binoche won the Best Actress prize in Cannes for her performance in this playful and provocative romantic drama from legendary auteur Abbas Kiarostami &lt;em&gt;(Taste of Cherry, The Wind Will Carry Us)&lt;/em&gt;, his first feature made outside of Iran. Binoche plays a gallery owner living in a Tuscan village who attends a lecture by a British author (opera star William Shimell) on authenticity and fakery in art. Afterward she invites him on a tour of the countryside during which he is mistaken for her husband. They keep up the pretence and continue on their afternoon out, discussing love, life and art, and increasingly behaving like a long-married couple. But are they play-acting on a whim or is there more to their seemingly new relationship than meets the eye?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at the theater's website, you can read Wesley Morris's review from the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;. Here's an excerpt from Morris's review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : x-small"&gt;. . . There&amp;rsquo;s a divinely comical lightness to Binoche here: Even in states of conniption and complaint, she&amp;rsquo;s floating, albeit manically. In her opening minutes with James, she goes on a bit nervously about the pieces in her shop and her sister and child. In a nanosecond, she goes from pointedly correcting him in a disagreement to sweetly inviting him into a museum to show him something special. . . . In fact, when She and He pop into the cafe of a sturdy Italian woman (Gianna Giachetti) and the woman assumes they are married, She doesn&amp;rsquo;t deny it, and, eventually, neither does He. From here, &amp;ldquo;Certified Copy&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; passes through the looking glass into a state of heightened ambiguity. Are these two for real with their arguments and reminiscences and intimacy? Is this their first date or 15th?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambiguity and mystery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie starts at 6:50 p.m. I will buy my ticket at 6:30 p.m., then wait by the foot of the staircase in the theater lobby. Look for my bright red backpack. I'll wait about 15 minutes, until 6:45, then go into the theater auditorium (must&amp;nbsp;see the previews). I'll linger a bit in the theater lobby after the movie (and most of the movie credits) so that anyone who is late can catch up with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll decide after the movie if we want to go to the Friendly Toast. (No decisions about where, just if, we will go after the movie.) I know I won't want to eat that late, and the&amp;nbsp;tea selection at the Friendly Toast is one of the best around. They serve meals, and you can eat if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at the Kendall!&lt;/p&gt;
