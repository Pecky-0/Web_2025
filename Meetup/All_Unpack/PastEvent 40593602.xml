<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Join us at our January meeting where we will be joined by&amp;nbsp;Jay Wexler. &amp;nbsp;Jay teaches at the Boston University School of Law. He studied religion at the University of Chicago Divinity School and law at Stanford, and worked as a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He has published numerous academic articles, and reviews, as well as over three dozen short stories and humor pieces in outlets such as The Boston Globe, Mental Floss, Spy and McSweeney's Internet Tendency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;Jay will be giving a talk on his book, "Holy Hullabaloos: A Road Trip to the Battlegrounds of the Church/State Wars" where Jay&amp;nbsp;takes a road trip to "meet the people and visit the places responsible for landmark decisions in recent judicial history, from a high school football field where fans once recited prayers before kickoff to a Santeria church notorious for animal sacrifice, from a publicly funded Muslim school to a creationist museum. Wexler's no-holds-barred approach to investigating famous church/state brouhahas is as funny as it is informative." (Amazon)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;As always, we will be setting up around 6:30, so feel free to come and socialize.&amp;nbsp;The program is scheduled to start at 7. &amp;nbsp;We are asking that&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;make a small $5 donation at the door. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
