The energy of fire, passion and transformation will be used to burn things that have to go and create space for things that have to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puja is a purging ceremony which is used to raise the spirit to Gods. In India, people burn herbs in temples, gradually chanting themselves to the expanded states of consciousness and bliss. In USA when we say puja we mean men and women working in two rotating circles. Come and see this beautiful sacred geometry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transformation is the topic of this tantric Puja. We will be working in an environment of a sealed circle of magick, doing tamtric meditations, exchanging energies, healings, songs, dances and prayers - to open ourselves as doors for the divine and celebrate this life full of laughter, raising ourselves from the ordinary dreams into extraordinary peace and magic. This event will be a mixed gender event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:30 - 10pm&lt;br /&gt;$15 Goddess Special&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 28 7:30&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luba Evans</member_name><member_id>7320465</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247096152000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Goddess</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>goddess-327</urlname><id>1289522</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Goddess Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241017995000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Saraswati Goddess Puja Festival</name><id>10294048</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243639800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/goddess-327/events/10294048/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/5/global_8407541.jpeg</photo_url></item>
