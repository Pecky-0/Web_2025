<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Before the holiday season parties get in full swing, lets start by getting in a festive mood with a &lt;strong&gt;Progressive dinner.&lt;/strong&gt;  Usually done in different homes in the same neighborhood, this will be in one place, but everyone can bring a different course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking so we can all sit comfortably, I'll have to limit it to 12 (as there are always last minute drop outs).  10 sit comfortably cozy in my dining room, but if there are 12, we'll be all the cozier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start about 1pm, so those of you that need to leave before dark, will have had plenty of time to eat and enjoy the afternoon.  However, as long as we hold out, I'm game to continue on til about 9pm, if desired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll plan for a yankee swap, after dinner but before dessert course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we had an After christmas RESWAP, that was lots of fun.  I'll leave that for the comments area, for those that sign up to decide if you prefer new or re-gifting practical things, that you just have no use for (doesn't fit decor, or your tastes, etc).  This is meant to be fun, not an expensive evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the main course you favor, (see options below) I'm going to provide and cook it, along with a wide selection of non-alcoholic beverages.  if you want something stronger, feel free to bring it.  There may be a minimal cost of $5. each, to offset the cost of this, but don't let that stop you.  It IS the season of giving, so if $ is not possible for you, be MY guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main Course Options are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)roast stuffed pork (bread stuffing),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)traditional roast pork, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)turkey dinner and all the fixings, but people may be sick of that.  I NEVER get sick of turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person that signs up can bring an appetizer, bread/bisquits/rolls, salad, soup, fruit, cheese or dessert course.  If you have something that you only make once a year (I make Canadian pork pie, also known as Tortierre, only for Christmas Eve), let me know and I'll try and fit it in with our dinner offerings.  Yes, with enough requests, I could be talked into making one for this dinner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sign up, please let me know your &lt;strong&gt;preference for main course, and what you are thinking of bringing. &lt;/strong&gt; Last minute changes will be fine, but hate to get all desserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever we eat, we are assured with our members that we will have a great time, lots of laughter, and probably too much food. Please sign up early, but only if you are serious about attending,   as this event is expected to be full quickly.  A wait list will also be set up, in case of cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets have some FUN!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>detail directions will be sent to YES responses 1 wk before event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria "GG"</member_name><member_id>8119518</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354565444000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351806067000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Progressive supper, and Yankee swap in Dracut, MA</name><id>89535182</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354384800000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/89535182/</event_url></item>
