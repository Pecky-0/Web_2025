I'm also planning some smaller Saturday hikes such as this one, meeting for a great breakfast at this very popular restaurant:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://villagepancakehouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://villagepancake...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one of these is for today at 9:30.  Following that, we will head over to Ipswich for a super hike and bird watch:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/Sanctuaries/Ipswich_River/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.massaudubo...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow an hour or so for breakfast - then we'll head up to Ipswich - and then estimate at least three hours for the hike which will be very leisurely and total around 5 miles.  If we wish to try some of the outer trails, add another hour or so and a couple of extra miles.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike and social is designed for those who enjoy smaller groups and who have a lot of leisurely time to spend outside, without a day end deadline in case we get lost (only kidding)!  I will look forward to seeing you then!  Bird watchers:  this is your day:) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com &lt;br /&gt;PS - If you sign up for this one, please be sure and change your RSVP on the waiting list for the earlier hikes, in order to give other members a chance to move up in the queue:)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Randy</member_name><member_id>10613717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>16</waitlist_count><updated>1277586334000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274181511000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Breakfast in Rowley and Hike in Ipswich!</name><id>13517586</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277559000000</time><rsvp_limit>9</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/13517586/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/d/global_6592605.jpeg</photo_url></item>
