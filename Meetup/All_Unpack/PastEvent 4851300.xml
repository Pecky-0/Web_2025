Do you want to know more about Plone, Zope, and Python?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and meet other Plone users and developers at the Boston Plone users group. We will gather monthly to talk about how we are using Plone, share knowledge and give demonstrations of cool Plone products. All skill levels are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have specific topics that you'd like to discuss, please post them in the discussion forum. (and yes, we will eventually move this over to a Plone site).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March Agenda: &lt;br /&gt;Curious what happened at the Plone Symposium in New Orleans? Seth Gottlieb and Nate Aune will be presenting a summary of the activities. We will also discuss ideas for the usergroup website and recruit volunteers to help represent Plone in the open source pavilion at the upcoming LinuxWorld Boston Expo (Apr. 4-6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the Green Line to Boylston T stop or the Orange or Red line to Downtown Crossing T stop. The Nature Conservancy is located behind Macy's at the corner of Chauncey. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540091000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1139533686000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone March Meetup</name><id>4851300</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1143158400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/4851300/</event_url></item>
