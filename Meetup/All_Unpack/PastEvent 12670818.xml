I cannot promise Heather Graham so me doing a good impression of RollerGirl will have to do.  If that image frightens you, bring blindfolds, smiles, friends, and a good sense of humor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll rock out another fun blend of short form games and wackiness!  No experience required!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$3 suggested donation for room rental and to keep up this wonderful website!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is a reminder we will be in the 1st room on the left upon entering the Democracy Center.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this a special note for all of you who haven't made it out yet to an incubator, there's no time like the present and there's no time like the this Thursday at 7:30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to meeting many more of you soon!  And for all you regular goofballs, remember improv is an addiction that should be satisfied as often as possible but especially on Thursdays at 7:30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions or concerns? Shoot me an email!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Jedrusiak....yea that's right i just put my full last name on this piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267317729000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266833677000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Improv Powers: The Spy Who Dinged Me....</name><id>12670818</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267144200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/12670818/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
