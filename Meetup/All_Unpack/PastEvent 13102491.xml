We'll be doing some climbing this coming Monday night at MetroRock in Everett and we hope you'll join us.  Mondays are women's climbing night, so ladies you get 50% off the Basic Safety class or a reduced day pass (this doesn't mean it's only open to women!  Men, we want you there too, you just don't get the discount).  Make sure you call and reserve a spot in the class in advance 617–387–ROCK (7625).  If you've never been check out www.metrorock.com for more info.  RSVP yes if you'll be there, and I'll tell you how to meet up with us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lookin' forward to hangin'!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krissie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Krissie</member_name><member_id>6035276</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271286425000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Guests</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club</urlname><id>1342211</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Brettl-Hupfers Ski &amp; Sports Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270565968000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday night rock climbing at MetroRock!</name><id>13102491</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271113200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brettl-Hupfers-Ski-Sports-Club/events/13102491/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/6/global_14187494.jpeg</photo_url></item>
