&lt;p&gt;Are you a blogger, content creator, or do you have a passion you love to share? Membership sites are an emerging trend in monetizing blogs. There are Millions of blogs online and the unfortunate fact is that 86% of sites will never make more than $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meetup will discuss how you can use a membership site to sell access to premium content, build a legitimate business, and maximize all traffic to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop giving your traffic away to google adsense or other ad networks for pennies per click. Start converting traffic to your own premium membership site for $10, $40, or $100 or more a month.&lt;/p&gt;
