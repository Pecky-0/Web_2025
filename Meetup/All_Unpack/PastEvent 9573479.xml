I am back from the Palm Springs International Film Festival and will be setting up many movie dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( Sweden , 2008) Directed by Tom as Alfredson. Screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist, based on his novel. Cast: Kare Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar, Henrik Dahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing quite like an ethereal Swedish vampire movie - with its title taken from a Morrissey song - to help you make it through the doldrums of winter. It begins with the pain of a 12-year-old boy named Oskar (Kare Hedebrandt), who is the favorite whipping boy of a particularly nasty bully. Enter the pale and empathetic Eli, (Lina Leandersson) who knows (as one of the undead) more than most about living as an outcast. Morbid, darkly humorous (don√≠t miss the overly-curious poodle), mysterious and occasionally quite bloody, Let the Right One In stands out in a year when all things vampire are hot. &amp;quot;as delicate, haunting and poetic a film as you're ever bound to see... a chilling fairy tale.&amp;quot; - director Guillermo Del Toro (Cronos, Hellboy, Pan's Labryinth) 114 min. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/lettherightonein/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.apple.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bill</member_name><member_id>4262367</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233967971000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232582675000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let the Right One In</name><id>9573479</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233189000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/9573479/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/8/global_5698696.jpeg</photo_url></item>
