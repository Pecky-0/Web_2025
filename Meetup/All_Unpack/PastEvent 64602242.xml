&lt;p&gt;Her Radiance Dareen Travaskyr has led the Temple of Lathanderâ€™s Light for many years, making it a source of good and civilization in the otherwise wild Daggerdale. When the priestess received a vision urging her to create a powerful icon against an impending darkness, she employed a group of adventurers to complete her divinely inspired tasks. But evil has spies everywhere. Now, the party of heroes might be the only thing standing between forces bent on a grisly fate for the temple's inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun Never Rises is a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons adventure for four to six players. This adventure uses pregenerated 1st-level characters whose backgrounds link directly to its story. This short adventure is designed to introduce players to the threat presented in the Web of the Spider Queen D&amp;amp;D Encounters season, which is slated to begin on May 30, 2012.
