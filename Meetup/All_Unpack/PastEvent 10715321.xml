Club Passim is a wonderful venue that I have been to many times.  Come at 6 pm and we can chat about songwriting, the show starts at 7 pm.  The food is also excellent, as Veggie Planet is attached to the club.  I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be sitting in the back of the room on the side with the windows.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247182093000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Musicians &amp; Songwriters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild</urlname><id>1420875</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The NEW England Singer Songwriter Musician Guild</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245763996000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Club Passim Open Mic</name><id>10715321</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247004000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NEW-England-Singer-Songwriter-Musician-Guild/events/10715321/</event_url></item>
