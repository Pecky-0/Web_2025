However, because this is a private home, our &amp;quot;vouchsafe&amp;quot; policy is in effect for first time guests.  That simply means a kindred member needs to meet you somewhere public for a brief, friendly chat over a cup of coffee.  Just a good vibes check... no big thing.  :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Actual address, directions, phone #s to be shared</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Hicks</member_name><member_id>3427608</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266352967000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Followers of Asatru</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>asatru-242</urlname><id>369297</id><group_lat>41.8600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut &amp; Western Mass Asatru Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239714879000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Disablot </name><id>10181951</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240682400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/asatru-242/events/10181951/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/b/d/global_5331005.jpeg</photo_url></item>
