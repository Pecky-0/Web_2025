&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the show "Ghost Hunters" The Atlantic Paranormal Society is the most famous investigative team in the world. The TAPS Home Team carries on the work that Jason Hawes and grant Wilson started before there was "Ghost Hunters." The Home Team conducts untelevised investigations "at home" in the New England region. Members of the TAPS Home Team recently appeared on the Ghost Hunters Halloween Live Show and are now here in Portsmouth, NH to teach you what they do, how they do it and what they encounter in the field. Real evidence will be played and equipment will be available to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
