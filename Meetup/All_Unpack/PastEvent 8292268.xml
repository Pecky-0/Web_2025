Its very nice, meandering along woods and streams. We can meet at the Blackstone River Visitor Center on RT 295 in RI. From Boston, take 95S into RI, then 295-S ( at exit 4 I think). Go to exit 9 and turn around to be headed back N-the Center is on 295 N bound side. There is a Duncan Donuts, restrooms, and plenty of parking, and the trailhead access is behind the building.
