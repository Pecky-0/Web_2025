The foliage should be close to it's peak and trails at Walden Pond and Lincoln woods are great for running. (They are mostly smooth without many rocks or roots to trip on.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll find a 5 mile loop which includes a run around Walden and some trails in the surrounding woods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since its Halloween, I was thinking it would be fun to wear masks/costumes during the run. If you are up for this bring something along.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people are interested we could also have a late breakfast at the Main Street Market in Concord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in front of the gift shop at 9:30am</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>4878639</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289591785000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287973625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Halloween Trail Run (Walden Pond &amp; Lincoln Woods)</name><id>15216815</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288531800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/15216815/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/d/global_15812509.jpeg</photo_url></item>
