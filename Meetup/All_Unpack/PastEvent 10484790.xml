Friday night I want to see Night at the Museum and Wolverine. I'm told they will probably have Star Trek and Up together along with Terminator and something else. The official times won't come out till Tuesday so I'll post a note here. Its $9 per person, but you do get both movies. I was told to get there about 7:45/8 pm. The first movie doesn't start until 9 pm though. (Late night!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do realize this is mainstream movies, but I figured the drive in might be the unusual aspect that this group maybe interested in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the website if interested in more details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mansfielddrivein.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mansfieldd...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>nissan rouge with kayaking racks on roof and dog paw bumper sticker on back</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243814021000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Indie Film Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indiefilm-235</urlname><id>1188113</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Beyond the Multiplex: Hartford's Indie and Foreign Film fans</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243214641000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Drive In Double Feature</name><id>10484790</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243640700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indiefilm-235/events/10484790/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/e/global_8785662.jpeg</photo_url></item>
