It is supposed to be one of the best.  We will be site seeing around Rockport before the trip, and possibly after.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yankee Fleet's knowledgeable naturalists narrate the tour with nuggets of whale wisdom, and on-board whale  researchers are available to answer one-on-one questions. While eyes are sure to be filled with majestic sightings of mammalian sea beasts (if you don't see one, your next trip is free), the body's fellow senses won't be forgotten. Passengers may have the opportunity to listen to whale sounds, touch whale  artifacts, help capture plankton, analyze water visibility, and measure how far away whales are by counting the seconds between their lightning flashes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*PLEASE BE SURE TO GET YOUR TICKET ONLINE AND RESERVE THE 2:30 TIME*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whale Watching Rates &amp;amp; Reservations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult Ticket  $45&lt;br /&gt;Senior (60+)  $38&lt;br /&gt;AAA - Adult  $41&lt;br /&gt;AARP - Adult  $41&lt;br /&gt;Students, Military  $41&lt;br /&gt;Child Ticket (ages 4-16)  $29&lt;br /&gt;Children 3 and under  FREE&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the corner of Broadway and Main in Rockport or ticket booth in Gloucester</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Indy</member_name><member_id>3662208</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lelia</member_name><member_id>4161738</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281273830000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>InquisitiveMinds</urlname><id>1441172</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Inquisitive Minds</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280268653000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rockport and Cape Ann Whale Watch</name><id>14233420</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281189600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/InquisitiveMinds/events/14233420/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/f/global_16982687.jpeg</photo_url></item>
