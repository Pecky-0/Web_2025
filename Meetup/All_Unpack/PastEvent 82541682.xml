&lt;p&gt;Daniel Schmidt: LMT,Reiki II, Polarity Therapist, RPT03, Born and raised within a family of talented healers, a natural inspiration of love, faithfulness in the divine, and the realities of living within bliss has encouraged me to exercise my intuitive talents to there fullest potential. It is from these early childhood beliefs of unity through love that I have grown onto this path of spirituality, health, and total wellness. Combining a free spirited intuitive practice with the profound tools of Polarity therapy, Massage, and RYSE, it has become my life's work in making true healing possible to everyone who seeks it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join me for a two hour meditation to engage the energy of our inner core and balance our most effective aspects for embracing the graceful artist within and the Preparation for seasonal change. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;In celebration of this transformational experience&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;we will conclude or meditation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;with a special Sound healing from the 7.1 sacred sound healers, to unify and complete the energy of the evening with community, creativity, and love. combined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;With Neptune and Venus in our alignments,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;this months yoga nidra meditation will be one of powerful enlightenment, the transformation of redundant belief systems, and the awareness toward collective consciousness.  September 25th is: "The Day of the Symbiotic Satirist."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enhancements will include :Determination, goal orientation, and the easy part of "hard work."
