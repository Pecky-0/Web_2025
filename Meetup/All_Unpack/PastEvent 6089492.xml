Folks are still welcome to stop by and hang out in Windsor for a relaxing afternoon (starting a little later than originally planned).  I'll still be glad to fire up the grill regardless of the weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do let me know if you plan to attend, so I can e-mail directions.  Also so I have a sense of how many to expect and how much food is needed.  I've got some random beers, mead, etc... but if you want anything special to drink, BYOB please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best!&lt;br /&gt;Mike Hicks&lt;br /&gt;Hartford Asatru Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Hicks</member_name><member_id>3427608</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185905025000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Followers of Asatru</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>asatru-242</urlname><id>369297</id><group_lat>41.8600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Connecticut &amp; Western Mass Asatru Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185632821000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Poolmoot!
