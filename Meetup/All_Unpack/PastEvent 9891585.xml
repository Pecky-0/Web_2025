In this presentation, Zak will make the case that promoting the evolution of individuals and cultures entails promoting the evolution of education itself.  As such, large scale cultural transformation requires refashioning our most basic educational technologies in light of what we know about human development.  This talk will include an integrally informed meta-theoretical map for thinking about these issues, with special attention to the art and science behind developmental assessment.  Moreover, this evening will also set the stage for a look at research and reform efforts currently under Zak's direction at Harvard University and the Developmental Testing Service he works with.  This presentation will offer a variety of perspectives and insights on issues at the core of the Integral Worldview. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zak is currently a student of philosophy and cognitive development pursing a doctorate at Harvard.  He is also the Senior Analyst for the Developmental Testing Service (&lt;a href="http://www.devtestservice.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.devtestser...&lt;/a&gt;) where has worked for years employing cognitive developmental models and metrics in a variety of real world contexts.  He recently published a paper that was posted on Ken Wilber's blog on &amp;quot;Myth Busting &amp;amp; Metric Making: Refashioning the Discourse about Development in the Integral Community&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/477)" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.kenwilber....&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a real opportunity to engage in an up and coming integral thought leader, and to bring your own insights to this subject area.  It is sure to be a compelling and engaging discussion.  We hope to see everyone there as we continue to build our integral community in the greater Boston area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Love,&lt;br /&gt;Ted &amp;amp; Nicole&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ted</member_name><member_id>1467536</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole Trudel Churchill</member_name><member_id>3348175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242343628000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236298322000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Developmental Assessment and the Evolution of Education</name><id>9891585</id><headcount>23</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238714100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/9891585/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/f/global_7098607.jpeg</photo_url></item>
