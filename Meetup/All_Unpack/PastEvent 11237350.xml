We're playing on Boston Common on Tuesday. Head on down to Boston and you will see that the softball field flood lights will be on. If there isn't a softball game, then we will play some day-time ultimate at night. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember the rule on Boston Common - &lt;b&gt;no cleats&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new and are not sure how to get to the field, check out the details on &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/pages/Boston_Common/"&gt;Boston Common&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, then contact either of the organizers listed for this game day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the game plan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;8:30 - Toss the disc around, meet folks, be merry &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;8:45 - Overview of the rules, safety, etc - then divide into teams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;9:00- Play!!!!!! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;10:30 - Conclude the meetup with snacks and socializing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what we humbly ask of you (works great as a checklist): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arrive on time to be guaranteed a spot in a game (RSVP is optional - but helpful for others who want to know if people they played with in a previous game are going to be there &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring WATER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a regular, please consider bringing a buck for the Frisbee Fund&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, we will supply the frisbees, cones, lanyards, first aid supplies (hopefully will never be used) and our pretty smiles. As we periodically mention, all these supplies are paid out-of-pocket by your loving Frisbee organizers and everyone has been so generous with their donations to-date. Thank you and let's keep the dream alive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours 'til the cat meows, &lt;br /&gt;Oliver and Robert&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the big softball field flood lights...they will be on!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert</member_name><member_id>4002514</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Oliver K</member_name><member_id>6144635</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252114513000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251642480000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tuesday Night-time Ultimate @ Boston Common</name><id>11237350</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251851400000</time><rsvp_limit>45</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/11237350/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/e/global_8208430.jpeg</photo_url></item>
