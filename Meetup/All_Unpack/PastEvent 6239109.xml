Rock it!&amp;quot; - are having a concert that starts at 5:30 p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find out more information including ticket prices, directions, etc. at: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.northhaven-fair.com/" target="_blank"&gt;North Haven Fair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if members would like to meet before/after the event for some coffee, please let me know.
