Its going to be a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm creating a meetup to make it easier for you guys to see who else is interested in playing. Hopefully, this will make it a lot easier to form a team or teams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in playing just post YES and someone will get in touch with you about the league. If you want to be the captain of a team, just post that in with the comments when you reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some guys don't have cars, but don't worry b/c we can pair you up with a team that could help you get to the games. Also, I believe you can access the field via bus. Check &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hopstop.co...&lt;/a&gt; and as the destination use &amp;quot;watertown st. and aldrich rd.&amp;quot; for Borough/City use &amp;quot;Watertown, MA&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The league starts July 19th, and registration has already begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check &lt;a href="http://baffl.blogspot.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://baffl.blogspot...&lt;/a&gt; for more info about the league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please don't hesitate to email me any question you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Frank&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>5001087</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215788823000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Flag Football Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>flagfootball-49</urlname><id>621930</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Co-Ed Flag Football</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213490145000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MEN'S FLAG FOOTBALL LEAGUE INTEREST???</name><id>8144558</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215615600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/flagfootball-49/events/8144558/</event_url></item>
