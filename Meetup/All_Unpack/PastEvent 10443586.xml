Bring the games you love!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting late afternoon so we can have plenty of time for the longer games.  If you can't come until later, that's fine, just mention it in your rsvp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll order some pizzas, but please bring snacks and drinks as gaming can be very exhausting =).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Malden and there is lots of street parking and I'm about a 15min walk from the Malden stop on the Orange Line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday, I will email all the &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; RSVPs my address.  Sorry if this is inconvenient for anyone, but I don't want my address posted for everyone to see.  Thanks and hope you can make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a RSVP cap, so there will be no maybes allowed, as we need a more accurate head count&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243466054000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242706091000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night at Jenny's</name><id>10443586</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243108800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/10443586/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/3/global_1509331.jpeg</photo_url></item>
