It is a little quieter and by switching the night of the week perhaps some new members will be able to come and join us. Skelligs seems to be a perfect place for a casual meetup place although it can get a little loud at times.  The November meetup was very relaxed and friendly, and we had several new members.  The food and drinks are affordable and there's plenty of room for us.  We had such a nice time and everyone went home with a full belly and new friends. Eventually I'd like to alternate monthly Tues and Thurs (to accommodate those with custody days) but for now it will remain Thursday nights.  Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198281696000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195174882000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston/Burbs Divorce December Meetup</name><id>6749779</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198108800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6749779/</event_url></item>
