We may know who has won that election come Thursday, but we have no idea how our election process will pan out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will play some familiar games and learn some new ones. And we are cooking up an interesting format to honor our democratic process. So Get out the Improv! Keep your eyes on the Improv! Ask not what your Improv can do for you, but ask what you can do your Improv! Give me Improv or give me death!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No prior experience is necessary. Come on out and play some short form games, meet new friends and have some laughs. If you have any questions, email me and I'll get back to you asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mere $3 donation helps to cover cost of the rental space and website expenses.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Walk in and we are in the big room to the right.
