We want everyone who cannot come on the SECOND SUNDAY of each month to have an opportunity to attend a meetup on the FOURTH SATURDAY of each month, and anyone who came on the second Sunday is of course also welcome to attend on the fourth Saturday - you can never have too much fun as far as our puggies are concerned.  Until further notice, the Saturday meetups will be held in King Clovis's backyard in Brockton. The yard isn't as big as Buford's and my kiddie pool is just an old black rubber horse tub, but there's plenty of shade and water, and enough room to run around in. Your organizer is short on lawn chairs, so unless you intend to sit on the grass, please remember to bring your own lawn chair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do have a fenced yard large enough to accommodate anywhere from 30 to 60 Puggies and a few assorted other small breeds, please let your organizer know. We would like to give everyone a chance to host who would like to host, and we'd certainly like to give Shar a break every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please be sure to let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET READY FOR HALLOWEEN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to be back in Carver the second Sunday in October for Halloween, and we're going to have a costume contest with PRIZES, ribbons for the proud owners and toys for the dogs! Best costume and runners up 2-4. plus prizes for best puppy costume, best home made costume, most creative costume. This year, we're going to have CONTESTS, more prizes and toys! - pug races by sex, and by age, best trick, cutest pug, best tail wagger, oldest pug, youngest pug, and my all time favorite - FATTEST pug. No fair stuffing your pug for this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need people to bring Halloween snacks to this one, and if you bring homebaked snacks for the pugs, make sure they are soft snacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the early morning drizzle and the overcast, damp weather, the Pugs would just NOT stay home!  At least two dozen people and their Pugs showed up in your organizer's backyard to run and romp through the wet grass.  Everyone had a great time - although there were a few Puggies who didn't enjoy getting quite so wet - and we even had a little brindle puppy in attendance, running the bigger dogs off their feet and stamping his little feet like a dog four times his size.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, we had quite a few new folks at the meetup, and we certainly hope they had a good time! We are always thrilled to welcome new members.  Be sure to let us know if it's your first time attending, and we will be happy to introduce you to the rest of the gang. All family members are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the folks who brought the goodies for the meetup. Even though our monthly host provides the soft drinks and the paperware, we depend on our members to bring the snacks for all the pugaholics attending. They haven't failed us yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be soft drinks and something to snack on for the people attending! If you bring treats for the Pugs, please ONLY hand out treats around the central table where everyone can keep an eye on the dogs, DON'T FEED CLOVIS, and PLEASE BE SURE that nothing gets dropped - your organizer has a Pug (yes, that would be Clovis...) who has brain damage which makes it very difficult for him to swallow. I don't want Clovis to choke to death on a stolen treat, and I'm sure no one else does either.. Thank you for your consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $72.00 twice a year in January and July for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups and the South of Boston Small Breed Dogs Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have. If you would like to help defray the costs, please make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Cletus's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224442314000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221425477000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug September SATURDAY SECOND Pug Meetup!</name><id>8756799</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222538400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/8756799/</event_url></item>
