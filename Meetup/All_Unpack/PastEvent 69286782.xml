&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night (6pm-10pm) tabletop 4e D&amp;amp;D game. We're in need of 2-3 people to fill out our group. We've lost two members already, due to moving away and life circumstances. We're losing another to moving away within two weeks. It leaves us VERY thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're a tactical heavy game, and use miniatures, projectors, etc. In the process of building a table with IR light pens and a projector on the underside shining up to the center. Host has two cats. You need to be able to provide your own transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the group: 5 current people (soon to be 4) Mid to late thirties (35-40), all members have plenty of experience with different systems. We tend to play 4e almost exclusively (much to my chagrin!), as two members feel very strongly about the rule set. We're pretty raucous, use foul language, sometimes have a six pack while gaming, and tend to be pretty no-holds-barred in the humor department - we definitely are not "P.C.".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current game is Eberron based, with a Shadowrun flavor, and elements of Lovecraftian weirdness flavored all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roleplaying: 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action: 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story: 7-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If interested, contact me!&lt;/p&gt;
