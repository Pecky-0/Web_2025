Scott Fitzgerald about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards: a man, like any of us, who is unable to stop time. We follow his story, set in New Orleans from the end of World War I in 1918, into the 21st century, following his journey that is as unusual as any man’s life can be. The film tells a grand tale of a not-so-ordinary man and the people and places he discovers along the way, the loves he finds, the joys of life and the sadness of death, and what lasts beyond time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The film, ambitious if flawed, also is lyrical and melancholy as it tells the story of a man aging backward.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;USA Today&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Claudia Puig&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This odd, epic tale of a man who ages backwards is presented in an impeccable classical manner, every detail tended to with fastidious devotion.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Variety&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Todd McCarthy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P.
