I've never seen it on the big screen, have you?  Let's call it our group's Summer Blockbuster - so what if it was made over 70 years ago, they don't make 'em like they use to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is the 1938 classic starring Errol Flynn as our hero in green tights and  Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian. Directed by Michael Curtiz who would make Casablanca a few years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the story, King Richard the Lionhearted has gone on a crusade and has been captured, leaving his sneaky brother Prince John (Claude Rains) and the crooked Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) to reign over his land. A real pair of tyrants, they robs, tortures and kill peasants for greed and power. Fortunately, from the woods of Sherwood rise a brave, reckless man, Sir Robin of Locksley ( Flynn), who gave up his property and title to help his fellow Saxons, stealing from the rich to give to the poor. With his band of merry men, he'll keep on keeping on until England is safe again and Richard is back on his throne. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uplifting score, the glorious Technicolor cinematography, the heroics of Errol Flynn... It all gels to perfection and makes the viewer regress to childhood. It makes you grab a stick or anything and pretend to be in a swordfight, then put your fists on your hips and laugh heartily. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and for tradition's sake , here is a link to Roger Ebert's review: &lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030817/REVIEWS08/308170301/1023" target="_blank"&gt;http://rogerebert.sun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there- after the film we'll stroll through the Cambridge Forest for a well-deserved feast at a local restaurant,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Probably won't have a feather in my cap,  at film's end I'll hoist a meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215472009000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214259368000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Adventures of Robin Hood</name><id>8199949</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215298800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8199949/</event_url></item>
