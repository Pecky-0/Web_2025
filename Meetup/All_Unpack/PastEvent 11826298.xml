So let's meet just inside the theater doors at 6:00 and I'll buy tickets from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're going to be late, need directions or have to change your RSVP after 4:30 p.m. on Monday, give me a call!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on Monday for A Christmas Carol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;508/308-4897&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Carrey was born for certain roles. This is, I believe, one of them. He not only does the voice of Scrooge, but also the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Not to mention the &amp;quot;supporting cast&amp;quot; of Gary Oldman, Bob Hoskins, Colin Firth, Robin Wright Penn and Cary Elwes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1810049009/info" target="_blank"&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/a&gt; isn't a new story to most of us, but every time it's redone, the directors seem to bring a completely new aspect to the telling of the story. This time, Robert Zemeckis (Polar Express, Back to the Future) brings CGI to the tale. And lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE Christmas story for 2009. Come watch it with us (shortly before Thanksgiving!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ebenezer Scrooge begins the Christmas holiday with his usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk and his cheery nephew. But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come take him on an eye-opening journey revealing truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of ill will before it's too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE USUAL STUFF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet inside the theater doors and then I can buy us all discounted tickets ($8.00 each for FMM members and their guests). I also have $3 vouchers each for small sodas and small popcorns (can be used towards a larger size). Exact change makes me like you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, guests are welcome, just be sure to include them in the RSVP so that I know who/how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP as up-to-date as possible. And please call me if you're going to be late or need to change your RSVP after I close RSVPs on the site (2 hours before we meet). My cell is: 508/308-4897. I'm also good for directions if you get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, we'll head to Fridays (I'll bring the coupons!) to chat about the movie (and just chat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll update this meetup with a specific time a few days before, so &lt;b&gt;keep an eye on your email!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you for Disney's A Christmas Carol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;508/308-4897&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259194328000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257711920000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Disney's A Christmas Carol</name><id>11826298</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259020800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/11826298/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
