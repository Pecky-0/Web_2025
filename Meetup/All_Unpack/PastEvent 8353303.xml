<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We're really starting to develop a very nice group of people for these tennis events and there's always room for more so all newcomers are encouraged to come play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday is the day again this weekend.  Since my preference on the day and place of Meetup Tennis is well documented, I'll let everyone know that there's more tennis scheduled on Sunday.  Eric, who many of you know from the SingleEvent, will be at Conard at 9:00 on Sunday morning. Eric's self-professed claim to fame is his pink balls so he'll be easily identified.  As long as you're getting out to play, pick the day (or both days) this weekend that best suits your schedule.  Obviously, I hope to see as many of you as possible on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to be there but something may come up so keep an eye on the RSVPs.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me at 860-559-7983 with any questions or comments.
