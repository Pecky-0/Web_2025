We had to push the date back a few weeks due to the school schedule, and we're trying a Thursday instead of a Friday because it's difficult for him to get student assistents on a Friday. Hope that's not a problem, but if it is, please RSVP 'No' and say so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll note again that if you are not comfortable being filmed, you do not have to be. Please come and sit off-camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group will meet at Hildreth Media Center at Southern Maine Community College. The Media Center is building 11 on the campus map at the hyperlink below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voluntary donations will be accepted to cover costs. Note that since a collection was not taken at the November meeting, I will ask people to please be slightly more generous this time ($4) to cover two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.smccme.edu/campusmap/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smccme.edu/campusmap/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.smccme.edu...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540015000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Advocates for Oil Awareness</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-169</urlname><id>113465</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1134176507000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness January Meetup</name><id>4813372</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1138320000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-169/events/4813372/</event_url></item>
