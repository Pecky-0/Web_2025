Your non-dream group friends are invited too! We will play dream games, sing dream songs, dance to dream music, and play with oracle cards. Feel free to bring your favorite dream songs, musical instruments, dream games, and/or oracle cards to show off and play with. The theme of the party is dreams, so bring anything which reminds you of dreams and dreaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also Deerheart's birthday party and a masquerade costume party. Presents, cards, costumes, and masks are all optional. You are invited (but not required) to wear a mask or to dress as a character from a dream or a character from Shakespeare's play, A Midsummer Night's Dream. Some costumes and masks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of his birthday, Deerheart, Visionary Dream Guide, will be offering free mini-dream-sessions, so please bring a dream if you want it interpreted. Deerheart usually charges for dream consultations, so this is a special treat! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a vegetarian potluck buffet, so bring some vegetarian food to share. Please don't wear fragrances or bring alcoholic beverages or other intoxicants, as this is a chem-free and smoke-free household. This is an indoor party with air conditioning, so even if it's a hot day, we will be comfy-cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 6 PM - 12 Midnight. This is a party, so you can drop in whenever you feel like it. If you wish to attend you must RSVP to be sent the address of the party. Sorry, I can't put the address on the net.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deerheart</member_name><member_id>7399016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280450838000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Dreamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonDreamers</urlname><id>1339734</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Dreamers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278869300000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Midsummer Night's Dream Party</name><id>14068195</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280008800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonDreamers/events/14068195/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/b/global_16339147.jpeg</photo_url></item>
