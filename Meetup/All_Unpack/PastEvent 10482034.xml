Join players of all levels as we get together for some rallies and Tennis Games.  The game plan is to warm-up with some rallies and then break out into some games or singles, doubles and round robin play!  We are here to have fun, get to know each other and play Tennis!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first in our 3rd Saturday morning of the month tennis series and we hope you will join us and mark your calendars through October as well.  Players of all levels are welcome as long as you know the rules of the game and are able to rally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School offers plenty of opportunity to play tennis on its 6 tennis courts and two practice backboards.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd Saturday of the Month Tennis&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, June 20th @ 10am&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School&lt;br /&gt;128 Town Street&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Meeting Place: At the Tennis Courts between the practice boards and door to the courts on the side of fields (not the street/parking side).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Alternate Meeting Place: Look for us on one of the courts.
