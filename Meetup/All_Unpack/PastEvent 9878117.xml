As we pass by the Spring equinox, we easily welcome the change that will come with warmer weather, longer days of sunlight, and the return of colorful flora. It's easy to accept the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; changes, but the hard and difficult ones are often met with resistance. And as expressed in the quote above, resistance to change can result in denial, stress, frustration, yearning, and ultimately suffering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this weekly meetup, we'll discuss resistance and how it can keep us from being with, and accepting, our current situation. We may offer a short guided meditation, some readings, and always good discussion and time for silent meditation as well. Please join our mindful community and help create an experience of peace, presence, and mindfulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm regards.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting people at the door until 6pm</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239050907000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236170888000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Meetup: Resistance</name><id>9878117</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238450400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9878117/</event_url></item>
