NOTE CHANGE OF DATE DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at the north end of the parking lot of 45 Lyme Rd office bldg behind Coop Market on Rt 10 in Hanover and leave from there @ 5:30pm in a  carpool/caravan to north end of the Dartmouth Skiway parking lot in Lyme. We'll depart on foot from the  Skiway parking lot to the trailhead  (corner of Dorchester Rd. &amp;amp; Grafton Pond Rd; approx .2 mi from Skiway lot) to begin our hike @6:00pm. Let us know if you plan to meet us at the trailhead rather than in Hanover so we won't look for you in Hanover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Please note that parking at the Dorchester Rd. intersection across from the trailhead is no longer permitted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a good shot at being down before sunset, but a headlamp is always a good idea on an evening excursion into the woods. My dog will be along, other friendly dogs are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food/drink in Hanover afterwards pending interest of the group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345245714000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344277647000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Holt's Ledge AT, Lyme NH</name><id>76583212</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345152600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/76583212/</event_url></item>
