I will give you more details on his bio, and what he will be sharing with us in another week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I can assure you that Joe is experienced, creative, and a good communicator.  He will give us all the inside scoop on what is going on in the world of financing real estate when you don't want to, or the deal does not make sense to, go the private money route. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set the day aside- June 2,  7-9PM.  And see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be there at 6:30 to meet and greet with any early comers!</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212621082000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Lending has tightened- maybe overtightened.
