After about one mile, turn left onto Monsen Road. Continue on Monsen Road until you see the refuge entrance on your left. Drive slowly and look for a small sign, the entrance is between 2 homes and can easily be mistaken for a driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a ride? Please ask for one in your rsvp, saying what area you are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This original 250-acre area that belonged to Samuel Hoar is still known as the ?Great Meadows,? and is open to visitors. Several trails are available for wildlife observation, including the Dike Trail, a 2.7-mile loop around one of the marsh pools. Trailside interpretive signs and an observation tower provide visitors with additional views and information about the refuge, its management, and its wildlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch afterwards at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen's Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17 Main St&lt;br /&gt;Concord, MA 01742&lt;br /&gt;(978) 369-9885 (call ahead and ask for Sue o Nancy)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208183804000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206397657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Meadows walk </name><id>7594708</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208010600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/7594708/</event_url></item>
