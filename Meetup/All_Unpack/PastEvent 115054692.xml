&lt;p&gt;Themes: The One Fund and Cinco De Mayo!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come join the Wedelns on a pub crawl through Southie to benefit the victims of the recent Boston Marathon bombings. The Wedelns are an outdoor sporting group and we want to support the victims of the recent tragedy. Let’s get together, Be Boston Strong and support the victims while getting some sorely needed social time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been to our past pub crawls, you know it’s a ton of fun. Don’t be shy, if you’ve never attended any of our events, this is a great opportunity to not only support the victims but also meet some great, down to earth, friendly people and find out more about what we awesome Wedelns are all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate in the crawl we ask that you donate $5-$10 as you arrive. All proceeds will go to The One Fund, Inc. In return, you will obtain a quality Be Strong Boston bracelet to wear for the crawl and in the future (1/2 blue with "Boston Strong"; 1/2 yellow with a heart).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The One Fund Boston, Inc., created by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Boston Mayor Tom Menino, serves to help the people most affected by the tragic events that occurred in Boston on April 15, 2013. For more information: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;onefund&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;boston.org/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
