They serve Italian, Steak, Chicken, and Fish. At 120 NM, it's a bit further than most of our destinations but the scenery is beautiful. And what could be better than a nice relaxing scenic flight on a Saturday? It's just across the Hudson River, just north of Stewart International. Meet at the terminal at FIT at 11:15 AM for an 11:30 departure. Please post PIC and/or PAX and head count.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1342442263000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340816632000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fly to Kobelt Airport (N45) for Lunch.</name><id>70983752</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342279800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/70983752/</event_url></item>
