Main St. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cafe Noir is a French inspired restaurant with a distinctively cozy and comfortable European feel. The bar is large, and the creative drinks and food are tasty. Its hard to believe we haven't been back in almost over a year! So, whether you've been there before or if you'd like to give it a try, let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a bright green coat!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
