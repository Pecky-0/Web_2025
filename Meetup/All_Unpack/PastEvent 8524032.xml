Learners of all levels, and native speakers welcome! &lt;br /&gt;This is an opportunity to meet with other learners and practice whatever you'd like to work on. Bring any books or homework you would like to review, and ask a native speaker to help you with pronounciation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often David Liang will help us practice learning some new vocabulary using a song.  Mandarin speakers can also benefit  by learning the English and helping the Non-native speakers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We often go to eat afterwards, If interested bring $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reece and Adele&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- &lt;br /&gt;------------ &lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: (a member says that Mapquest directions are confusing) &lt;br /&gt;BCNC is at 38 Ash St., off of Oak St. between Washington St. and Harrison Ave. &lt;br /&gt;Oak St. is between Kneeland St. and Marginal Way (alongside the Turnpike)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest T stop is Orange Line New England Medical Center. &lt;br /&gt;Walk toward the South End (away from Chinatown) on Washington St and take the first left onto Oak St. The entrance to the building is in Ash St., the first small street on the left.
