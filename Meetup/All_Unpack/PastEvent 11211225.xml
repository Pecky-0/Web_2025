<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I know there is already a meet up for Sunday morning but Sunday is good for me and there is a waiting list for the Swift River Meetup. Hopefully some of those on the wait list will join us on the Quaboag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the boat launch at the intersection of RT 9 and RT 67. When you turn off of RT 9 on to 67 there is a break in the guard rail before the bridge. There may be no sign. There is a good size parking lot. The launch area is in the back corner near the river. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  plan on paddling up towards White's Landing then back to the launch at RT 67.  I am guessing it will take 1 1/2 to 2 hours to get to Whites Landing. If any one wants a shorter paddle they can go one way. If you plan on going one way please arrive by 8:15 to unload and get your car to the other ramp. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any one has time and wants to go longer we can paddle the other direction for a ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paddle in the rain but will cancel if there are thunderstorms predicted for the morning.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan L</member_name><member_id>7773139</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251810974000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251334744000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quaboag River W.
