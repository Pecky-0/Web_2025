A facilitator provides insights on drawing technique and the artist-model relationship as it informs the creation of artwork. Limited drawing materials are provided to encourage spontaneous participation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If drawing is not for you, a group will also be viewing the Avedon Fashion 1940-200 Photo exhibit.&lt;br /&gt;Richard Avedon was one of the greatest image-makers of the twentieth century. He revolutionized fashion photography with his imaginative, spirited portrayals of the &amp;quot;good life” showing beautiful women wearing extraordinary clothes in irresistible settings, as well as memorable portrayals that are both elegant and reserved. The upbeat spirit and innovative design of his compositions caught the eye of editors and art directors at Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue—the primary magazines for which he worked—while his vision of the modern American woman, one of wit, individuality, and fast-lane glamour, captivated the public. His enormous success defined the role of the high-profile fashion photographer that we know today, and many of his images have become icons of photographic history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We'll all meetup afterwards for coffee and dessert. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wed. nights is &amp;quot;pay what you can&amp;quot;.  $5 is suggested. &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/visual-art-appreciators-boston/about/"&gt;About this Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mfa.org"&gt;Museum of FIne Arts, Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me in the Visitor Center.
