&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurants and events in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Harry's Bar &amp;amp; Burger - on North Main Street (where Chinese Laundry "used to be" for those that remember!) ;-)&amp;nbsp; Look for the life-size cow out front!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry's Bar &amp;amp; Burger is the latest restaurant edition to North Main Street's Restaurant Row and is situated between XO Cafe and Mills Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you Providence Burger Connaisseuers - Harry's is the latest burger joint created by the owners of Luxe and Rick's Roadhouse - so if you want to make a comparison - this should be on your list. Harry's offers burgers, but they also specialize in dogs, so no matter your craving they have something to suit. Also, there is a fine selection of craft beers and other concoctions to tantalize your taste buds, so it really has something for everyone, no matter your culinary preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will have the whole second floor just for us,&lt;/strong&gt; so what are you waiting for; let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Meetup. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
