Please let me know if anyone has any questions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vishal &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello everyone, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How exciting does it sound to ride a horse and enjoy a great scenic afternoon?  Whether you are a beginner or a pro on horses, there are plently of courses you can choose from to accomodate to your adventure.  So bring those cowboy hats and boots and lets ride on the galloping horses.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is good size Ranch in Acton, MA called Bobby's Ranch.  They have good beginner lessons and some scenic courses on their farm.  I am still working to get a good deal for us, but it depends on number of people in our group.  So if you can please register ahead of time so we work accordingly.  I will send more details on the costs in next couple of days, but approximately it will be around $50 per person.  We can work on car pooling options for anyone who needs it.  Maybe we can do a meetup before hand to discuss details :).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you guys there.  Feel free to email me with any questions: vishal.shah196@gmail.com.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Gallops, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vishal&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Vishal</member_name><member_id>10102488</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253548969000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251687861000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Horseback Riding</name><id>11243359</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252861200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/11243359/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
