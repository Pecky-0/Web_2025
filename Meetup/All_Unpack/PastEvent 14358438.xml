From their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD&lt;br /&gt;(1962) Director: Robert Mulligan. Screenplay: Horton Foote, based on the novel by Harper Lee. Cast: Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, James Anderson, Robert Duvall, Estelle Evans, Collin Wilcox. (129 min.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the publication of Harper Lee’s well-loved novel by coming to Cinestudio to experience the original 1962 film on the big screen! Horton Foote won an Academy Award for his adaptation of Lee’s semi-autobiographical novel about a young girl named Scout growing up in segregated Alabama of the 1930s. It is when her father, attorney Atticus Finch, takes the case of a young black man falsely charged with raping a white woman, that Scout learns about integrity. A tender and courageous masterpiece with a demand – that everyone is treated equally under the law – that still challenges today. &amp;quot;I put everything I had into it – all my feelings and everything I’d learned in 46 years of living, about fathers and children. And my feelings about racial justice and inequality and opportunity&amp;quot;. – Gregory Peck, winner, Academy Award for Best Actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts at 7:30pm and you may want to be there in plenty of time, the only showings are over Labour Day weekend and this one.  I've cross-posting to the Indie &amp;amp; Foreign Movie Meetup because they often go to Cinestudio, and this is the type of film they often see.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283957556000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281296853000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"To Kill a Mockingbird" @ Cinestudio</name><id>14358438</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283901300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/14358438/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/d/global_17036573.jpeg</photo_url></item>
