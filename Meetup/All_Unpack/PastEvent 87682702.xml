This climb will end around 4 PM, or earlier if we are fast at hiking.  Afterwards, we can head out for a well-earned Odells brew.  Although it is easy, this is a popular climb.  Therefore, we will need to be on our guard.  In addition, Odell's is avalanche prone. If conditions in the gully are poor, or weather forecast is bad, we'll try another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;We will need one lead climber per second climber (or two seconds).  The leader must be capable of WI2, preferably with experience with climbing Odell's Gully.  Leaders will need to know how to belay off the anchor with Reverso in order to belay two second climbers simultaneously in a staggered manner.  Seconds will need to have experience in top rope climbing at a minimum. Also, this climb will involve 8 miles of hiking.  You will need recent hiking experience as well.  I will be a leader for this climb.  Whether you are leader or second, please answer the questions I ask in the RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;All will need their own mountaineering boots, crampons, harness, locking biner+belay device, helmet, balaclava, two or more pairs of gloves (they get wet), water proof (eg, Gore-Tex) tops and bottoms, warm fleece layers, and thermal wicking layer.  In addition, each must have their own ice tools (axes).  But, because this is an alpine climb, try to keep light.  Leaders will need rope, quickdraws or similar, webbing, ice screws, and several locking biners for anchors.  We'll have to coordinate to make sure we bring the right gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;Let's meet up at 7 AM at the AMC Store in Pinkham Notch.  Be ready to go, so come earlier to get your boots on and packs set.&lt;/p&gt;
