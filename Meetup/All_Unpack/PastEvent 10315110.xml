Let's have a meet 'n greet, talk about why we joined, share as much or as little as you feel comfortable about yourself, enjoy some snacks and have some fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting on the grass to the right of the basketball courts.  There might be volleyball nets set up so we would be to the right of those too.  There is parking right there along the street next to our picnic.  Google Maps has it listed as 102 Charles River Road.  Charles River Road is between Watertown Square and the Target in Watertown, behind Panera.  There is only one basketball court, across from Irving St. so it should be easy to find us.  Very few people go there so we can talk openly and should have the area to ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its on odd time but I thought most people could make it since its on a Sunday at a time when people are winding down, before dinner.  Since its after lunch and before dinner I thought people could bring finger food type of snacks to make it simple.  Panera is just down the street if people need the restroom.  Bring a sheet or something to sit on, maybe a game or activity that we can pick from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're here to support each other, let's meet and have some fun too.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet on the grass to the right of the basketball courts, near Irving St.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242767997000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People on a healing journey</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma</urlname><id>1373363</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Freedom from Fear/ Anxiety /Emotional Trauma Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241216945000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Our first, new picnic meetup is soon!</name><id>10315110</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242590400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma/events/10315110/</event_url></item>
