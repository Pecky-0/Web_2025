T times are 4:10 and 4:20pm.  They had no 4:00 pm.  The pro shop thinks we'll probably get in all 18 but said it would be tight.  If this changes anyone's RSVP please let me know.  They do require a credit card to hold the reservation so any cancelations have to be made early Friday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From their Web Site:  Granite Links Golf Club at Quarry Hills, was voted “Top Ten Best New Upscale Golf Course in the US” and &amp;quot;Four Star Best Place to Play&amp;quot; and, alongside other such national notables as Pebble Beach, TPC Sawgrass, Bethpage and Kiawah Island, Granite Links was named to the 2009 / 2010 selection of the &amp;quot;100 Greatest Public Golf Courses in America!&amp;quot; by Golf Digest.&lt;a href="http://www.granitelinksgolfclub.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be around the pro shop just before 4pm, at the range prior to that.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cindy</member_name><member_id>5281885</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1287855014000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>golf-260</urlname><id>1127024</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2200012207</group_lon><name>The Boston and Beyond Golf Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248108250000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Granite Links</name><id>10916019</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248552000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/golf-260/events/10916019/</event_url></item>
