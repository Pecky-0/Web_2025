<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>In this event, you will have the opportunity to see an uplifting movie on how Cuba was able to survive its own Peak Oil crisis in the early 1990's, when the Soviet Union collapsed, and the country lost 3/4ths of its oil imports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is inspiring to see that communities in action can mitigate impacts due to a lack of oil and energy.  People who have seen this movie invariably respond positively to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open at Zero Station at 6:30PM. Movie is at 7PM.  Come early and bring a dish to share, and talk!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting people as they come in.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alastair</member_name><member_id>4963124</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225323650000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>TT'rs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>TI-Portland</urlname><id>1233823</id><group_lat>43.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2900009155</group_lon><name>Tohidu Transition - Portland Maine</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222760635000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Power of Community</name><id>8862890</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223593200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/TI-Portland/events/8862890/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/a/global_4989194.jpeg</photo_url></item>
