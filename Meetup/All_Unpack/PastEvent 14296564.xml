I merely want to hike in the company of other strong hikers for safety and fun, while getting some great exercise and enjoying the views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup can be flexible as I am certainly open to trail variations including a carspot and adding mileage, so don't be shy if you have suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is a weather contingent hike.  If there is a threat of rain I will postpone this hike for dry weather.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281364256000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280787312000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Adams loop from Appalachia: via Airline and King Ravine</name><id>14296564</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281186000000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14296564/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/7/global_16916503.jpeg</photo_url></item>
