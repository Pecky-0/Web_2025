<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a QK outdoor doubles event on grass. It is a friendship tournament event meetup consisting of doubles matches played in a King-Queen format, meaning that you will be playing with and against different people during pool play. Assuming an equal gender signup, matches will be reverse coed. Top players after pool play will compete in a playoff format. Cost: $0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a friendship tournament format, meaning call your own faults, as there are no referees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers for these events will be Matt BenDaniel and Brian Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be using the ruleset listed in the first post on the following: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/messages/boards/thread/8548572?thread=8548572" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/messages/boards/thread/8548572?thread=8548572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event will start at 10:30 AM and will likely last at least until mid afternoon (~3:30 PM). If you would like to play in this event you must commit to staying at least through the end of pool play. Remember to bring snacks/food and water/beverages, as this event will involve a significant amount of volleyball play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is intended for players with experience playing reverse coed doubles format. To sign up for this event, send an email to Brian using the following link on meetup: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=4774008&amp;amp;subject=5/18" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=4774008&amp;amp;subject=5/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the email, provide the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Name &lt;br /&gt;

 * Gender &lt;br /&gt;

 * Unless we already know you well, please include a detailed description of your reverse coed doubles experience. It is *your* responsibility to truthfully convince us you have the skillz. If you're a beginner to doubles, you should check out other tournaments which offer B/BB level. &lt;br /&gt;

 * Confirm that you have read the ruleset at the link above and that you agree to play by those rules. &lt;br /&gt;

 * Confirm that you can commit to play from 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM. &lt;br /&gt;

 * Signup partner name (if you have a signup partner)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preferably, each player in a signup pair should send an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this event we will aim to have player numbers in a multiple of four so that there are no sitouts for players. Preference is given to AA/A players who sign up in male/female pairs. Single signups will initially be placed into the event to as needed to achieve gender balance, although if there is a lack of signups near to the event date we will allow gender imbalance in the roster. Note that sending an email does not guarantee a spot to play; spots are only guaranteed if you are added to the event page.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt BenDaniel</member_name><member_id>1878223</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1368933741000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1368273773000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Advanced Outdoor (Grass) QK RevCoed Doubles Volleyball</name><id>118869532</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1368887400000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/118869532/</event_url></item>
