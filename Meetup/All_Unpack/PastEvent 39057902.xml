&lt;p&gt;Book review:&amp;nbsp; "A poignant, bitingly funny Indian satire and love story set in a scientific institute and in Mumbai&amp;rsquo;s humid tenements. Ayyan Mani will not be constrained by Indian traditions. Despite working at the Institute of Theory and Research in Mumbai as the lowly personal assistant to a brilliant but insufferable astronomer, he dreams of more for himself and his family. Ever wily and ambitious, Ayyan weaves two plots: the first to cheer up his weary, soap-opera-addicted wife by creating outrageous fictions around their ten-year-old son; the other to sabotage the married director by using his boss&amp;rsquo;s seeming romance with the institute&amp;rsquo;s first female&amp;mdash;and very attractive&amp;mdash;researcher. Meanwhile, as the institute&amp;rsquo;s Brahmins wage a vicious war over theories about alien life, Ayyan sees his deceptions intertwining and setting in motion a series of extraordinary events he cannot stop. Unfailingly funny and irreverent, Serious Men is at once a hilarious portrayal of runaway egos and ambitions and a moving portrait of love and its strange workings. One of 2010&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;First Novels to Savor.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Sunday Telegraph"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorothy's note:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Totally implausible story line, but I very much appreciated the vivid portrayal of life in the chawl.&amp;nbsp; "Their home was exactly fifteen feet long and ten feet wide... "&lt;/p&gt;
