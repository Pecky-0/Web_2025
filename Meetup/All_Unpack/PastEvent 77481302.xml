&lt;p&gt;It's time, with a month before the 11th anniversary of 911, to start hitting the lies with truth.  Come to Milly's Tavern Tuesday to brainstorm, discuss, mingle, and re-energize the Manchester chapter of Merrimack Valley for 911 Truth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to have 9/11 Truth video nights in Manchester, but haven't for a while. The time is right to re-start those. It's been almost 11 years since the 9/11 disaster and successive U.S. governments have started wars, taken away our civil liberties and based broad policies on the "official story" of 9/11, which we now know cannot be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrimack Valley 9/11 Truth has taken the lead in the area in providing educational material to people on "what really happened" on 9/11. We'll start monthly video screenings again in Manchester soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meeting will be to re-organize and plan our next public event. Come on out and join us - we know you've got a lot of good ideas to share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarians also meet here every Tuesday at 5:30 pm for the "Milly's Mingle."  Though not all Libertarians are skeptical of the official story, there are many who are and understand the importance and impact of the lie and that exposing that lie is of the utmost importance.  Hope to see you there!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go up the stairs next to the bar and we'll be at a table near the pool tables.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344989223000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344821077000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Merrimack Valley 9/11 Truth rebirth</name><id>77481302</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344981600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/77481302/</event_url></item>
