<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will gather signatures from Boston residents in support of the civil liberties resolution, at Faneuil Hall, 5-6:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amnesty International and the Ford Hall Forum are jointly sponsoring a teach-in about torture.  This is part of a series of local teach-ins (including one in Cambridge the day before).  At the Boston event, they're holding a protest vigil before the teach-in begins, and this is a good opportunity to find Boston residents who support constitutional freedoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location is right outside of Faneuil Hall, at Quincy Market.  (can't add outdoor venues with no phone number on meetup.com...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find the rally, and look for Aslam and Michael, who will be there at 5pm with clipboards, petitions, and handouts.  If you have a clipboard of your own, bring it.  If not, you can help by standing near someone collecting signatures and distributing handouts, or by going around the rally and directing people to the signature gatherers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/events/northeastern/denouncetorture.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/events/northeastern/denouncetorture.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amnestyusa...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cos</member_name><member_id>237353</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273539726000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>civil liberties supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>aclu-34</urlname><id>2348</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>Boston Civil Liberties Task Force</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1114658257000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gather signatures at Amnesty/Ford Hall Forum event</name><id>4664491</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1115154000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aclu-34/events/4664491/</event_url></item>
