You will be present with each chakra with deep attentiveness and purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of meditation provides the female soul with the time and space needed to create a new relationship with her inner self, eventually achieving improved emotional and physical health, and a state of general “well-being” by learning to invoke the&lt;br /&gt; “Love Response” as a method of self healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The “Love Response , coined by Dr. Eva Selhub, provides all of the tools you need to transform anger into compassion, release your fears, overcome guilt and shame, embrace self acceptance,  connect through empathy, and ultimately strengthen your natural ability to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Should you choose to participate, you are making a commitment to yourself and to each member of the class. The group will journey together as a community of support and personal resource. For this reason, attendance will be a very important&lt;br /&gt; component to its success.&lt;br /&gt; (If there are dates that you cannot attend, we can discuss&lt;br /&gt; the possibility  of makeup sessions.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of this six week session is $75.00. All materials will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;Because of these difficult economic times, special consideration can be given for financial hardship. Please speak with us if this is necessary for you to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Class will be held each Monday beginning April 20th through June 1st&lt;br /&gt;(excluding Memorial Day, May 25th)&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting, some classes may be held outdoors.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Name:                                    Address:&lt;br /&gt;Tel. #                                      Email&lt;br /&gt;Cash______ Check_______&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>7932349</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sally Fiore</member_name><member_id>8203589</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241912903000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239379744000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Group Process in Heart, Mind, Body &amp; Soul Care.....Continuing Meditation</name><id>10158994</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240268400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/10158994/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/f/c/global_7505116.jpeg</photo_url></item>
