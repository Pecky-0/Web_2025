Are you feeling the stress of trying to find a new job? Then join Barb Tremlett as she shares with you how to keep your stress down and your self-confidence up in your search for new work. We will explore how our self-confidence, self-esteem and self-love correlate with how we look to potential employers and learn how to showcase your strengths through positive energy and positive attitudes. Good things come when we are feeling positive about ourselves and our situations and we tend to get stuck when we are feeling negative. Un-stick yourself and learn to bring abundance of all forms into your life with a few simple tricks and a view from a different angle. This class is FREE of charge so join us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Barb Tremlett</member_name><member_id>8282665</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1358901784000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Enlightened Abundant Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LawofAttractionandAbundance</urlname><id>1244444</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5</group_lon><name>Abundance, Empowerment and the Law of Attraction</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1354988002000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE ~ Keeping Up Morale &amp; Confidence While Unemployed</name><id>94589532</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>3600000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1358897400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LawofAttractionandAbundance/events/94589532/</event_url></item>
