<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Dark Knight opens on July 18. Friday evening works for some of us, so we'll schedule a late-evening show then. The movie starts at 9:50 PM. Let's try to meet around 9:30. Everyone buys their own tickets. Since this is a big summer blockbuster on opening night, you might want to get your tickets in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at Westboro this time, instead of Blackstone 14 or Showcase in Worcester. That's the Regal Cinema (formerly Hoyt's) behind Uno's at the intersection of 135 and Route 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Special thanks to Ken, for looking up the showtime and the length of the film (it's 2 1/2 hours long). Thanks Ken. ***&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have glasses, a goatee, and a Superman cap.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223157604000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215273534000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Dark Knight at 9:30 in Westboro</name><id>8281014</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216431000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/8281014/</event_url></item>
