This pizza place offers vegan pizza which several members have said is very good.  Also, some members have said this pizza place has started to offer faux chicken but, we will need to confirm if it is still offered since it is not listed on their menu.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The web site:&lt;a href="http://" target="_blank"&gt;http://...&lt;/a&gt; www.pearlstpizza.com   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearl Street Pizza does not offer alcoholic beverages, but there are several bars and pubs nearby for members who would like to go for a few drinks after the Vegan Pizza Meetup.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the New Hampshire Animal Rights League (NHARL) is tentatively planning an anti-fur demo at the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua prior to the Vegan Pizza Meetup but, plans have not been finalized.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope this year, 2011 will better for all animals by having more people becoming vegan or vegetarian.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Wishes for all in 2011, &lt;br /&gt;Steve&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve</member_name><member_id>7631884</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365646527000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>conscientious diners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-204</urlname><id>160942</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Vegan/Animal Rights Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293838413000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January 15, Saturday,  Vegan Pizza Meetup in Nashua</name><id>15871907</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295118000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-204/events/15871907/</event_url></item>
