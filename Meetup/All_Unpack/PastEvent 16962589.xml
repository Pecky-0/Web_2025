&lt;p&gt;Join us if you are ready to go BEYOND ALLIES and build a CROSS-ISSUE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; $2-$10 collected at the door. &lt;em&gt;Newcomers always welcomed!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;($10 includes raffle ticket for a $20 Trader Joe's gift card)&lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THIS IS NOT A MEETING - IT'S A FUN NETWORKING SOCIAL!&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;No Program. No Speaker. Just Us. For Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As always we'll help you meet people - so no worries if you're new to SoJust&lt;/strong&gt;, plus we'll have "I'M LOOKING FOR" and "ASK ME ABOUT" tags, a CATALYST CORNER staffed by our amazing STARZ (regular attendees), our wildly popular JOBS BOARD and ACTION STATIONS to make it even more likely you'll find the right connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WANT TO CROSS-PROMOTE YOUR EVENTS AND CAMPAIGNS?&lt;/strong&gt; Looking for like-minded progressives to hang out with in Boston? Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions? Join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU.&lt;/strong&gt; Members are all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. Some just moved to Boston and others were born here. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #FF0000"&gt;HEY ORGANIZERS!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If you're involved with a group or project and want to spread the word bring flyers for the free lit table. ACTION STATIONS - if you have an action that can be done in 2 minutes (sign a petition) or within 2 weeks of the event (attend rally, stuff mass mailing) bring it so SoJusters can get connected to you and your work. This is not a typical tabling event, there'll be lots of opportunity to schmooze and network! Email robbie@sojust.org for more information about the Action Stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The venue is open to anyone over 18 (must be 21+ to enter after 7PM) and is partially physically accessible - elevator is at the back of the venue and bathrooms are big enough for manual, but not motor-powered, wheelchairs. Lir is across from the Hynes Convention Center. Parking near Lir is really hard - you could get lucky or you could drive around for 30 or more minutes. There are parking garages by Back Bay station. Best bet is to take the T to Back Bay or Hynes Convention Center (which is the closest T stop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOCIALIZING FOR JUSTICE - &lt;a href="http://www.sojust.org/" target="_blank"&gt;www.sojust.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SoJust is all about building a cross-issue progressive community, network and movement in Boston. We're doing it by putting the SOCIAL back in SOCIAL JUSTICE. We focus on creating welcoming spaces that foster relationship-building across issue silos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SoJust isn't a non-profit 501(c)(3).&lt;/strong&gt; We're a grassroots volunteer-run member-supported cross-issue  progressive community that's been growing steadily since August 2006. We  have over 1700 members, we've hosted 90+ events and we manage an online  hub of progressive events and resources at www.sojust.org.  If you've benefited from this cross-issue progressive network please  contribute the suggested annual membership fee of $25. You may do this &lt;a href="http://www.sojust.org/dues/" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or at any of our events. Thank you for helping us continue to provide a space for like-minded progressives of all stripes.&lt;/p&gt;
