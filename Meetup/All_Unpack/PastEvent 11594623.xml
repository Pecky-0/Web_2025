The mediums we use to share our craft are antique Tibetan singing bowls and planetary gongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a 20-minute explanation on vibration, intention and positive thinking. Then we give an easy lesson on ringing the Tibetan bowls, after which each participant sits in a zero gravity chair with a pair of Mindfolds, (a special blindfold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gong at the feet is tuned to the frequency of the Earth, which restores balance and has a grounding effect. While the gong at the head, is tuned to the frequency of the Sun. This is a mystical sound we like to call the “Sound of Creation”. Other planetary gongs as well as Antique singing bowls and tingshas are used during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, October 18 &lt;br /&gt;5:30-7:30pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workshop Fee is $50 (please pre-register)&lt;br /&gt;Contact 860.693.YOGA (9642) or info@yogacentercollinsville.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yoga Center of Collinsville&lt;br /&gt;10 Front Street&lt;br /&gt;Collinsville, CT 06019&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>christine</member_name><member_id>6235505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256497869000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>energy healing members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>holistic-energy-healing</urlname><id>449005</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>Energy Healing &amp; Holistic Health</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255181547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>An Evening of Vibrational Self-Healing</name><id>11594623</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255901400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/holistic-energy-healing/events/11594623/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/0/global_11137216.jpeg</photo_url></item>
