Based on the change of meetup location, I also updated meetup time.  Please read this carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cross posted hiking event from my meetup group, Hiking/Snowshoeing Vermont Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's hike together to the highest mountain in Vermont!  Each year, about 40,000 people visit this mountain.  You'll be one of them after this hiking event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I generally use Butler Lodge Trail from Underhill, West side of the mountain, I'd like to take a different route and explore the mountain from the east side.  This makes it easier for us to park our cars at the trailhead as well as the final destination with the shortest amount of driving time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Hiking Plan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;7:20AM   &lt;/span&gt; Spot cars at Shaw's super market parking lot on Rt 100. Leave here no later than 7:30AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;8:00AM &lt;/span&gt;  We all drive to &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;South&lt;/span&gt; the LT Trailhead on Rt 108. Leave some cars here.   Drive other cars to the trailhead on Nebraska Valley Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;8:25AM   &lt;/span&gt; Arrive at the Lake Mansfield Trout Club Parking Lot at the end of Nebraska Valley Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;8:40AM   &lt;/span&gt; Start Hiking from Lake Mansfield Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;                After reaching Taylor Lodge, we take Long Trail to North.  &lt;br /&gt;We hike through LT and get to Forehead, The Nose, then, eventually we reach to the highest peak in Vermont, The Chin (4393 ft).  We hike out to Long Trail parking lot on Rt 108.  We'll pick up cars at the trailhead on Nebraska Valley Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Hiking Level:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Moderate to Difficult.  Total mileage is approximately 10.4 miles, but most of the mileage are ridgeline. &lt;br /&gt;We'll hike slow to moderate pace. (1-1.5 mph), it will take at least, 7+ hours.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Suggested Meetup Location:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shaw's ( Super market ) on Rt 100&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;at 7:20AM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Address: 820 Waterbury Stowe Rd, Waterbury, VT  &lt;br /&gt;Please refer &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/462914/Shaws_Waterbury_VT_MeetupLoc.jpg"&gt;this JPG link &lt;/a&gt;to see the exact location at the Shaw's parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the attached &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=820+WATERBURY-STOWE+RD&amp;amp;city=WATERBURY&amp;amp;state=VT&amp;amp;zipcode=05676&amp;amp;country=US"&gt;MapQuest map link&lt;/a&gt;.
