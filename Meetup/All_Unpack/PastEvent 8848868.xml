His financial engineering is deep and he enjoys trading currencies. It is his currency trading that is the subject of this talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topics Mamoud will cover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overview of currency trading marketplace&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul type="1" class="fakeOL"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spot market&lt;li&gt;Currency futures&lt;li&gt;Currency options&lt;li&gt;Currency forwards&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currency trading concepts, factors and formulas&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mamoud Sadre developed a patent pending methodology for construction of semi-structured products for risk management in manufacturing. He founded FTS Electronic Marketplace. His most recent product is an application that uses a currency index as a factor in an asset pricing model. He has a blog at &lt;a href="http://newageeconomics.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NewAgeEconomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market Talk led by Eric from Vermont&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric will give the market perspective this month. Since early September he has repeatedly, and precisely, expressed the prediction that we would have an Elliot Wave 4 - a screeching down market. He expressed it at the talk by Basil in the beginning of September, then again at the September Wednesday meeting and then again at the October 2 Levels meeting. At the Levels meeting he was adamant that looking at bases for longs was a waste of time and that the bases showing up now were primarily in the short ETFs and double short ETFs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future we will have more variety in our market talks, each month hearing from a variety of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This premeeting will cover a recent Tom O'Brien volume analysis where Tom predicted recent price action. We will compare it to other recent Tom O'Brien predictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets starting at 5:30 PM.
