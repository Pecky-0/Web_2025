The project was funded by a grant from the Worcester Cultural Commission and we've asked Scott and Donna to talk about all aspects of this project, from the grant process to working with the artists to the issues associated with creating a book. This should be a very informational evening. Many of us have already seen and enjoyed Scott's and Donna's work as photographers and, we hope, They'll be showing  some images from the book to go along with the lecture.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the folks with the Camera</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233257207000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229911727000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"20 Artists Book Project" Lecture at the 7 Hills Camera Club</name><id>9373956</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232582400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/9373956/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/4/5/global_6713189.jpeg</photo_url></item>
