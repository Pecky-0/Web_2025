About $31/person (includes tax/tip) for food and $20-$25/person for the wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since the meeting is a Tuesday night, we can use the Dining Room which is larger than the bar area. So currently there's a higher attendee limit of about 30. Please RSVP if you'll be attending and are bringing a guest.  Preference will be given to current active members first, if the limit is approached. A Maybe RSVP will be allowed, but of course must be changed to Yes or No, as we approach March 16th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please answer the two dinner polling questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Wine-HudsonMA/polls/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email me with any questions/concerns.&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mike Blake</member_name><member_id>748860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269392925000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Wine-HudsonMA</urlname><id>662173</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5599975586</group_lon><name>The AWS Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267569365000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AWS March Meeting at Chloe's Restaurant</name><id>12761632</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268780400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wine-HudsonMA/events/12761632/</event_url></item>
