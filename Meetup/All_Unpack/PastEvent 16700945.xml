Various spiritual traditions speak of the importance of quietude and the stillness of mind and spirit in order for transformative and essential spiritual growth to occur. How, then, does one come to this place of spiritual silence and stillness when our minds are filled with chaos and chatter? In this seminar you will learn the origin of the chaos and chatter and how to connect with the source of true silence within and all around you. Don't miss this opportunity to know for yourself the peace that lies dormant inside of you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;$25 - Bring a friend for free &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2 Additional Seminar will be offered that same week end: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Holy Communion &lt;br /&gt;- Experiencing the Presence of God &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For more details about these seminar, please check the calendar&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299202802000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1298645550000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Inner Silence with Father Peter</name><id>16700945</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299198600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/16700945/</event_url></item>
