<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Please read the full description from top to bottom, before you RSVP Yes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tenatively planning a hike on Tuesday to a difficult winter 4000 footer. The standard route is long, involves many potentially difficult water crossing, and isolated. The route I am planning will be on trails some of the way but will involve two bushwhacks that cut out some mileage, elevation gain, and water crossings. These bushwhacks are a common winter route and are reportedly being broken out over the previous weekend by two other groups. However wind may erase their tracks and some snow may fall on Monday. Nonetheless it seems a good time to get out here before Wednesday snow make it more difficult again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested sign up to the waiting list and I will approve you if you pass the prescreening. The description is intentionally vague, but if you can't figure it out, then perhaps this isn't the hike for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike may be cancelled due to weather or condition reports. This hike often takes many attempts so bagging the peak is not guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With bushwhacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt;: 11-12 miles &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation gain&lt;/b&gt;: ~3400 ft  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without bushwhacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distance&lt;/b&gt;: 14.5 miles &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevation gain&lt;/b&gt;: 3921 ft  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please keep your rsvp's up to date.
