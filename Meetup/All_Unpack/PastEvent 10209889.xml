<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We will continue with Schopenhauer's  &amp;quot;The World as Will and Representation&amp;quot; (Volume 1). Volume 1 is comprised of 4 books and an Appendix of Criticism of Kantian Philosophy. Our current plan is to cover these in the next 5 meetings, one book at a time  (and the appendix at the end). So  Book 1 of  Volume 1 is the text for the next meeting. See you soon. We will have 3 weeks until the next meeting, we can spend some time to read secondary materials too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One edition of the work is:&lt;br /&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Representation (In two volumes) Volume 1&lt;br /&gt;Dover Publications&lt;br /&gt;Translated by E.F.J. Payne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not plan to read Volume 2 this time around, it is a collection of notes/essays related to Volume 1. This work is also mentioned sometimes as The World as Will and Idea, at least the abridged version is called that, it is published by Everyman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!! DIFFERENT LOCATION !!!&lt;br /&gt;I set this next meeting to Shabu.Ya, as always, if you do not find us there by 7:15pm then we are next door in the Bombay club.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the philosophy group from the staff.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242948874000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240015589000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Representation</name><id>10209889</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241737200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/10209889/</event_url></item>
