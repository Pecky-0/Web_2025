I love chai tea so I am all for it!  They are a New Orleans based company which was forced to evacuate after Hurricane Katrina.  They are now rebuilding in Hartford as a wholesale and internet based company.  Their website is &lt;a href="http://www.indonique.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.indoniue.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George has offered to set up a fun tea tasting at Sweet Harmony in Middletown.  He will talk with us about tea history, origins, culture, etc.  I've checked out some reviews and they are all favorable for Sweet Harmony.  They have full meals, pastries, and desserts.  So let's sit and enjoy some deliciously prepared morsels, dessert and tea!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197309614000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195568803000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Try Some Chai!!!</name><id>6775998</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196532000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/6775998/</event_url></item>
