<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This month we'll be talking about haunted restaurants and bars, and whether or not we should start floating the monthly meeting around from site to site again.  On the upside, it's often pretty eas to get an investigation when you go there and hold a meeting in one.  On the downside, there's no regulaity, and it's hard to remember to keep the Meeting updated!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got an opinion?  Preference?  Be at Unos!  Wednesday night, 6:30 pm, on the bar side.  Ask for "the ghost hunting folk" at the entrance and they'll point us right out to you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monthly dinner meetings are primarily non-mandatory networking events. Although we talk business updates for half an hour and occasionally play evidence clips, these events are for discussion, event/investigation planning, asking questions, telling your own stories, etc. They're so we can all have a little unpressured time as a group. Because our regular place has closed down we are going back to our roots and will be choosing a different reportedly haunted location to meet at each month. Keep your eye on the meetup post for details. We look forward to you joining us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie Roy</member_name><member_id>4599203</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355971478000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1355861309000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>kgjdnyqqbjc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355959800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/95810552/</event_url></item>
