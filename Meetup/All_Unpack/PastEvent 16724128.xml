It is the way we can all thrive in the "new normal" because we have chosen to educate ourselves on RE Investing or really our financial education. We probably all share a common goal of being extraordinarily successful professionals. But we can&amp;rsquo;t do it alone.  Your single most important success factor, second only to taking action, is having a Power Team that extends your reach, broadens your skills, and attracts new opportunities to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am asking for suggestions, participation and involvement to get our respective years off to a great start.  I saw this email come across this morning and chose to act on it! And now I feel empowered to get us together and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I welcome your comments and suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
