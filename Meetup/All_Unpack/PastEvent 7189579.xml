I'd like to get us back on track to the last Thursday of the month. This meeting is going to take place at the Park Hill Gallery (where we had our Holiday Party.) Scott thought it might be fun to bring in some flashes with our cameras and do a little lighting chat on how to be creative with this style of shooting. He is interested in sharing ideas about flashes and lighting whole rooms beautifully with them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic ideas behind this meeting can be seen at a web site called Strobist: The free, off-camera flash lighting blog is all things flash photography. Learn how to use your digital camera and small flashes like a pro. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not that interested in this subject- that's ok to, we always have a side group to chat about whatever we want too! It's all about you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing everyone again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna and Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Scott and I are always to try to greet everyone who comes to the meetups.
