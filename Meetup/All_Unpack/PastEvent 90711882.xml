This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: The Apartment - in the Jewelry District (oh sorry, its called the &lt;em&gt;Knowledge&lt;/em&gt; District now), near Olga's Cup &amp;amp; Saucer and across the street from Rick's Roadhouse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might have been there already on various outingsÂ and we had a great time when we went sixteen months ago! Wow, it's been a long time! The band that played was unexpectedly good too, and now they have a podcast which includes music and comedy that begins at 8, so we'll check that out too! The Apartment has a great name, it's cute, comfortable and the beer selection is pretty good as well, so what's not to like! If you've been and you loved it, you know all you need is a reason to go again, and if you haven't, let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing the black hat or scarf in my picture, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
