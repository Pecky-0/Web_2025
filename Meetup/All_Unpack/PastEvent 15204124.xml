Indoor adult lap swimming.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reviewing the comments listed in the original idea and with my own personal schedule, Thursday night is the winner at 7pm!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connell Memorial Swimming Pool (Mass Dept of Conservation and Recreation- DCR, formerly MDC)   &lt;br /&gt;220 Broad Street   &lt;br /&gt;Weymouth, MA  02188   &lt;br /&gt;781 335 2090   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is FREE at all DCR managed pools.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, November 4th   &lt;br /&gt;7pm.  Pool is open until 9pm (I will not be swimming for 2 hours, but feel free to stay if you can!)   &lt;br /&gt;We can meet in the pool area.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a venue I have tried before therefore I am not aware of the locker room conditions.  Per comments listed in the idea section, they do have showers but no outlets (for hair dryers).  I am not aware of the locker situation.  Feel free to post additional information if you have it to help.  THANKS!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pool schedule (per DCR website):   &lt;br /&gt;Open from October 9th through the end of May.    &lt;br /&gt;Hours:    &lt;br /&gt;Monday â€“ Thursday   &lt;br /&gt;7am to 3pm  Open Swim   &lt;br /&gt;6pm to 9pm   Adult Swim   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday    &lt;br /&gt;7am to 3pm Open Swim              &lt;br /&gt;6pm to 9pm Family Swim   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday and Sunday   &lt;br /&gt;10am to 5pm Open Swim&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the pool area.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Julie</member_name><member_id>4336960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289719769000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fitness Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ssfmgfitness</urlname><id>280193</id><group_lat>42.1699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9499969482</group_lon><name>The South Shore Fitness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287853623000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adult Lap Swim</name><id>15204124</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288911600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ssfmgfitness/events/15204124/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/4/global_17172772.jpeg</photo_url></item>
