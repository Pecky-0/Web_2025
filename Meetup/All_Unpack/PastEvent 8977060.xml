<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>First meetup at my place. Bring whatever project you're currently working on or would like to start.  I have some basic craft materials (and I have a sewing machine), but you should bring anything you might need. I will provide some snacks, but feel free to bring snacks and drinks to share, or a couple of bucks if you want to chip in to get a pizza. No smoking inside please.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227571938000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Crafters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondiycrafts</urlname><id>1301641</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Jewelry Design and DIY Crafts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224206476000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday Night Craft-o-rama</name><id>8977060</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226190600000</time><rsvp_limit>27</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondiycrafts/events/8977060/</event_url></item>
