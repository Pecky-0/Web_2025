OOPS!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/shock.gif' border='0' alt='shock' /&gt;  But, since I have already arranged the day, I am just going to change the location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the members of my Dining Out group said some Bickfords Locations offer a Brunch buffet and that it is pretty good.  So, I figured, let's give it a try!  Brunch is $11.95 for all you can eat and a bottomless cup of coffee? Talk about a good deal, right?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event fills up, please RSVP &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; with a comment requesting to be wait listed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has not attended previous events, please plan on bringing a dollar to help me defray the cost of posting on meetup. For everyone who has attended, I only ask that you contribute every other event. This would be such a big help to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you there! Yay brunch!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the one with red hair in my piccy! ;-)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216141563000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><why>We're great people and love to meet other great people.</why><group><who>Friends who brunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RI-Brunch-Bunch</urlname><id>964634</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch !</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213017746000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rhode Island Brunch Bunch July Meetup- BICKFORDS BUFFET- changed venue</name><id>8107827</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215961200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RI-Brunch-Bunch/events/8107827/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/7/f/global_4147919.jpeg</photo_url></item>
