Walk 2.5 miles along the Charles River trail from Watertown center to Waltham, where we will eat at an authentic Mexican restaurant.  We will walk at a moderate pace, and leashed dogs are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet on the Mt Auburn St bridge at 10 am. I will be wearing a red jacket. There is a municipal parking lot nearby just off of Main and Church St. where you can park for up to 8 hours.  We will have 3 cars in Waltham to drive folks back to their cars in Watertown. There is also the option of taking bus # 70 directly back from Waltham to Watertown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to meeting you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1161628577000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160436874000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Charles River Walk</name><id>5186793</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1161439200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5186793/</event_url></item>
