So the movie starts at 4:15. Let's meet inside the theater doors BY 3:45. If you're going to be late, get lost, or have a last-minute RSVP, please call my cell. 508-308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and hope to see you on Saturday for Bedtime Stories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;After Doubt, I'm gonna need a fun adventure movie like &lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809973784/info" target="_blank"&gt;Bedtime Stories&lt;/a&gt;!  Let's hit this one on Saturday afternoon. I'll update the time a few days before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Hotel handyman Skeeter Bronson's life is changed forever when the bedtime stories he tells his niece and nephew start to mysteriously come true. He attempts to take advantage of the phenomenon, incorporating his own aspirations into one outlandish tale after another, but it's the kids' unexpected contributions that turn Skeeter's life upside down.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted tickets for FMM members and their guests is $8.50. (Just be sure to include guests in your RSVP.) Small popcorn and small soda vouchers are available for $3.00 each. Please be sure to include guests in your RSVP, so I know how many to expect. Exact change makes me like you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you at Bedtime Stories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233361947000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231033516000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bedtime Stories</name><id>9437234</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232830800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/9437234/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
