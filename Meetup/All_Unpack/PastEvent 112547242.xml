&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was such a success that I want to repeat this every other week! We've helped a lot of people on that day, and I know we can do it again. Nights are still cool and people do appreciate the apparels we gave them. Be it new underwear, socks, t-shirts, or something warmer, all was appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Nagina, we also had a number of lunches to share with anyone who was hungry. I will definitely bring some myself on the 13th, and I encourage anyone of you who would like to do the same to just do so. A sandwich, a fruit, a snack (chips, chocolate) and a beverage (juice box or other) made a lot of people happy on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to start taking orders... As we get to know them better, and identify 'the regulars', I'd like to ask them specifically what they need, and see what we can do about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one special order for next time, a fellow named 'George Washington' (he insisted to show me his ID) needs a pair of shoes (size 12) and a pair of black pants (40 waist, 32 long), if anyone can find this, that would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we will wait about 15 minutes at the city place and will depart at noon shortly. If we have already left when you get there, don't hesitate to call me (781-308-4595).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the atrium of the City Place Food Court</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>frederick</member_name><member_id>25269862</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1365892697000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Boston Volunteers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BigEnoughtoDeliver</urlname><id>1343564</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Volunteers.
