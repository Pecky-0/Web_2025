Complimentary food and drink will be available.  Let's meet at the Gazebo in the Town Park at 7:00 - very easy to see from the street, and is a quick walk to the gallery. When going down Main Street in Essex Village, the Town Park will be on your right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get lost or can't make it to the Gazebo by 6:30 pm - give me a call on my cell phone 860-759-3932 - and we can let you know where we are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190502754000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190057319000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art, Food &amp; Drink in Essex!</name><id>6376491</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190329200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/6376491/</event_url></item>
