Discover how these teachings can be applied to your daily life, relationships and work life. Our meetings are opened to all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week's topic of discussion - Beginning Anew. Start the New Year with a clean slate and hope. The Beginning Anew ceremony is a powerful and intensely moving experience. It allows the participants look deeply within, share their feelings about others or events, and to let go of the obstacles to peace and harmony. There will be 4 main phases: 1) mindful incense offering, 2) sharing regrets, 3) expressing hurt, 4) sharing a difficulty &amp;amp; asking for support. Sharing is purely voluntary but listening just is equally a powerful experience. After each phase, a short meditation and loving kindness  prayer will be given the participants. Presented by Senpai Sensei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See our CALENDAR @&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bffct.net" target="_blank"&gt;www.bffct.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;REMINDER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; -  Hosted by the Buddhist Faith Fellowship.
