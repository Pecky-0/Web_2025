I am working on our Next Community Games Day, and should have a date in the next week or so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also working on securing a monthly gaming area for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to invite the group to come join us for some outside Geocaching fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn what its all about and do some different types of caches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who dont know, Geocaching is treasure hunting with handheld GPS units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring small trade items ( inexpensive trinkets ) to trade into the caches if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions please e-mail me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is parking on site. Please dress for walking in the woods. We will be walking quite a bit so where comfortable walking shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if any gamers do attend I would like to meet after the event to see if we can work out some details for Gaming events.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Wayne</member_name><member_id>1411667</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238712633000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>sagesofrpg</urlname><id>747276</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth, NH / Seacoast Boardgames Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222911119000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Geocache: I know its not gaming but its fun!</name><id>8877585</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223218800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sagesofrpg/events/8877585/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/c/8/global_5717576.jpeg</photo_url></item>
