I hope you'll join me for the first of the series as the New Haven Symphony Orchestra performs a concert titled American Earth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a chair/blanket, bring some beer/wine, bring your ability to enjoy free music while sitting outdoors with friends.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be heading to the green around 5pm to stake out a place for my blanket and start enjoying my crackers with cheese and wine.  I can't say for sure where I'll be sitting yet, but if you can't find me give me a call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact:  Jeanie (203) 494-3518&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216073274000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215743913000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Symphony on the Green</name><id>8318740</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215900000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8318740/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/c/global_4743308.jpeg</photo_url></item>
