It is total acceptance, it is the part of us that sees with the knowing and love of God. This love was made to flow out from our heart to other people. What stops this flow? It is the pain and suffering of present and past wounds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this workshop you will see what it is you are afraid of and what you need to do about it to get the waters of Life and the Love of God flowing through you freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over 25 years, Father Peter Bowes has devoted his life in service to God as an ordained Priest and Master Teacher.
