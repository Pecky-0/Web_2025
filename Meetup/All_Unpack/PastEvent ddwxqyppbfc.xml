&lt;p&gt;We expressively welcome anybody who lived for a while in a German speaking country. See you on Wednesday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not forget to RSVP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaj&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your humble organizer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Jacob Wirth is a German Restaurant in the theater district of Boston, that serves German favorites such as Bratwurst and Sauerkraut or Wiener Schnitzel. They also have Paulaner Hefeweizen and other German beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S.: There is parking right next to the restaurant, which is $20 (the deposit is NOT REFUNDED ANY MORE). If you like a walk in the Park, you can take advantage of the night special at the Boston Common parking for $11 flat. And off course with $4+ gas prices, the T-Stop is Orange Line - Tufts Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm usually the guy in a red Meetup T-Shirt.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kaj Kandler</member_name><member_id>1142521</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321548414000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>I moved this one week earlier than usual, so it is not right before Thanksgiving. happy Turkey day everyone!</why><group><who>German expatriates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-expatriates-in-boston</urlname><id>57664</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>German Expatriates in Boston  Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1319116575000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>German Expatriates in Boston  Meetup Monthly Meetup</name><id>ddwxqyppbfc</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321488000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-expatriates-in-boston/events/38080702/</event_url></item>
