After about one mile, turn left onto Monsen Road. Continue on Monsen Road until you see the refuge entrance on your left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a ride? Please ask for one in your rsvp, saying what area you are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This original 250-acre area that belonged to Samuel Hoar is still known as the ?Great Meadows,? and is open to visitors. Several trails are available for wildlife observation, including the Dike Trail, a 2.7-mile loop around one of the marsh pools. Trailside interpretive signs and an observation tower provide visitors with additional views and information about the refuge, its management, and its wildlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a dish to share for the pic-nic, a blanket, and a cooler if you have one. People without coolers can store their food in someone else's cooler during the walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Andy for suggesting this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187620376000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183996655000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Meadows walk and pic nic</name><id>5996034</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187447400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5996034/</event_url></item>
