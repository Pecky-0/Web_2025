If you are wondering what is really going on over there, or would like to be more informed about the issue, or would like to know what many different kinds of experts are saying about this war, we invite you to join with us in viewing this film. We will most likely have a meaningful (and peaceful) conversation about the film afterward. &lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rethink Afghanistan&lt;/i&gt; is a ground-breaking, full-length documentary focusing on the key issues surrounding this war. This film was originally released in six parts (available for free viewing online), enabling the film-makers  to stay on top of news of the war as it has continued to unfold. The aim is to raise critical questions regarding Afghanistan that Congress must address in oversight hearings, which inform the public and challenge policymakers. &lt;br /&gt;1) Part One focuses on what military escalation will achieve in Afghanistan. &lt;br /&gt;2) Part Two looks at how the war could further destabilize a nuclear-armed Pakistan. &lt;br /&gt;3) Part Three focuses on the staggering costs of the war, which could easily exceed $1 trillion.&lt;br /&gt;4) Part Four examines the civilian casualties caused by recent U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan.&lt;br /&gt;5) Part Five questions the assumption that war can liberate Afghan women.&lt;br /&gt;6) Part Six brings you three former high-ranking CIA agents explaining why there is no &amp;quot;victory&amp;quot; to be won in Afghanistan.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
