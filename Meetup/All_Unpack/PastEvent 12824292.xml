The holistic conceptual framework of Intuitive Eating will be presented along with an overview of the 10 Key Principles on how to become an intuitive eater.  Participants will be guided through a practice to determine if they are eating intuitively and then explore different types of ‘unconscious eating’.  The intuitive eater is awakened gradually in six stages through learning the principles and then internalizing them through practices.   We will explore these stages and experience one of the many practices during this session.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda Marks</member_name><member_id>5692888</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284137271000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Alternative Health Practioners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>alternative-703</urlname><id>1152400</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2099990845</group_lon><name>Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268104507000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>September Boston Area Mind-Body Therapies Meetup</name><id>12824292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284132600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/alternative-703/events/12824292/</event_url></item>
