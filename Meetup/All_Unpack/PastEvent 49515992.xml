Besides canvassing and lit drops we're also looking at tabling / pamphleting gun shows in CT and Mass, possibly an advertising insert and several other ideas. We've had many great meetups for the 2012 campaign but few of an organizational nature. This will be a fun, social meetup while we set goals as a group and spread the ideas of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if we have the members for it but I'd like to make the meetings regularly occurring (bi-weekly to start) - we'll see what our turnout for Feb. 8th is first. I'm also open to moving the location or time if it will help members attend or if anyone has a good location idea. Wednesdays shouldn't be too busy at New England Pizza and if we have a large number rsvp I'll have them hold the large table in the back for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1328934144000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327462648000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>CT4Paul Social &amp; Organizational Meetup</name><id>49515992</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328571000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/49515992/</event_url></item>
