This elegantly beautiful film won the Best Film Award in the Seattle Film Festival and Outstanding Feature &amp;amp; Best Actor in the German Films Awards in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Blossoms is a poignant celebration of beauty, new beginnings, and the ultimate metaphor for the impermanence of life. It takes place in Japan during very special cherry blossom season. It deals with life/death with Buddhist concepts subtly interwoven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheery Blossoms will be shown on March 31 at 7:00 p.m. It is open to the general public free of charge at the Buttonwood Tree Performing Arts and Cultural Center at 605 Main Street, Middletown, Connecticut. &lt;a href="http://www.buttonwood.org/cgi/calendar.pl" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.buttonwood...&lt;/a&gt;.  There is plenty of free street parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the Buddhist Film Festival of Connecticut? It showcases cinemagraphic works that explore the Buddhist religious experience or take on Buddhist spiritual themes. All viewings are free of charge and are part of the our New England Institute of Buddhist Studies' (NEIBS) Buddhist Film Course.   One does not need to be a NEIBS student to attend. It is open to the general public. &lt;a href="http://dharmaquest.bffct.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://dharmaquest.bf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Film Festival 2010 Calendar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baraka - January&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Buddha - February&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Blossoms – March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the last film until the autumn 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visitor – October. This 2009 film did not get nearly enough attention- even though Richard Jenkins received Best Actor nomination for his performance.  The theme of film is &amp;quot;just connect&amp;quot;. It is a beautiful story of what can happen when lives intersect and people are willing and able to drop their story lines- and &amp;quot;just connect.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you can attend and lend support to our sangha and Buddhist culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please spread the word and bring some friends too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;visit our main web site at &lt;a href="http://www.bffct.net" target="_blank"&gt;www.bffct.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Senpai Daishin</member_name><member_id>5221830</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270249405000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Buddhists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>buddhism-563</urlname><id>797062</id><group_lat>41.5499992371</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6600036621</group_lon><name>Buddhist Faith Fellowship in Middletown, Ct</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267497120000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buddhist Film Festival 2010 - Cherry Blossoms - Best Actor &amp; Outstanding Film</name><id>12751626</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270076400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/buddhism-563/events/12751626/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/d/9/global_13413033.jpeg</photo_url></item>
