It's the latest from director Martin Scorcese with Leonardo DiCaprio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's playing at Blackstone Valley Cinema at 3:45 PM. I originally wanted to schedule a show for 5-ish, but 5:00 is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; in between the late-afternoon and the early-evening show. So I picked the late-afternoon show instead. I hope this doesn't inconvenience anyone who already RSVP'ed &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The movie is at 3:45. Let's meet in the theater lobby at 3:15.&lt;/b&gt; As usual, I will wear my Superman cap so you can recognize me. If you need to reach me, my cell phone number is 508-981-0455.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll get out of the movie just in time for dinner. Anyone who wants to can join me for dinner at one of the many restaurants in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- David&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary, courtesy of imdb.com&lt;br /&gt;When a psychotic killer (Mortimer) disappears from a mental institution on Shutter Island, a pair of U.S. Marshals (Ruffalo and DiCaprio) race against the clock in order to track her down.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear my superman cap</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267561446000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264980361000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Shutter Island</name><id>12477319</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267388100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/12477319/</event_url></item>
