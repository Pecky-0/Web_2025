So have fun. Nicolas mentioned Settlers for a game and I know some of you have been really enjoying that one lately, so I am assuming that will get played.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO please come, play, and forget there is only 5 more shopping days till Christmas after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can not make it, I am foregoing the normal $1 suggested donation. Use that for a stocking stuffer, or if not a Christmas celebrated, I strongly suggest using it as a downpayment on a hot cup of coffee, tea, cocoa, etc......&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198281696000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197754306000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night at Nicolas' request</name><id>6918243</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198108800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/6918243/</event_url></item>
