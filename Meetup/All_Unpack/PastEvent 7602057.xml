A little fresh air and some exercise and/or checking out some cute tall singles will definitely raise your heart rate nicely....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet outside Cheers (which is inside the Hampshire House) ON THE STREET @ 11.30am - this is an easy spot to find, therefore a good place for us to meet up to begin the Walk. But we won't do brunch there, too many tourists...:).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll walk around Beacon Hill for 45 minutes or so, ending with brunch at Beacon Hill Bistro on Charles Street.&lt;br /&gt;We'll have a pre-planned route (thanks to bostonwalk.org) and you'll be given your own copy of the map and route notes for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brunch will be at 1 pm (for those that want to skip the walk &amp;amp; head straight for the food &amp;amp; mimosas...!).&lt;br /&gt;After brunch - optional extra = torture your credit card on Newbury Street. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****  PLEASE NOTE!!  PLEASE NOTE!!  ****&lt;br /&gt;**** RSVP is mandatory for this event ****&lt;br /&gt;**** This is so that we can reserve the right-sized table for brunch &amp;amp; have enough maps to hand out ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can RSVP Maybe initially, but you will need to commit to either a Yes or a No the day before the event (4/26)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of the walk is free; you are responsible for paying for your own brunch.&lt;br /&gt;For more info on the Beacon Hill Bistro and to view their menus, go to &lt;a href="http://www.beaconhillbistro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Beacon Hill Hotel &amp;amp; Bistro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209483666000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Cute, cultured, tall singles will be there; and the brunch is fantastic too!</why><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206489512000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beacon Hill Brownstone Meander &amp; Brunch</name><id>7602057</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209310200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/7602057/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/b/global_3153499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
