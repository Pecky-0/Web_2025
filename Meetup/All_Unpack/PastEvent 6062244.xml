This year, the Coolidge Corner theater is showing car themed movieson the Great Lawn in front of the Auto Museum in Larz Anderson Park. Before the film there will be car displays, food vendors and community booths to visit. This will be a fun kick-off for the drive-in movie, and a way for people who can't make it to the drive-in to still be able to enjoy the outdoor movie experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be seeing the third and last film in this summer series, Back to the Future. This event will be hosted by Nicole. Look for the picnic blanket with red balloons around it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it'd be a good idea if people brought blankets or chairs for sitting and snacks/non-aloholic drinks for the group to share. Note: Per the town of Brookline, this is a non-alcoholic event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film details and directions can be found below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty McFly, a typical 1980s teenager, is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a plutonium-powered DeLorean &amp;quot;time machine&amp;quot; invented by slightly mad scientist, Doc Brown. During his often hysterical, always amazing trip back in time, Marty must make certain his teenage parents-to-be meet and fall in love -- so he can get back to the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1985) dir. Robert Zemeckis, w/ Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, 1h46m&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Boston/North Shore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 93 South to Storrow Drive. Take the Fenway exit. Follow Outbound /Riverway signs to Boylston Street (taking a right off the ramp). Boylston St. will merge onto Brookline Ave. Follow Brookline Ave. to the Riverway/Jamaica Way intersection. Turn left onto the Riverway (this will turn into the Jamaica Way). You will go through the intersection with Perkins Street (Max Warburg Sq.) and Jamaica Pond will appear on your right. Go 1/2 way around the rotary (Kelley Circle) and at the lights turn right onto Pond Street. Pond Street will turn into Newton Street. The museum is located in Larz Anderson Park on the right about a 1/2 mile from the rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from West (Rte. 128/ I-95)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Rte. 128/ I-95 to Rte. 9 towards Boston. You will eventually pass the Chestnut Hill Mall on your left. Six lights after the Mall, you come to a major intersection (approx. 5 miles from Rte 128/ Rte. 9 intersection). Take a right onto Lee St. (If you pass the reservoir on Rte. 9 you?ve gone to far). Follow Lee to it?s end. This is Newton St. Turn left onto Newton St. Stay to the right around the bend. The museum is in Larz Anderson Park which is 1/4 mile on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Boston/South Shore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Rte. 3/ I-93 to exit 11. Granite Ave/Ashmont. Follow Granite Ave north to second traffic light, then turn left onto Rte. 203. Follow Rte. 203 (also called Gallivan and later Morton Blvd.) to the rotary where the Arborway and Rte. 203 meet. Follow the Arborway for 1/2 mile, merging left with traffic. You will come to a third rotary (Kelley Circle). Follow the rotary 3/4 of the way around to the light, effectively reversing your direction. Turn right onto Pond Street which becomes Newton Street. The museum is located in the park on the right 1/2 mile from the rotary. You have gone too far if Jamaica Pond is on your left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions using Public Transportation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the Green Line D to Reservoir or Green Line C to Cleveland Circle. From either Forest or Reservoir/Cleveland Circle take bus # 51.

Newton will bear right. (Goddard bears left) The Museum is 1/4 of a mile up on left. (The #51 bus does not operate on Sundays.)
