But the taste they make when you put them together is a delicious taste all its own.  But don't take my word for it, come taste for yourself at Watch City when they open the taps on their newest beer - Chocolate Thunder Porter, made with TAZA Chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Watch City Brewing, they were the first brewery ever to win a Medal for a &amp;quot;Chocolate Beer&amp;quot; style beer at the Great American Beer Festival in 1999! Brewer Aaron Mateychuk will be tapping the first batch of many on the 27th around 3:00 p.m. so don't miss out! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Chocolate Thunder Porter:&lt;br /&gt;It was made with 55 pounds of locally produced &amp;quot;Taza Chocolate&amp;quot; in Somerville, MA. you bet ...Keep it LOCAL! We added &amp;quot;70% Taza Dark Stone Ground Chocolate&amp;quot; in different points of the brewing process to balance out any bitterness along the way. The final touch was added with using 5 pounds of &amp;quot;Taza Chocolate Mexicano Vanilla Bean&amp;quot; chocolate inline in the conditioning process to overwhelm you with the chocolate experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(courtesy of Watch City Brewing)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, in other words, your chocolate is in my beer!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239934072000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237828666000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Your Chocolate Is In My Beer!</name><id>10016578</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238194800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/10016578/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/0/global_7807792.jpeg</photo_url></item>
