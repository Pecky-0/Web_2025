Join us for a very unique experience where we'll learn how to cook an authentic, homemade Italian meal followed by a scrumptious feast!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becky Brown is a culinary instructor of Italian cooking at Manchester Community College.  She has lived, worked and trained in Italy and has graciously offered to teach us how to cook some of her favorite Italian dishes at her home in Manchester.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;Cost is $40/person and must be paid in advance.  Each participant will be asked to bring a bottle of their favorite Italian wine.  Recipes for all dishes prepared will be handed out to those that attend. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menu includes:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Veal Saltimbocca (saut√©ed veal, prosciutto, sage and white wine)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Asparagus risotto  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fig and herb stuffed pork chops with apple reduction  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cappuccino panna cotta with chocolate whipped cream &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;~ Important Notes ~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Paid, First Reserved &lt;br /&gt;Space is limited to 10 people (including instructor) &lt;br /&gt;There will be absolutely NO REFUNDS for any reason! &lt;br /&gt;Menu may be subject to change at instructor's discretion &lt;br /&gt;The exact location in Manchester will be sent once you pre-pay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please sign up on the &amp;quot;Waiting List&amp;quot; and your RSVP will be changed to &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; once your check is received.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/center&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the instructor: &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;In Italy, Becky worked in Orvieto which is the Umbrian region of Italy. Most of her techniques have a direct relationship with ingredients and cooking methods that she learned while there.
