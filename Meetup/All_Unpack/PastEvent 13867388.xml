Come down to Aspire for some fun and good cheer, as we wish her well and toast her good-bye! *sniff*. Aspire has big windows, and a large central bar that make this restaurant a fun airy place with a warm, but contemporary atmosphere. They have a lovely outside patio too. Its a great place to go on a summer night AND they have jazz on the roof on Fridays! The drinks and appetizers are good too, so let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing some kind of scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
