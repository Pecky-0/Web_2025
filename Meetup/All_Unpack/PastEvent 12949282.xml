Join players of all levels as we work on our swing, serve, volleys, and other tennis skills.  We are here to have fun and get back in the swing of things.  If you are looking for a competitive game (so early?) then this is not the event for you.  Today is all about getting back in the swing of things, doing some conditioning exercises, practicing our shots, having some rallies and getting to know one another.  If some folks want to play a game or two as the event progresses that is up to them to do so.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School offers plenty of opportunity to play tennis on its 6 tennis courts and two practice backboards.  Courts are available for up to 2 hours.  The BHS Tennis Teams and those w/ permits have priority over residents who all have priority over non-residents.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please Note: This is NOT instructional.  Therefore, you should have a basic knowledge of the game, how to use the racket, know the rules and know how to volley.  Ideally, you should be at least a 1.5 or Advance Beginner.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spring Into Tennis!&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, April 15th, 2010 @ 6-7:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School Tennis Courts&lt;br /&gt;128 Town Street&lt;br /&gt;(Enter off Franklin St/Route 37)&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meeting Place&lt;/i&gt;: Tennis courts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Event Organizer(s)&lt;/i&gt;: Chandra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Min/Max&lt;/i&gt;: Min of 6 participants by 12pm on Thu, April 15th in order for this event to take place.
