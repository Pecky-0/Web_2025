Andrew here. Let's have February's meetup somewhere new. Mama Teresa's has good seating, lots of food, and is only a block or two away from Tazza. (Say you went to Tazza by accident. To meet us, start with Tazza to your right--on the right side of Westminster Street--then walk a block and a half on Westminster toward the river, and you'll see Mama Teresa's on your left.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS [from Chris]: I've added an OPTIONAL $1 donation starting with this month's event. It costs about $15 per month to run the group website - if you find value in these meetups and would like to help out please donate, however it is NOT a prerequisite for attending our events. You can submit your donation via PayPal or to me directly at March's meetup event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Shearer</member_name><member_id>1529786</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1171127282000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Web Developers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>webdesign-410</urlname><id>272511</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Providence Web Development Lunch Hour Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168539058000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Providence Web Development Lunch Hour February Meetup</name><id>5385490</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1170954000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/webdesign-410/events/5385490/</event_url></item>
