Callahan has seven miles of marked trails and is used for activities including fishing, hiking, horseback riding and cross-country skiing. Within the park are nearly 100 acres of open fields, 70 acres of which are currently under an agricultural lease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I can tell on the map the Millwood Parking area is probably the easiest to get to, so we will meet there. If anyone knows the park well and would like to help lead this hike. Please feel free to email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's plan to hike for about 2 hours at a moderate pace. Please bring water and snacks for you and your pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event could be cancelled due to weather. Please pay attention to your emails the night before the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I am tall with short hair and I drive a green Chevy pickup</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Luis </member_name><member_id>6933069</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1270519588000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dog-hiking</urlname><id>1123750</id><group_lat>42.2299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8899993896</group_lon><name>Dog hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269294293000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Callahan State Park in Framingham: Wonderland for Dogs and People, too!</name><id>12960853</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269702000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dog-hiking/events/12960853/</event_url></item>
