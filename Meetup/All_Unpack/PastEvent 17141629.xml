This was a behind the scenes look at a day in the life of clubhouse employees, managers, grounds crew, bat boys and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched parts of a few MLB opening day games, sacrificed a Natives Virgin, traded tickets, coached Fran thru her next break up, met new guy Carter and learned all about Rick's ruptured tendon. Then it was off to the Bleacher Bar to disrupt&amp;nbsp;Tonya's and Isabelle's Trivingo Team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a late and crazy night returning home in a snow storm on Opening Day. What a way to start the 2011 Season!&lt;/p&gt;
