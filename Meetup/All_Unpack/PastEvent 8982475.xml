Take one thing and stuff it with another thing or three. November we start stuffing ourselves into coats and gloves, we begin to stuff our closets with hidden presents and of course we stuff turkeys and eat stuffing and just plain get stuffed to the point of opening that button in our waistband.&lt;br /&gt;Join us this month with your favorite stuffed recipe.  Bring the stuff you need and cook onsite.  The kitchen will be filled with people cooking and chatting. The wine glasses will be filled to the brim, tummies will get stuffed full.  And the company will bring an abundance of good cheer fulfilling all friendly inclinations.&lt;br /&gt;This is the stuff memories are made of…see you on Friday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the drill…&lt;br /&gt;Plan to assemble or cook on site unless your dish takes more than an hour to prepare. Bring any special equipment but I have standard kitchen tools and supplies.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236976965000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224288695000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes November Meetup</name><id>8982475</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227312000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/8982475/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/a/global_5979546.jpeg</photo_url></item>
