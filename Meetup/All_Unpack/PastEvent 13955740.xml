We hope it works for some of you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will provide a main course. . . probably kebabs. . . and at least one side dish. We'll also have plates, cutlery, etc., and a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Your RSVP fee will cover some of the cost of these things. The rest of the food will be up to you! Salads, desserts, hors d'oeuvres, and anything else you can think of . . . just bring SOMETHING and bring enough of it to feed at least 4 people, preferably more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch for updates as we zero in on recipes and hear from others about what they would like to bring. Hopefully we can avoid duplications. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Directions will be sent to you when you RSVP.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob</member_name><member_id>4061181</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278557575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277864166000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cooperative Barbecue Chez Zinck -- NEW LATER START TIME DUE TO THE HEAT!</name><id>13955740</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278356400000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/13955740/</event_url></item>
