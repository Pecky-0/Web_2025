Kinsman Trail to the Kinsman Ridge Trail to North Kinsman and then South Kinsman &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(10.0 miles RT 3,900' gain allow 8+ hours - distance between the peaks is just under 1 mile).    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really pretty hike with nice views along the ridge trail and peaks.  Dogs welcome.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mt. Kinsman Trailhead Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take the Franconia exit of I-93 (Exit 38).  Go left off that off-ramp.&lt;br /&gt;From the east side of Rte 116 at Franconia - Easton Town Line it is 4.3 miles south of NH 18 in Franconia Village and 2 miles east of the Easton Town Hall.  The sign for the Town Hall is a few yards north of the trail but the trail itself does not have a sign. The trial follows a logging road at a prominent chain link gate across 2 stone pillars opposite a building with a large garage and a few hundred yards past a bown 'historic marker' sign.   You have to park off  to the side of the road.&lt;br /&gt; you RSVP and keep your response up to date.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>If you want the details, please contact [url=mailto:anderblit@earthlink.net]Judi</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222174438000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221596189000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Kinsmans</name><id>8770179</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222001100000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/8770179/</event_url></item>
