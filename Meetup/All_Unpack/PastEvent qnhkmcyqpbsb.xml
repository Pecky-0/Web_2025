<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the new Mandarin/Cantonese PlayDate that will alternate in exposing our children to the Mandarin and Cantonese Languages.  It is co-hosted (experimentally for now) by MJ who is a native and fluent speaker in both Mandarin and Cantonese.  And I help provide the informal educational components in the form of a short group activity appropriate for all ages to promote the learning and use of the languages.  We strive to make Mandarin and Cantonese accessible to all levels!  So don't be shy!  We can all learn together with our kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This week, we will have story-time in Mandarin.&lt;/strong&gt; We will start this around 10:45am.  The activity this week will be &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;a simple craft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that will help with learning a song to sing in Mandarin!  Very easy to do for tots and even easier for Moms of infants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids can always free-play as desired.  If you have DVDs to share or information on links to videos in Chinese that are appropriate for babies and young toddlers to view, please bring them to share!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breastfeeding-friendly environment!  Bring your baby's bottle/fomula or your tots lunch if you want to stay for lunch together. (And your own lunch too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check back often before we meet!  I will update the activity once it's been decided. And I may change our location from time to time either for variety, a field-trip or just because another member would like a chance to co-host at their home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993300"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;When you RSVP, I assume you're coming with your child!  If you have 2 kids or more, please add them to your RSVP so I know how many kids will be participating.  Thanks!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Elsie's Cell:  508-202-0097 (okay to txt me)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elsie Smits</member_name><member_id>17363801</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354491172000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Parents &amp; Kiddies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>1371768</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Asian-American Families of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350697748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mandarin/Cantonese PlayDate</name><id>qnhkmcyqpbsb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353079800000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-Families-of-GreaterBoston/events/87766712/</event_url></item>
