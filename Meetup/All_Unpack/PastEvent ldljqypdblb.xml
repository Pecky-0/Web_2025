Sharing dreams in a group provides a rich source of material to work with in understanding the many layers of your dreams from many perspectives. It is always an ideal time to gather together and share dreams you have had with others, to get ideas on what your dreams mean and to guide you into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What dreams or visions have been calling you for understanding and interpreting? The synchronicities that occur, the themes and connections that happen, in a group sharing dreams and visions are often quite profound. Come, share, explore, learn, and grow with the knowledge and wisdom of our intrepid dream adventurers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payment is $10 and can be made online or in person. Anyone who cannot afford to pay is encouraged to attend anyway and should contact the group organizer &lt;a href="http://www.bostondreamers.com/message/?recipientId=7399016" target="_blank"&gt;Deerheart&lt;/a&gt; before attending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event will be from 7 pm until 9 pm. Space is limited to 15 people. RSVP requested. Please update your RSVP if you are unable to attend, to allow others to attend.
