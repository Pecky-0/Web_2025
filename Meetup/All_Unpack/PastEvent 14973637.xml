Hope all of you are doing well.  Velvet and I missed seeing you in August and September.  Now that things have settled down, we're ready to get back to the meetups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's meet up will be on Sunday, October 17th from 11am to 1pm.  We will have a Halloween Celebration, so bring those puggies in costumes.  We'll have a prize for the best costume and see if anyone wants to bob for apples this year (not too many puggies were interested in getting wet for apples last year!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone would like to schedule a grooming for after the meeting, please let me know ahead of time so I can be sure my groomer is here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone attending for the first time, please check in at the front desk and be sure to bring proof of updated vaccines for the rabies, distemper and canine cough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agni&lt;br /&gt;781.245.1237&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Agni</member_name><member_id>8450793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287421139000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Pug Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Pug-Lovers</urlname><id>1340523</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Pug Lovers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286031307000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>OCTOBER MEET UP - HALLOWEEN CELEBRATION</name><id>14973637</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287327600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Pug-Lovers/events/14973637/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/3/1/global_7475937.jpeg</photo_url></item>
