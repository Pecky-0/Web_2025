&lt;p&gt;PRESENTATION DETAILS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Foursquare reaches its 10 millionth user, consumers, marketers and small business owners are still struggling to find the value in location-based services. The potential is great, but how to unlock this potential to reach consumers effectively at the point of purchase, event participation, or during everyday activities? Location-based services raise the potential of marketing to consumers in much less intrusive way than many other channels, including most other forms of social media. You can provide immediately relevant messages and offers to customers when they are near your venue, help museum and other cultural attraction visitors gain better insight into what they're seeing, and promote events in real time. For individuals, location-based services provide the opportunity to select the messages they receive from vendors, yes, but also socialize in entirely new ways that are both more intentional and more spontaneous. Join authors Aaron Strout and Mike Schneider as they explore this most social of all media, and its effect on social groups, businesses, and messaging now and in the future.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;This tweetup is also the endpoint of the CheckInVitational, an invitation-only scavenger hunt around Harvard Square from 6-7pm for teams made up of marketing departments, agencies, and independent marketers.
