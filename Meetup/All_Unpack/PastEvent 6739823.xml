I won a free dinner for 10 people! Technically it was lunch but they agreed to let us do it for dinner time. If you are interested please RSVP with yes - only if you are 100% positive you can make it. I am also posting this to my &lt;a href="http://www.newenglandphotographynetwork.com" target="_blank"&gt;New England Photography Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.30somethingboston.com" target="_blank"&gt;30 Something Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nuttingslakeonline.com" target="_blank"&gt;Nuttings Lake Association&lt;/a&gt; meetup groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you run a group and want to post it to your calendar please let me know how many people confirm yes by upping your RSVP number and putting it in your RSVP comments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention free meal of your choice and non-alcohol drinks. You can get alcohol they just can't include it in the free meal for legal reasons ... &lt;a href="http://www.gingerpad.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.gingerpad....&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers, Eileen &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passionate Foodie comments: &lt;a href="http://passionatefoodie.blogspot.com/2007/05/ginger-pad.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://passionatefood...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197558163000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195054113000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NEPN: Free Dinner at Ginger Pad!!</name><id>6739823</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196809200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/6739823/</event_url></item>
