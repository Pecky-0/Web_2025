These days, Usability and User Experience are very crucial to success, and can mean the difference between making it or breaking it. I've seen so many sites that fail, only because they did not focus on Usability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usability&lt;/b&gt; is a measure of the quality of a personâ€™s experience in interacting with content or services.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us as Steve Krug takes us through an in-depth look at web usability and how to measure it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve is a leading expert on web usability and is the author of two famous books named &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html" target="_blank"&gt;DON'T MAKE ME THINK&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.sensible.com/rocketsurgery/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;ROCKET SURGERY MADE EASY&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. In these books, Steve teaches the fundamentals of Usability, and how to apply them to your projects easily with Usability Testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll take you through why you need to care about Usability, real life examples, as well as how to perform Usability testing on your own site. If your a designer, coder, entrepreneur, then you will want to attend this. We will also arrange to have Steve do a live usability test on an open source* project and volunteer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You need to attend:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed Steve for years and have seen all of his talks and presentations. I can tell you that you will love this event, and you will walk away with a new outlook. We'll also raffle several of Steve's books for those that attend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Now before it fills up! In the meantime, I urge you to grab a copy of the book. If you have a eBook reader, you can read the first &lt;a href="http://www.sensible.com/chapter.html" target="_blank"&gt;chapter for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Booth Camp:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the socializing hour from 6-7, we will setup some booths where we will have experts offering PHP tech support, Members asking advice on their own app, Members giving a show/tell demo of something their doing with PHP Technology. Our hope is that this will make good use of the social hour, and get our members more engaged with each other.

If you would like to submit your open source project/site, then please submit your site &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/9969357"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agenda:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6:00 - 7:00 : Doors open, socializing, &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/9979927"&gt;Booth Camp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7:00 - 7:15 : Announcements &lt;br /&gt;7:15 - 8:45 : Presentation &lt;br /&gt;8:45 - 9:00 : Questions &lt;br /&gt;9:00 - ???? : Beers somewhere?&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ronald Verge</member_name><member_id>4075991</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt Murphy</member_name><member_id>4790321</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Bourque</member_name><member_id>5046031</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew Drane</member_name><member_id>8266401</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Krug</member_name><member_id>12248696</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292458807000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>83</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonphp</urlname><id>120818</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston PHP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>349</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275694278000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Usability with Steve Krug</name><id>13701966</id><headcount>300</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290034800000</time><rsvp_limit>372</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/13701966/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/1/5/global_19583141.jpeg</photo_url></item>
