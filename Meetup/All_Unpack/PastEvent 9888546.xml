In addition to our regular second-Tuesday meetups, there will be another meetup once every four weeks on a Saturday afternoon.  This is the first installation of the Boston Bookcrossing Saturday Chapter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come for lunch, or come for coffee, but definitely come for the conversation.  On the agenda is our regular book-themed schmoozing and smorgasbord of bookcrossing-registered books. (&lt;a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bookcrossi...&lt;/a&gt;)  This location has free wi-fi, so if you forget to register your books or you're not sure how, you can register them on the spot.  (Bringing books is optional.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're trying out this venue for our first Saturday Chapter, and may change it if necessary, so be sure to double-check the meeting location next time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New members are always welcome! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have a small sign with the Ballycumber Bookcrossing logo</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liz</member_name><member_id>220016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239753248000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236275038000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Bookcrossing March Meetup -- Saturday Chapter</name><id>9888546</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238263200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/9888546/</event_url></item>
