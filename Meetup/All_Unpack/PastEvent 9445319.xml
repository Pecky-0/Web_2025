There's an indoor roller skating rink in Saugus called &lt;a href="http://www.roller-world.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Roller World&lt;/a&gt;.  Admission is $7.00 and includes a roller skate rental.  If you want to rent rollerblades it's $3.00.  You can also bring your own skates.  Somewhere in my basement I know I have a pair of &amp;quot;sneaker&amp;quot; roller skates.  Yeah, skating in a circle can get monotonous so I thought I'd tack on dinner.  There's a Border Cafe nearby (yeah, like the one in Harvard Square) so we can get some Mexican food afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always try to organized T-accessible events and even though this is in Saugus it is.  From Wellington station on the Orange line you can take bus 101 and then switch to bus 429.  You can log onto www.mbta.com and use the address above for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you driving, it's on the south bound side of Route 1 behind Honey Baked Hams.  If you miss that entrance from Route 1 you can also reach the parking lot from the KFC or Taco Bells parking lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your plans change, please update your RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Inside front entry way on the left</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dee</member_name><member_id>4101956</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235784135000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Inline / Roller / Ice Skaters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-inline-roller-ice-skating</urlname><id>569309</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Skating</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231122541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indoor Rollerskating and Mexican Food</name><id>9445319</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234731600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-inline-roller-ice-skating/events/9445319/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/4/8/global_6844168.jpeg</photo_url></item>
