No pressure to speak completely in Portuguese.  You can become comfortable by just listening then jump in when you're ready to talk. We will meet until at least 8:30 PM....maybe longer if the conversation is flowing....so get there when you can, just please RSVP and let us know when you will arrive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;RSVP EARLY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; because seating is limited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: brown"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please PLEASE Please answer the questions, so our reservation is accurate and conversations are balanced. THANK YOU!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Algiers is a quiet, cozy, friendly place with a variety of tasty dishes for carnivores as well as vegetarians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to eat or just drink, while we chat. Here is the &lt;a href="http://www.harvardsquare.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=45165708-59fa-48c1-83f4-69d3da6d0887" target="_blank"&gt;Algiers Menu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;There will &lt;span style="color: brown"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; be a group bill. &lt;br /&gt;Our waitress will write individual bills for which you are expected to pay at the cash register&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime ago in separate conversations Ramzi and Alvaro suggested we have simple lessons during our Portuguese Table. If there is an interest, we could play a game which can also serve as an ice breaker. Each person has five cards and the object of the game is to be the person with the most cards after five statements have been made, in Portuguese of course. The statement is &amp;quot;I have never....&amp;quot; and then you complete the sentence. For example, &amp;quot;I have never learned how to fly a plane.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Nunca aprendi como voar um avi√£o.&amp;quot; Then those who know how to fly a plane would put a card in the middle of the table. Then the next person will say &amp;quot;I have never....&amp;quot; and so on and so on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're not required to take part, you're welcome to have individual conversations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MBTA: &lt;br /&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://mbta.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hopstop.com/?city=boston" target="_blank"&gt;Hop Stop&lt;/a&gt; to plan your public transportation route.
