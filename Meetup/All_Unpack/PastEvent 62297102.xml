&lt;p&gt;Travels with My Aunt by Graham Greene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Described by Graham Greene as "the only book I have written just for the fun of it." Travels with My Aunt is the story of Hanry Pulling, a retired and complacent bank manager, who meets his septuagenarian Aunt Augusta for the first time at what he supposes to be his mother's funeral. She soon persuades Henry to abandon his dull suburban existence to travel her way—to Brighton, Paris, Istanbul, Paraguay. Through Aunt Augusta, one of Greene's greatest comic creations, Henry joins a shiftless, twilight society; mixes with hippies, war criminals, and CIA men; smokes pot; and breaks all currency regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published in 1970, Travels with My Aunt gives us an intoxicating entertainment yet also confronts us with some of the most perplexing of human dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
