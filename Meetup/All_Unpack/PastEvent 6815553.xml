Once in the U.S., the film crew went with them to a string of cities that included Miami; the Bronx; York, Pennsylvania; Grand Isle, Nebraska; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and a host of other places to which the lives of these immigrants carried them. Seven years later, the film crew visits them again, to discover what their destiny has been in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;Questions: Contact Karen Dworski 860-922-7997, kdwo543210@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret Vincent</member_name><member_id>1777042</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197231251000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Spanish Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spanish-93</urlname><id>145906</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Hartford Spanish Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196217282000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tertulia: La pelicula: Balseros (Cuban Rafters)</name><id>6815553</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196898300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spanish-93/events/6815553/</event_url></item>
