Please join me for the opening night!  The hall is absolutely beautiful, and the acoustics are amazing.  I will always try to sit in the left-middle balcony section, since it affords a good view of the orchestra, and any pianist's hands should there be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening's program will be performed by the NEC Philharmonia orchestra, and will  be conducted by Hugh Wolff, the NEC's director of Orchestras.   &lt;a href="http://necmusic.edu/hugh-wolff-conducts-nec-philharmonia" target="_blank"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the link to the event on the NEC website.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concert starts at 8pm, but let's meet up at 7:30, so we have a chance to socialize before the concert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;FYI:&lt;/span&gt;  To include my &amp;quot;social fun&amp;quot; regulars, I've also scheduled a pre-concert dinner at Pho and I on their calendar; please consider joining me for a quick bite before the concert.
