 Happy New Year!! Since the people I have heard from don't seem to have a problem with Mondays, I have decided to change the meet up day to Mondays, still at 6. I hope that works for everyone else as well!! We had a great meet up before Christmas and I hope we can continue to increase the size of our group!!! Also, if anyone would like to run any other days during the week, please let me know. I am running a half marathon in March and I would love to have training buddies!! Thanks guys!! See you next week!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maura </member_name><member_id>12474272</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357610857000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Runners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NewHavenRunners</urlname><id>426798</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Runners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1357089054000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Track workout!!!</name><id>97380342</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357599600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NewHavenRunners/events/97380342/</event_url></item>
