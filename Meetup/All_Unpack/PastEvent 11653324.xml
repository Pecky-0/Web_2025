<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a great time for shrooming. I typically go looking for tree mushrooms and drive the roads looking for dead or dying trees around Columbus Day for about two weeks. I love trekking through the woods looking at nature but don't dare eat many of the ground shrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would like to go for a ride or a walk (maybe both)? Let's talk via email about where to go. We can meet at a state forest or park and walk through the woods or drive the back roads of MA, NH &amp;amp; ME...I'm up for anything.
