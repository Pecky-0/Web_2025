<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We'll meet at Cider Hill Farm at noon.&amp;nbsp; I'll have a sign "Old Ladies Travel"&amp;nbsp; Then we'll pick fruit for awhile.&amp;nbsp; Right now, according to their website apples, peaches and a few raspberries are ripe for picking.&amp;nbsp; Cider Hill provides containers for us and also a picking guide so we know what's ripe.&amp;nbsp; They charge by the pound (but I don't know how much per pound).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm making a reservation at the Amesbury Flatbread Company for a late lunch.&amp;nbsp; They use produce from Cider Hill.&amp;nbsp; They have all types of flatbread pizza, salads and desserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: Cider Hill also has honey bees on the farm so if anyone has an allergy come prepared just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send me any questions you may have and I'll see you on Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;
