Attendance is always free and open to anyone interested in learning about Microsoft .NET technologies. Directions are below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Presentation Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this presentation, you will learn how to build a website with DotNetNuke 5.0. DotNetNuke is a free, open-source web application platform that allows developers to build very powerful websites - very efficiently - using commercially available extensions and/or custom developed .NET extensions. This presentation will primarily focus on using DotNetNuke &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot;, without much customization. We will explore the most important core functionality that developers leverage, and we will also explore features that site admins use to manage their sites. We will discuss the rich community and ecosystem that has gathered around DotNetNuke, the largest open-source .NET project on the planet. After this presentation, you will be armed with enough knowledge to build your own website with DotNetNuke.&lt;br /&gt;Find out more about DotNetNuke here: &lt;a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Presenter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Caron is MassMutual's professional .NET leader and also the leader of the Western Mass. .NET Users Group.
