<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The encore production of the Metropolitan Opera's Simon Boccanegra  by Giuseppe Verdi will be at the Fenway, February 24.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are around $18.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this production Placido Domingo, one of the world's greatest tenors, will make history singing the title role in Verdi’s gripping political thriller, which is written for a baritone.   Adrianne Pieczonka, Marcello Giordani, and James Morris are his co-stars in this moving and tragic story of a father and his lost daughter. James Levine conducts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conductor: James Levine; Production: Giancarlo del Monaco; Adrianne Pieczonka, Marcello Giordani, Plácido Domingo, James Morris&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These productions have been spectacular  - - in many ways better than a live performance.  I hope that we will meet ahead of time at 5:30 for a quick bite someplace close to the theater.  If you want to go, you will need to buy your ticket ahead of time as this can sell out.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in the theater lobby before the show, wearing a white down jacket.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Shirley</member_name><member_id>3404432</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265392557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Placido Domingo and Verdi, February 24</name><id>12528403</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267054200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/12528403/</event_url></item>
