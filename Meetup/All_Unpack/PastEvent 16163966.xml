It's amazing how the humor of these animated stories hold up over time.  Seeing it on the big screen with some snacks and a cup of beer....well how could I resist setting this up as a meetup?   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be outside the brattle by 7:30 wearing a meetup pin and carrying a meetup sign.    Show time is at 8.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly advise you to buy your tickets in advance as shows at the brattle frequently sell out.   The link for buying tickets is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&amp;amp;e=cedba8b14109ff72985c0d748e341df9" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.vendini.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sixteenth Annual!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A school vacation treat for kids and fun-loving adults alike, the Brattle’s BUGS BUNNY FILM FESTIVAL has been delighting audiences for well over a decade! Join us this year as we offer the traditional ALL BUGS REVUE, starring everyone’s favorite wascally wabbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be outside the theater at 7:30 until they let us inside,  Probably about 7:45 or so.
