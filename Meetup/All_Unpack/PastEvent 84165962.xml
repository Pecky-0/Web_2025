&lt;p&gt;I've been to Howl at the moon before and I had a great time. This place can get packed pretty quickly.I do recommend getting there early, so you will beat the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is a bit tricky in the finacial district. You will have to look for a garage or on street parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the MBTA riders, there are multple T stations near by such as South Station, Down Town Crossing, and State Street. The walking time varies from 8 to 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
