It's a big wildlife area with lots of hiking trails and ponds. Bring the kids and dogs and we'll enjoy some nature. We can change the date and place if needed, this was the first thing that popped into my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian V.
