Zombie Attacks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music!  Ceramic Bowls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in years past, the Steelyard will be hosting the Iron Guild as they execute some molten iron casting, usually with some sort of zombie or appropriately themed story worked into the pour.  In past years the castings have been a set of giant, skeletal wings that were then mounted next to a wooden head and a mold made of sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a ceramic bowl sale, to benefit the Steelyard and its artists in residence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open at 6PM, Performance begins at 7PM, Music by The Empty House Cooperative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost is $7 entry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll have my phone for coordination if people arrive at different times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking for the event is on Harris Ave and Sims Ave.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be near the front gate at 6:30.
