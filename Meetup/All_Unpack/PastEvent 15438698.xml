I will show up around noon most likely, but you are more than welcome to go at 10am and do what you can. I think it would be a great idea to be out there handing out flyers and DVDs and spreading the truth about the vaccines and big pharma. This is a very good place to demonstrate because of it's proximity to a lot of colleges. We have many new members over the past couple weeks. Let's get out there and do something! Make flyers, burn DVDs, make signs if you want, bring a bullhorn if you have one. Let's bring down this matrix one step at a time!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290277120000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>WeAreChangeBoston</urlname><id>388713</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0199966431</group_lon><name>We Are Change Boston / Boston 9/11 Truth</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289694710000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Flu Shot Awareness Demonstration at Whittier Street Health Center</name><id>15438698</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290272400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WeAreChangeBoston/events/15438698/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/2/8/global_19594392.jpeg</photo_url></item>
