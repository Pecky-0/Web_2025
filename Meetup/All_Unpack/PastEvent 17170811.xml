I can set up two topropes, Let me know in your RSVP if you can set up some. Also let me know if anyone needs a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday - Weather looks good with temps in the 60s and no rain. I plan to get their early, by 8:30, to grab a spot. I will send an email on friday with my cell # so you all can call me when you get to the cliffs. Also, give me a call or send me an email if you need a ride, or post a message on this board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should at least have yours own harness and shoes. It looks like we will have enough ropes. I would prefer if everyone has at least taken the basic belay class at a local gym. If you are an absolutely brand new climber with no experience or gear whatsoever, please send me an email to see if we can fit you in. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good place for beginners who have climbed at a gym but never climbed outside before.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a red down coat.
