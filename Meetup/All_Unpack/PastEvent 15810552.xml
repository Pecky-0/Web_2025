It was their love of folk music that brought them together and has since taken them out on the road to tour fulltime as the award-winning duet they are today.&lt;br /&gt;     Writing and singing in the veins of folk, old country music, and bluegrass, the Dewdrops entwine harmony singing with tight instrumentation and craft songs that are simple and fine-tuned. Theirs are new songs from the southern mountains that ring with originality.&lt;br /&gt;     After their appearance and first place win on a 2008 talent show broadcast of NPR’s “A Prairie Home Companion”, the Dewdrops began their careers as songwriters and have since released two critically acclaimed albums, “If the Sun Will Shine” (2009) and “These Old Roots” (2010) both of which have charted at the #1 and #2 positions on the Folk DJ-L Charts for 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thehoneydewdrops.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thehoneyde...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no charge / free parking&lt;br /&gt;Main library is across from Green, corner of Elm and Temple.
