I have attended lectures in this series before, and they are always well done.&amp;nbsp; For those of you not familiar with the series:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Broad institute's Midsummer Nights' Science is an annual lecture series that explores key advances in genomic research. This lecture series is held each summer, and is free and open to the general public. Midsummer Nights' Science at the Broad Institute takes place at 7 Cambridge Center, in Kendall Square in Cambridge. Come experience science!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Seats in our auditorium for these lectures will be available on a first-come first-served basis, up until the capacity of the room is reached. 
      &lt;strong&gt;Attendees arriving after 6:15pm will be seated at the organizers' discretion, based on the number of available seats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Broad is located in Kendall Square on Main Street.&amp;nbsp; When you exit the Kendall Square Station, walk down Main Street towards Central Square.&amp;nbsp; There is parking in the area, but it is much easier to get there by T.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Information on parking:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After the lecture, there are usually refreshments in the lobby.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some of you may wish to take advantage of this.&amp;nbsp; I would actually prefer to head someplace else for dinner after the lecture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I will go outside the Broad, but still under the roof after the lecture ends and&amp;nbsp;wait for anyone else who may be interested in talking about the lecture a bit and also to get a head count of those who are interested in going to an after event dinner.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We will head out by 7:30.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lecture Details:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Wed, July 27th, 6-7pm: Gut microbes: Frenemies and BFFs in inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/strong&gt;
       &lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/wendy-garrett/" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy Garrett&lt;/a&gt;, M.D. Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;
       &lt;br /&gt;
       &lt;br /&gt;The digestive tract is home to a vast community of bacteria, many of which help to keep us healthy. In some people, the interactions between their own gut bacteria and their immune system are not always peaceful. Their immune systems' reactions to bacteria in the digestive tract result in chronic inflammation and lead to inflammatory bowel disease. Wendy Garrett will discuss inflammatory bowel disease, gut microbial communities, and current scientific efforts to understand the role of gut bacteria in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Midsummer Nights&amp;rsquo; Science will recount the scientific transformation that began more than a century ago with the seminal studies by the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel &amp;mdash; the &amp;ldquo;father of genetics&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; who observed the ways in which physical traits were passed from one pea plant to another. In honor of the scientific field it helped to launch, the pea plant provides the inspiration for the seminar series, which takes its name from one of William Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s well-known plays.&lt;/p&gt;
