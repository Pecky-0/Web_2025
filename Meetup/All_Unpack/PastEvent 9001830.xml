It was actually a good thing we didn't make it to the top; too muggy and the storms rolled in just as we returned to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll bring the detailed directions Al emailed me so we can stay on the trail this time and get to the summit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;First, don't take the trail that's right next to the parking lot. It's a 40 degree incline the whole way up. It was insane. Park in the lot,then walk along the dirt road around the lake. You'll see a sign for the &lt;b&gt;nature trail&lt;/b&gt;. Take that up the mountain until you see a &lt;b&gt;sign for the summit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be about 10 maybe 15 minutes, then you'll see a sign for &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;Walker&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; take that trail for the scenic view if you'd like. Or continue up to the summit. At the summit there are a lot of towers, and some broken glass right at the top. Be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll come out on a tar road, take a left on the road, &lt;br /&gt;then a right on the first dirt road, &lt;br /&gt;you'll see a little trail on your left that leads to the top, which you &lt;br /&gt;should be able to see from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it was easier than the North peak trail, unless you take the incline.&lt;br /&gt;Bring bug spray, I got eaten alive, and water for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun, Bella and I certainly did.&lt;br /&gt;-AL&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these statistics about the South Mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking (one way, up to the summit):&lt;br /&gt;Distance: 0.6 mile &lt;br /&gt;Vertical: 650 feet &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhmountainhiking.com/hike/uncanoonucs/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;More Directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for green Volvo with EPRINT plates nearest parking to the lake</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4894798</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225117938000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224589310000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Uncanoonuc South &amp; the lake - Goffstown, NH</name><id>9001830</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224945000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/9001830/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/global_5970128.jpeg</photo_url></item>
