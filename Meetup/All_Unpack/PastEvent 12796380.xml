The Moat Mountain Trail crosses Lucy Brook at 1.4 miles and can be difficult to cross at high water. The trail then passes the Attitash Trail at 2.4 mi. and at 2.8 mi. begins to pass over numerous ledgy areas with outstanding views before reaching the bare summit of North Moat at 4.3 mi. From there the trail descends sharply to the base of the cone, then gradually with occasional views and some scrambling. At 5.4 mi. the trail joins the Red Ridge Trail with occasional steep descents and good views, rejoining the Moat Mountain Trail at 3.6 mi, then 1.2 mi. back to the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start at 550 feet&lt;br /&gt;North Moat elev. 3196 feet&lt;br /&gt;Elev. gain-2646 feet&lt;br /&gt;Total miles-10.2&lt;br /&gt;Book time-8 hrs. 15 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be spring by the calendar but be prepared for winter conditions.
