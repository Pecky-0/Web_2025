It even has an arcade museum there if your inner (or outer) geek wants the backstory on how these quarter-chompers came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come one, come all. Please post in the comment if you need a ride, or are willing to give one. I am not responsible for getting you there, just letting you know about it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have some fun people. Quarters are not just for laundry and parking meters you know.  (Yeah, yeah.. they are probably using tokens at this point, but you get the idea) For more info on the venue, use this link: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is bowling and other fun things if you are not the arcade type, and a rope course just down the street.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Becki</member_name><member_id>4147212</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344267748000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boardgames-434</urlname><id>521103</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Beantown Gamers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342622816000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Road trip:  Arcade Fun in Laconia</name><id>73860962</id><headcount>15</headcount><duration>27900000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344178800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boardgames-434/events/73860962/</event_url></item>
