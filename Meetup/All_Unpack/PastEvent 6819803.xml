Starbucks is directly in the center. Parking is plentiful and free. It's 55 minutes to get there, less coming home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER: This trip is a ritual of mine. And Newburyport at Christmastime is as beautiful as it gets, particularly at night. Afterwards, optional to each, at 7:30 or 8:00, we walk around the corner to the excellent The Grog and enjoy a meal literally on top of a live blues band that plays below. The music is as good as it gets (they play light classic rock as well), the food excellent and at prices to fit every budget (from $3.50 for seafood chowder to $20), dress casual, not at all crowded, and ambience quaint New England and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEDIA: Unless you are accustomed to painting indoors in crowded conditions, it is recommended you stick to dry and/or simple media. Oils are not recommended because of their residue and fumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald &lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627 &lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542686000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196278754000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>PAINTING AND THE BLUES: Newburyport, MA</name><id>6819803</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196636400000</time><rsvp_limit>4</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/6819803/</event_url></item>
