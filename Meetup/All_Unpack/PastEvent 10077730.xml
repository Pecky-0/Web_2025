Tickets are $30, and I am planning on ordering for the group so that we can all sit together.  So if you RSVP, just plan on bringing $30 to reimburse me.  I am setting the RSVP date for this friday, so I can order tickets in time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here is the press release for the reading:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UMASS Performing Arts Center is pleased to present best-selling author and cutting-edge humorist David Sedaris, back by popular demand to read from his newest work &lt;i&gt;When You Are Engulfed in Flames&lt;/i&gt; on Sunday, April 5, at 8:30 pm. With sardonic wit and incisive social critiques, Sedaris has become one of America’s pre-eminent humor writers. The great skill with which he slices through cultural euphemisms and political correctness proves that he is a master of satire and one of the most observant writers addressing the human condition today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most writers, David Sedaris came to public prominence reading his work aloud. In 1992, his self admittedly high-pitched nasal whine brought NPR listeners “SantaLand Diaries,” his droll tale about working as an elf in New York City’s Macy’s. NPR’s Morning Edition subsequently received more mail about that essay than any piece it had ever aired. Offers from film and television came pouring in, but Sedaris continued to work cleaning apartments in New York by day and writing, as he still does, by night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“How had 9,125 relatively uneventful days passed so quickly and how can I keep it from happening again?” writes Sedaris, whose “punk rock attitude toward death” takes the turn of a man approaching the half century mark in his newest work When You Are Engulfed in Flames. The New York Times writes, “As usual, Sedaris has lots of answers to the first question but not many to the second in this delightful compilation of essays circling the theme of death and dying, with nods to the French countryside, art collecting and feces…There are sidesplitting essays here…The main stage is occupied by a mix of highly pixilated memories, chance meetings with freaks and scenes of Sedaris fretting over his eventual demise.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can't wait to see you there!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Assistant Organizer,&lt;br /&gt;Meg&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be standing next to the ticket window, holding a sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meagan</member_name><member_id>6521348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240958863000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238498123000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April Social Meetup - See David Sedaris Live at UMASS April 5</name><id>10077730</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238976000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/10077730/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/5/global_7923797.jpeg</photo_url></item>
