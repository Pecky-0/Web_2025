Couldn't let this one go by without a meetup!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets meet up at the escalators near the front doors at 7:15.  Showtime is at 7:45, but please be prompt.  It is likely to be very popular and we want to get seats.  Also tickets are already available on Fandango.  I strongly suggest that you get yours early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &amp;quot;Spider-Man 3,&amp;quot; based on the legendary Marvel Comics series, Peter Parker has finally managed to strike a balance between his devotion to M.J. and his duties as a superhero. But there is a storm brewing on the horizon. When his suit suddenly changes, turning jet-black and enhancing his powers, it transforms Peter as well, bringing out the dark, vengeful side of his personality that he is struggling to control. Under the influence of the suit, Peter becomes overconfident and starts to neglect the people who care about him most. Forced to choose between the seductive power of the new suit and the compassionate hero he used to be, Peter must overcome his personal demons as two of the most-feared villains yet, Sandman and Venom, gather unparalleled power and a thirst for retribution to threaten Peter and everyone he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://spiderman3.sonypictures.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://spiderman3.son...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1178579891000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1176049278000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spiderman 3</name><id>5649652</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178406900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5649652/</event_url></item>
