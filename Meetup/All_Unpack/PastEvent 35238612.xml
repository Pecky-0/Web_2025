 &lt;br /&gt;

 These single-day bootcamps are the the important first steps to prepare our movement for election success. The top graduates from these events will go on to work full-time and volunteer for the liberty candidates of their choice. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Attendance is a must if you are serious about winning elections and getting involved locally. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 To help recruit local tea party, liberty, and conservative activists, 5 of the largest grassroots organizations in the country &amp;ndash; Campaign for Liberty, American Majority, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, and the Leadership Institute &amp;ndash; have joined YAL to co-sponsor all 10 events. Combined, their membership consists of over 2.2 million activists nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
