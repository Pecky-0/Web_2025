Campanale's was one of the top vote-getters in one of our Polls in 2009.  Our December 2008 &amp;quot;Brunch Between the Holidays&amp;quot; was so successful that we put up a Poll and the resounding votes told us you wanted another holiday event, and one shortly after the New Year would be best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Campanale's is located in South Braintree square, diagonally across from both the Shaw's Plaza as well as Cafe Asiana, where we have dined in the past.  The restaurant has a vast menu which you can view on their website, as well as the ability to handle a large party which could potentially rival our 3rd Anniversary Dinner this past August.  We will be seated at several tables in the same area, depending on the number of RSVPs.  Revel in the new year and join your SSDOMG friends as we celebrate Meetup, holidays, friendship, food and fun! One more thing - as our holiday gift to you, we are NOT charging our usual $2.00 event fee! You pay only for what you order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SSDOMG Holiday Dinner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, January 7th, 2010 @ 6:30pm&lt;br /&gt;Campanale's Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;88 Pearl Street&lt;br /&gt;Braintree, MA 02184&lt;br /&gt;781-843-6966&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.campanales.net/" target="_blank"&gt;www.campanales.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Organizers:&lt;/b&gt; Angela &amp;amp; Mike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Fee:&lt;/b&gt; None! Happy Holidays from your Organizer Team! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Min/Max:&lt;/b&gt;  None right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Welcome!  One Guest per Member.  For exceptions please contact one of the Event Organizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/b&gt; This is handicap-accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, January 6th @ 7pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash Only Policy:&lt;/b&gt; Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over three years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inclement Weather:&lt;/b&gt; We will only cancel if there is a snowstorm the day of the event.  TBD - Please see our Weather policy on the About page (scroll to the bottom and click on &amp;quot;weather&amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions (Credit to Campanale's &lt;a href="http://www.campanales.net/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overview:&lt;/b&gt; Located in South Braintree Square diagonally across from the Shaw's Plaza and Cafe Asiana.
