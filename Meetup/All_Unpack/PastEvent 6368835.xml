There are many trails I have yet to explore and a dirt road that will lead us past a beaver pond to a working damn. A lovely walk but a bit buggy so bring along some bug spray!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:From Rt.8N take exit 45 (Kennedy Drive). Take a left off the exit.Left at the end of Kennedy Drive onto Winstead Rd. Follow to Junction with Main street and Newfield rd..Take a right onto Newfield road. Continue straight to park entrance about 2-3 miles on the left. VERY easy to over look the sign!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two legged friends are also welcome to join us!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190646602000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189948958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dog Walk-Sunny Brook Park Torrington Ct.</name><id>6368835</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190473200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/6368835/</event_url></item>
