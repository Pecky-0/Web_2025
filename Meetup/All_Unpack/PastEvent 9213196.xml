In this December we plan to have only one meeting due to the holidays. The plan for Kant's ethics is the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Critique of Judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that, as we did in the past once in a while, we venture out to new venues for the sake of change and in the hope of finding even a more appropriate establishment for our discussions. These venues may not be able to seat us, or because of some other unforeseen circumstances we may decide on the spot to move back to the Bombay Club. If you do not find us in the UNO-s by 7:15 then we have just done that.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the philosophy group from the staff.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231462500000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1227380585000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hume: An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals</name><id>9213196</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228435200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/9213196/</event_url></item>
