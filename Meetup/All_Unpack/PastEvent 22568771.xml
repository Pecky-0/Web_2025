I have been sidetracked with a &amp;quot;real job&amp;quot; in the energy field but need to re-engage with RE Investing. So before we all disappear and while the terrible economy continues to generate opportunity for us with great deals - WHERE ARE THEY? Personally I should have access to some ST money for REO's (as a wholesaler) but have been stalled at the best way to search for them. Anyone out there who can help? RE Agents looking to connect with investors and willing to put in 50-60% offers and lots of them to snap a few gems?? Who's with me?&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1309273898000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1308330667000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn how and where to find REOs and other GREAT deals?</name><id>22568771</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1309215600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/22568771/</event_url></item>
