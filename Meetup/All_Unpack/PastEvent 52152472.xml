Trekking poles are strongly suggested. Description: Mt. Chocorua is one of the most beautiful mountains in New Hampshire. At 3500', Chocorua isn't a big peak, but enjoys a bare rocky peak with spectacular 360 degree views and is one of the most popular peaks in the White Mountains. The trail up is mostly in the woods and sheltered; but when you emerge onto the rocky summit, the views are great! We will be hiking this mountain from the north side (Kancamagus Highway). Roundtrip is about 7.6 miles and estimated time to hike will be 8 hours, and has 2250' of elevation gain. Due to this being a winter hike, I am rating it an advanced hike. There is also a side trail loop on the way up at around 1.5 miles that provides a nice side trip to Champney Falls and Pitcher Falls. We will follow the left fork to the falls, and then we will regain the main trail in about 0.4 miles. From the parking lot, we will follow Champney Falls Trail which ascends the northern flank of Mt. Chocorua. We will pass over Twin Brook on a footbridge. At 0.1 mile going straight to remain on Champney Falls Trail (Bolles Trail veers off to the right). At about 0.4 mile, Champney Brook will appear on our left and will run roughly parallel to the trail for the next 1.4 miles. At 1.4 miles Champney Falls Trail forks. The trail rejoins 0.3 mile later (following the right fork) or 0.4 mile later (following the left fork). We'll follow the left fork which will take us past Pitcher Falls and Champney Falls. Pitcher Falls is a narrow stream of water spilling over the side of a narrow gorge. Champney Falls is a series of cascades tumbling down 200 feet. This section of trail tends to be slippery in all seasons. This may be where your traction device we'll be put to use. At 2.4 miles there is a good outlook to the north, just before the switchbacks and steeper climbing begin. At 3.1 miles, we'll turn left to follow the Champney Falls Cutoff (Champney Falls Trail continues straight). After 0.3 mile on Champney Falls Cutoff, that trail ends as it meets up with Middle Sister Trail. We'll turn left and follow Middle Sister Trail to the summit of Middle Sister in 0.1 mile, and then from there continue to the summit of Chocorua. Return via the same route.
