Iron Chef standards...You can find the rules under more/files on the meetup site &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Judges: After Eleven and Queen Obvious  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a combination of charcoal and gas grills available; right now we are at 7 but if you'd like to donate a grill to the cause let me know.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should you grill? Anything you want! (legal consumables only please)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know a few of our favorite grill buddies might be fasting that day but just come late and join in at the level you feel comfortable! There aren't any rules about cooking!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the standard stuff applies - cook onsite, bring what you want to drink and some to share, there are no rules, expect to have a fabulous time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus extra prize (there will be prizes, this is a bonus one) I will give an award for the best &amp;quot;grilling outfit&amp;quot; as voted on by the attendees.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286405744000</updated><rating><average>4.92999982834</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281882716000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Great Big Over-the-Top First Annual Summertime Grill-Off Invitational</name><id>14427555</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284843600000</time><rsvp_limit>36</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/14427555/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/b/8/global_17193768.jpeg</photo_url></item>
