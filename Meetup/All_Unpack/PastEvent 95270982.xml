The intent of this outing is to walk at a moderate pace, enjoy the views, and chat with each other along the way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about this trail is that it is paved and failry level. We can easily adjust the mileage by turning back at the markers along the way. The more ambitious walkers are welcome to go the full 3.5 miles to the end and then catch up with the rest of us on their way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After we finish, let's go to the general store at the corner for lunch or a snack. They make great homemade soups, chill, sandwiches and salads ...&lt;/span&gt; Yummm! They do not take credit cards, so remember to bring cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is cross-posted to other meetups, so please RSVP "YES" on one site only, so that we avoid duplications. No need to RSVP "No" if you cannot attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please dress in layers and bring plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pets are welcome as long as they are leashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone that participates does so at their own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
