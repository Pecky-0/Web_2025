It was shot documentary-style, and is a definite departure from traditional movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film focuses on François, a tough but fair teacher who works in one of France's toughest schools.  François' honest demeanor in the classroom made him a great success with the students in prior years. But this year, things are different.  And when the students begin to challenge his methods, François will find his classroom ethics put to the ultimate test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7:30 - we will meet at 7:15 in the lobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie we will head down the street to Watch City Brewery for food, drinks and conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that each person will be responsible to purchase their own ticket and provide the usual $1 meetup fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241912126000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240258424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Class</name><id>10228033</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240528500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/10228033/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/5/2/global_8261714.jpeg</photo_url></item>
