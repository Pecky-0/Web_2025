We know that some of us singles won't be spending Thanksgiving with family, so we'd like to invite some of you to a singles Thanksgiving dinner (buffet-style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've decided to have a potluck Thanksgiving Dinner at Debbie's house in Kingston, NH, a walk after dinner, and maybe play some board games.  Debbie's house is right on Powwow Pond, and there is a kayak available if anyone wants to go out on the pond.  We will cook the turkey and provide plates, cups, flatware, napkins, etc.  We ask that you bring a prepared dish such as stuffing, vegetables, cranberry sauce, bread, dessert.  Please specify what you'd like to bring so we can coordinate the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dinner and a short walk, we can socialize around the outdoor fireplace (chiminea) and toast marshmallows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also post this event on Social Fun, so get your RSVP in early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address, directions, and Debbie's cell # will be sent the day before Thanksgiving to those who RSVP Yes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291059150000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290174617000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thanksgiving Potluck Dinner</name><id>15498984</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290708000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15498984/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/a/global_19734858.jpeg</photo_url></item>
