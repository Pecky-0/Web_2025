Here are the details of the March meeting of the Greater Boston NLP group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month’s topic: Transforming Limiting Beliefs with NLP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry Ford once said &amp;quot;Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't, you're right&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beliefs lie at the core of how we perceive, filter, and make sense of the world around us. They can limit what we can achieve, or they can provide the “internal scaffolding” for us to achieve extraordinary successes in life. Changing a single limiting belief can have a profound effect on your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month, you will learn and practice NLP techniques for changing beliefs. These are techniques which you can use individually, to change your own limiting beliefs, or with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to this meetup, from beginners to experts. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the group in general or this meeting in particular. I will stay for a while after the meetup, if you want to discuss specific issues that were not addressed during the session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Marx&lt;br /&gt;NLP Master Practitioner&lt;br /&gt;New Light NLP&lt;br /&gt;317 N Main St, Natick MA 01760&lt;br /&gt;(617) 329-1657&lt;br /&gt;adam@NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;www.NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Helping you to become the you that you want to be:&lt;br /&gt;Coaching, Counseling, and Training&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go straight back to the large studio (after 7pm)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269127654000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266582778000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston NLP March Meetup - Transforming Limiting Beliefs with NLP</name><id>dlfdnynfbxb</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268954100000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/12646537/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/d/0/global_11885328.jpeg</photo_url></item>
