It was a cool way to see the city. It was also a social run so it was a lot of fun and a good way to get to know other people who enjoy running. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, you're getting in a good workout while taking in the city's beautiful urbanscapes. Afterward, we might hit a local or go home and shower and head out again later for dinner or drinks... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of several places that would be great for group/social runs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Along the beaches and Castle Island in South Boston.&lt;br /&gt;-Along the Charles (Boston and Cambridge)  &lt;br /&gt;-JP Reservoir &lt;br /&gt;-The Arnold Arboretum in JP&lt;br /&gt;-Through the Parks (The Common, Boston Gardens, The Commonwealth Mall and The Fens) &lt;br /&gt;-Minuteman Bike Path&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242592795000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241235658000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Five Mile Fridays...
