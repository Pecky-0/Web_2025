I hope those of you who have already RSVP'd 'yes' are still able to make it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you are all keeping warm!  I'm tentatively scheduling this meetup while looking for an indoor location that can accomodate us.  I've including a couple of questions with this meeting invite - please be sure to answer them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm looking forward to this next meetup because I'll be introducing a new member.  Pumpkin has a new little sister!  She is a 5 month old maltese whose name is PJ.  She's been with us for a couple of weeks now, and Pumpkin has certainly taken it upon herself to toughen PJ up for playing hard.  And now it's time to introduce PJ to new dogs!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marjie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marjie</member_name><member_id>3703648</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256577428000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Maltese Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-115</urlname><id>215542</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Downtown Boston Maltese Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255615417000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brrr....
