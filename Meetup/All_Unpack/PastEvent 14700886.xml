Do you miss opportunities to connect with new donors, community members and colleagues because you donâ€™t know the best way to approach them at events? Do you have trouble ending conversations so you can keep circulating? We will cover the basics of how to work a room, from having the right tools to knowing the best approach to engage prospective donors and collaborators while cultivating community support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This interactive, fast-paced and fun 90 minute session will be beneficial for seasoned fundraising professionals, non-profit board members, grassroots organizers and anyone interested in creating welcoming community spaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read related blog entries and more&lt;br /&gt;at &lt;a href="http://robbiesamuels.blogspot.com/p/art-of-schmooze.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://robbiesamuels.blogspot.com/p/art-of-schmooze.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://robbiesamuels....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are so LUCKY to have Robbie at thie event.
