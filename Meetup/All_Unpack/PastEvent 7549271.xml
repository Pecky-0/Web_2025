Ask away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have gotten confused about the location of this place so I will tell you that they're situated right below Jordan's Furniture &lt;b&gt;off of&lt;/b&gt; route 9 in Framingham in the same lot as the jewelry store.  If you take either one of the entrances up to Jordans you're fine.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COURTESY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a friendly reminder we would like people to be considerate towards the organizers knowing that some of these events take more time and effort than others by RSVPing accodingly. We know things can change suddenly but a nice one liner email/text/call explaining why you can't make an event or if you're running really late to event you said yes to would be ideal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules for Engagement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow meet up members participating in the event by arriving promptly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVP's are on a first come, first serve basis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do not show up unexpectedly&lt;/b&gt; - if you were not on the YES list do not show up expecting to sit with us &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment requesting to be placed on wait list.
