By popular demand, same time, same location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent Meetups have lasted 2-3 hours, with some folks staying for two games, and some folks leaving after just one. Turnout has ranged from 6-12. Skill and experience has ranged too, from novice players to tournament players. One thing has stayed the same, and that's everyone's fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good resource for new players is the Cross Tables &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.cross-tables.com/download/CHEAT_PRO.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;--a list of two letter and other highly playable words. Look it over if you like, but you don't need to to have fun playing.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Quinten</member_name><member_id>9980941</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256224587000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Word Freaks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston</urlname><id>1385528</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Scrabble Enthusiasts of (Greater) Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254752752000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October mid-month Scrabble meetup!</name><id>11551235</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255881600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scrabble-Enthusiasts-of-Boston/events/11551235/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/e/global_7376798.jpeg</photo_url></item>
