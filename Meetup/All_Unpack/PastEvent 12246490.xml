When Lia Lee Entered the American medical system, diagnosed as an epileptic, her story became a tragic case history of cultural miscommunication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents and doctors both wanted the best for Lia, but their ideas about the causes of her illness and its treatment could hardly have been more different.

Lia's doctors ascribed her seizures to the misfiring of her cerebral neurons; her parents called her illness, qaug dab peg--the spirit catches you and you fall down--and ascribed it to the wandering of her soul. The doctors prescribed anticonvulsants; her parents preferred animal sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annie</member_name><member_id>1543974</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265247981000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paradisecityreaders</urlname><id>1404829</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Paradise City Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262826820000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>February: The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</name><id>12246490</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265068800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paradisecityreaders/events/12246490/</event_url></item>
