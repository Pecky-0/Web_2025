Let's get those bicycles moving!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're planning to do the East Bay bike path this Saturday, the 1st of August, at 11AM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a long ride, but it will *NOT* be a fast one.  &lt;b&gt;This is not a race!&lt;/b&gt;  It will be a fun ride at a comfortable pace.  No need to be nervous if you are not a fast bicyclist.  It's a social ride.  If you want to just do a portion of the ride, feel free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just as much about meeting some nice folks as it is about enjoying some fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;If it is raining â€“ I will reschedule for another day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The East Bay bike path is 14.5 miles of paved bike path from Bristol to Providence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at Colt State Park in Bristol, Rhode Island&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE&lt;/b&gt; remember to take my cell phone number: 401-699-7304 in case you can't find us.  As usual, I will be sporting my signature red road bike.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a red road bike.
