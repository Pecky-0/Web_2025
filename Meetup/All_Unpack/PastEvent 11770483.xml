I may be stamping metals, wrapping ribbon roses, wiring some earrings ... by that time, I hope I'll be finished with the holiday cards and knitting projects. We'll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abeille offers the use of jewelry tools at no charge. You are also welcome to register for the stamping studio ($10) during this time or bring any type of project you may have. There are also sewing machines available but space is limited so no big projects, please. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll have snacks so come join us. We will be there until 5:00pm (maybe 6).&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>lcanale</member_name><member_id>8176022</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260296170000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Crafters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondiycrafts</urlname><id>1301641</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Jewelry Design and DIY Crafts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257178521000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FrEE: Meetup - Wrap up those Holiday Projects</name><id>11770483</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260122400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondiycrafts/events/11770483/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/a/global_7603706.jpeg</photo_url></item>
