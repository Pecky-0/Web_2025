It's the shorter route from the 30-miler we did a few weeks ago. This route will go through &lt;a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/route/us/ma/sharon/138125790163853746" target="_blank"&gt;Foxboro/Sharon/Mansfield&lt;/a&gt; -- those of you who joined us last time will remember the hillS (yes, plural) on Oak Street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the tryptophan kicks in, before you settle in for the day of football and crudites, before the horror of Black Friday and the assault of non-stop-24-hour-looped-Christmas-carols begins...join me for some sanity. It'll make you a better person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and then after the workout we'll head to Waxy's for some beers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - you'll notice the early start...it's getting dark out there early. We should assume the safety of an inside shelter....preferably one that also serves cheese fries.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park in the spots closest to Main Street (furthest from stores).
