His films have often faced state censorship and the wrath of religious fundamentalists. &lt;br /&gt;

 In 1997, a statue of Ambedkar in a Dalit (Untouchable) colony in Mumbai was desecrated. Ambedkar was a central figure in the Dalit liberation movement in India. As angry residents gathered, police opened fire, killing 10. Vilas Ghogre, a leftist poet, hanged himself in protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jai Bhim Comrade, shot over 14 years, follows the poetry and music of a subaltern tradition of reason that has, from the days of the Buddha, fought superstition and religious bigotry with poetry and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their potent mix of revolutionary politics and Dalit liberation ideology, the artists' collective (Kabir Kala Manch) has been subject to intense state repression. Many of the artists featured in the film are now underground to escape arrest. For more info visit www.kabirkalamanch.wordpress.com&lt;/p&gt;
