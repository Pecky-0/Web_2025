If this is the case, is all of philosophy beside the point: a case of the tail wagging the dog?  While I think that there is some truth to this conjecture, basically my view is that despite the difficulty of its project the whole point of doing philosophy is to prevent the tail wagging and to get the dog back in the driver's seat. (I know, I'm doing some really bad metaphor mixing here, but you get my point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nietzsche quote is just a means to help start a lively discussion. This is the inaugural meeting of this meetup group, so in more ways than one it is the opening round of what I hope to be an exciting volley of ideas (bad metaphors aside).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the guy in the picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246053470000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238549668000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Is Philosophy "A Kind of Involuntary and Unconscious Memoir?" -- Nietzsche</name><id>10084041</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243033200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/events/10084041/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/6/global_7925510.jpeg</photo_url></item>
