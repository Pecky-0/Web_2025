But I will not have the time to cook before hand.  I may throw something in the crock pot that morning, but no idea what.&lt;br /&gt;Food (snacks) - If you bring it, it will probably get eaten.&lt;br /&gt;Drinks (non-alcoholic) - Sometimes everyone brings some; sometimes no one does. &amp;quot;You pay your dime you take your chances.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Drinks (alcoholic) - I'm not driving and we'll have plenty of room for those who want to crash, but we're not big drinkers ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;Chairs - We have a decent number of chairs, but if it's not too much trouble you may want to bring one. You can even bring them and leave them if you have any you want to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;Other - Bring anything you like as long as it doesn't get anyone in trouble with the law&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel/Parking:&lt;br /&gt;Parking - I live close to the beginning of the street, so at soon as you make the turn start looking for parking. Most of the parking in the area is resident only.  We have a driveway that can fit 3 tandem so if everyone noses up, so please pull all the way in.&lt;br /&gt;***Parking Update - I do have parking permits for everyone to park on the street&lt;br /&gt;Train - we live 6-8 minute walk from the back exit of Alewife. Just walk away from the main road (the only one you can see from that exit) When you come to a fork in the trail take the middle one. Clay street is a strait shot from there. Turn left at Clay and we are on the left in a brown building.&lt;br /&gt;Bus - nearby is the 350, 77, 79, 83, 87, 88, 89&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me if you have any questions at all.
