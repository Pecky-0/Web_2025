Hopefully, it will be quiet enough so that everyone can talk to each other a little easier than at the Tavern on the Square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're taking the T, the Green Line Haymarket, Orange Line State St, and Blue Line Aquarium stops seem to be nearby. mbta.com is your friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an alternate suggestion for some place that can handle 15-20 people and is quiet and accessable, please speak up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll probably talk about the books, television, movies, comics and games that we like (and those we don't like, and even those we may be ashamed to admit that we like), but there is no set agenda!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll have Meetup signs, but you can always look for the geeky people. :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom "spot" Callaway</member_name><member_id>2590946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251848834000</updated><rating><average>4.90000009537</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248227672000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August Social Meetup</name><id>10928923</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249426800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/10928923/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
