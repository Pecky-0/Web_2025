<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&amp;quot;Fear(s) of the Dark is an animated anthology that tells its stories with an inventiveness thatâ€™s seldom scary but never less than mesmerizing.&amp;quot; -- Jeannette Catsoulis, New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Though multi-director projects are patchy by definition, Fear(s) of the Dark hits with an all-star batting average.&amp;quot; -- Aaron Hills, Village Voice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The picture is best enjoyed as visual spectacle; it never achieves terrifying intensity. &amp;quot; -- Stephen Farber, Hollywood Reporter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;There isn't a dud in the 10 shorts, although some are more dud-ish than others.&amp;quot; --  V.A. Musetto,&lt;br /&gt;New York Post &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailer: &lt;a href="http://ur1.ca/ayv" target="_blank"&gt;http://ur1.ca/ayv...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six graphic artists and cartoonists bring nightmares to life on the big screen. Includes contributions from Blutch, Charles Burns, Marie Caillou, Pierre di Sciullo, Lorenzo Mattotti, Richard McGuire, Romain Slocombe, Jerry Kramsky and Michel Pirus. From what I've read on the Kendall website, the stories are interrelated somehow. Included in the mix will be Japanese schoolgirls, samurai, spiders, at least one hospital scene, hounds on a blood-thirsty rampage and multiple styles of animation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this my contribution toward having more group events at Kendall, it is also the first time in over a year that I'll be hosting an event with animated shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in case your interested, Fear(s) of the Dark has a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a French film and yes, there will be subtitles. It also appears that the animation is done  in black and white (a la Persepolis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film, we'll go to a restaurant for discussion, per our custom.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be holding a meetup sign at the end of the film.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole</member_name><member_id>3185465</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225167134000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fear(s) of the Dark</name><id>9045401</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225570500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9045401/</event_url></item>
