Please RSVP by Dec 1 so we know how many of you are coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no charge. &lt;b&gt;Please BYOB and bring an hors d'oeuvre.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: royalblue"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ice and non-alcoholic beverages will be available. &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;Spouses and kids welcome.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll do our usual Yankee Swap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ultimate gift-giving exchange where re-gifting is not only allowed, it’s encouraged!  To participate in the swap, bring along a wrapped present.  Everyone who brings a gift will go home with one, whether or not you want to! The best gifts for a Yankee Swap are often things you have around the house already but never found a use for - a CD of Ethel Merman’s show tunes, that really tacky scarf form old Aunt Helen, or the mini screwdriver set you thought would be really handy. In a Yankee Swap, anything goes! Creative, tacky &amp;amp; goofy encouraged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve never experienced a Yankee Swap, here are the rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has brought a gift will pick from a hat a number. The person who receives the number 1 will pick a gift (that is not their own) from the pile and open it for all to see. The person who receives number 2 will pick a gift from the pile, open it, and then choose to keep the gift or exchange it with number 1. Gift-picking continues in ascending order, with each person choosing to keep their gift or trade it with the others who have previously picked. After all the gifts have been picked, the person who received number 1 has their choice of all the opened gifts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just c'mon in!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda Bedard</member_name><member_id>5621944</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233931043000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Network Marketers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>networkmarket-792</urlname><id>818489</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4400024414</group_lon><name>Independent Creative Club of Greater Hartford</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225205764000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ICC holiday party</name><id>9046865</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1228429800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/networkmarket-792/events/9046865/</event_url></item>
