Do you want to know more about Plone, Zope, and Python?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and meet other Plone users and developers at the Boston Plone users group. We will gather monthly to talk about how we are using Plone, share knowledge and give demonstrations of cool Plone products. All skill levels are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have specific topics that you'd like to discuss, please post them in the discussion forum. (and yes, we will eventually move this over to a Plone site).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fourth floor at 60 Canal Street right near North Station.
