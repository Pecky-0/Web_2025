Very few people will escape with less than a fifteen percent increase. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to attend our next General Membership meeting on Tuesday evening, November 18 at the Wellesley Free Library, beginning at 7 PM. We will present the Guidelines, calculate your individual support order (if you wish), discuss our response, and begin our action plan for 2009. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you demand change that matters, come to this meeting. Also, BRING A NEW SUPPORTER WITH YOU. A bigger army means a faster victory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free refreshments will be served. The meeting is free and open to the public. We begin at 7 PM and finish around 9 PM, but you can arrive or leave whenever you wish. Directions are found below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Wellesley Free Library, 530 Washington St, Wellesley, MA 02482:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH&lt;br /&gt;Take Route 128, to Exit 20B (Route 9 West).
