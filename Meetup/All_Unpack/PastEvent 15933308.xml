Sounds crazy right? Come hear Aaron White share how Proxlet.com uses Node.js to serve millions of requests to thousands of users each week, while maintaining 99.9% uptime &amp;amp; sub 400ms response times.... for meager $10 a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our February JavaScript Meetup will be held on Thursday 3rd at Microsoft Research Center located at One Memorial Drive in Cambridge. We are confirmed by Microsoft for the 1st floor conference room. There is also parking available at a cheap evening rate in the building. Parking is also free on the street in front of the building at 6 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Microsoft will provide pizza again. What a generous organization!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;Talk begins aprox. 6:45-7:25pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the presentation | demonstration, we will go around the room introducing ourselves and asking the group for advice | opinions on any JavaScript-related issues members are facing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and bring guests. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alistair MacDonald</member_name><member_id>9070213</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300230902000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>JavaScripters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>javascript-2</urlname><id>884541</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>The Boston JavaScript Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>117</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294262794000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Node.js FTW - Aaron White</name><id>15933308</id><headcount>75</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296775800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/javascript-2/events/15933308/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/c/global_19957996.jpeg</photo_url></item>
