If you have emailed me to ask to play in this event and you are not on the list of players, you have been placed on the waitlist and will be contacted if one of the players cancels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday Aug 10 from 7 to 9 PM we will have an advanced level meetup at the Cambridge Recreational Center in Cambridge. This game is intended to be approximately Yankee C level or equivalent. Players are required to know how to play a 6-2 and 5-1 formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INSTRUCTIONS: Because this game requires players to know formations, the RSVP procedure is a little different. If you'd like to play, please do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Send an email to me using the following URL: &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=4774008" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/message/?recipientId=4774008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not played in the advanced games before, in the email, confirm that you know how to play in a 5-1 or 6-2 offense, and mention your preferred positions (if any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Players will be added to the list to fill up positions. Preference is given to Yankee C or above players (or equivalent), and people who have not been no-shows at previous meetups. There is a strict cap at 12 players to make sure everyone gets lots of playing time. Note that sending an email does not guarantee a spot to play; spots are only guaranteed if you are assigned a Yes RSVP. The cost of the meetup will be $5. Please pay the organizer when you arrive before the meetup starts. The money goes to cover the cost of the court rental. The entrance to the gym is on Cambridge Street opposite Harvard Market. The nearest intersection to the entrance is Cambridge Street and Roberts Road. The nearest T stop is Harvard Square. The gym is about a ten minute walk from the T stop. You can park near the gym at the meters which generally are free to park at after 6 PM (check the parking signs to be sure).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brian Lee</member_name><member_id>4774008</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1313068637000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1312426945000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Advanced Indoor Volleyball</name><id>28204681</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313017200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/28204681/</event_url></item>
