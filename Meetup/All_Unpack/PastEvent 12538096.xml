It is sponsored by the Year of India, the Cogut Center for the Humanities and the Watson Institute for International Studies, the university said in a news release. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Indian-born British writer was named one of the world’s top 100 public intellectuals by Foreign Policy magazine in 2005. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to literature in 2007. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Rushdie is among the most impressive commitments of literary intelligence to Indian materials,” Ashutosh Varshney, professor of political science at Brown, said in the news release. Varshney co-edited the 2009 essay collection “Midnight’s Diaspora: Encounters with Salman Rushdie.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rushdie’s 1988 novel, “The Satanic Verses,” was highly controversial and was banned in several Islamic countries for what was perceived as a blasphemous depiction of Mohammed. The book prompted Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against Rushdie, who subsequently spent several years in hiding.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>sellingsanctuary</member_name><member_id>3325851</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266532090000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265491762000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salman Rushdie-Public Events, Private Lives: Literature and Politics/Modern Wld</name><id>12538096</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266358500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/12538096/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
