&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;This week's location is: 3 Gringos Cantina on Broadway on the West Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;You've driven by it. You've been at the intersection of Broadway and Dean street heading West waiting for the light to change, looked across the street to the left, seen it on the opposite side and wondered, hmmmm I wonder what that place is like.......? Well, we have it on good authority by one who is always in search of a new place that THIS place has friendly staff, good food and even a decent selection on beer! Do we really need any other excuse, other than - we haven't been there yet - ever!?&amp;nbsp; 3 Gringos Cantina is closer to the downtown Providence side of Broadway (but just over 95, and near Broadway Bistro where we went to last Fall. So, if you've been wondering while waiting for the light, here's your chance and let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.   &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a silver scarf, but we're very friendly and hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
