Yet unlike most thieves, who steal for  profit, Gilkey steals for love - the love of books. Perhaps equally  obsessive, though, is Ken Sanders, the self-appointed "bibliodick"  driven to catch him. Sanders, a lifelong rare book collector and dealer  turned amateur detective, will stop at nothing to catch the thief  plaguing his trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In following both of these eccentric characters,  journalist Allison Hoover Bartlett plunged deep into a world of  fanatical book lust, and ultimately found herself caught between the  many people interested in finding Gilkey's stolen treasure, and the man  who wanted to keep it hidden: the thief himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a mixture of  suspense, insight, and humor, Bartlett has woven this cat-and-mouse  chase into a narrative that not only reveals exactly how Gilkey pulled  off his crimes and how Sanders eventually caught him, but also explores  the romance of books, the lure to collect them, and the temptation to  steal them. All collectors have stories of what first made them fall in  love, and Gilkey and Sanders are no different. Bartlett puts their  stories into the larger context of book passion, collection, and theft  through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Community Room, downstairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annie</member_name><member_id>1543974</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323134041000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paradisecityreaders</urlname><id>1404829</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Paradise City Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302626553000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December: The Man Who Loved Books Too Much, Allison Hoover Bartlett</name><id>17277790</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323129600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paradisecityreaders/events/17277790/</event_url></item>
