This group hasn't been very active, and I want to try and change that. It all starts with people getting to know one another. So please RSVP if you are interested, and suggest a venue and/or day.   Looking forward to meeting you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**We have a reservation for 7pm, so when you get there tell the host you are with the surfing meetup group&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>11388242</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303571043000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><why>This group hasn't been very active in the past, and I want to try and change that.</why><group><who>Surfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>surfing-69</urlname><id>737305</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Surfing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297438464000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>social hour / cocktails</name><id>16529207</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1302303600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/surfing-69/events/16529207/</event_url></item>
