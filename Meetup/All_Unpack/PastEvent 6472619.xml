There is a great review on the Courant's website at &lt;a href="http://www.ctnow.com/..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ctnow.com/...&lt;/a&gt;. Meet for dinner first and then enjoy the entertainment. They have a happy hour from 4:30-7pm so feel free to drop by earlier.  Not sure if I can get there by 4:30pm but I hope to arrive before 7pm.  I went here a few weeks ago and had a blast!&lt;br /&gt;NickiJ has offered to organize this one since my son is not feeling well.  I may be able to make it but I'm not sure right now.  Nicki will be there at about 6pm to hang out a little early if anyone wants to join her.  She has offered her cell phone in case anyone needs it...860-307-1550.  Thanks, Nicki!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. On their website, it states that there is a $3 cover charge.  When I went, they did not charge us but just be prepared that they might.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1191798456000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191352958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and Karaoke at Butterfly </name><id>6472619</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1191625200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/6472619/</event_url></item>
