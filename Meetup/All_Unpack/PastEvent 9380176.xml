I have secured a room on the second floor of the First Parish Church for meetings every Monday from 6pm - 8pm. We can talk more about how this will work as we get started, but I thought we'd start with an intro to meditation (for newbies or those looking for a refresher) from 6:00 to 6:30pm, a group sitting from 6:30 to 7:00pm, then discussion time from 7:00 to 8:00pm. Just enter the door to the right of the main entrance, and go up the stair to the left. The room is at the top of the stairs. The fee will only be a few dollars to cover the cost of the room and  the online fees for running the meetup group. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My intention is to offer this group space to anyone interested in creating a community around the development of awareness and peace of mind. There is no particular philosphy, religion, or technique that I intend to adhere to, so come with your own beliefs, practices and philosophies to join us for a gathering of like-minded people. And bring your favorite books, poems, or passages that might offer fodder for discussion. Feel free to spread the word, it is not necessary to be a meetup.com member to attend, and this is open to the public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Cannon, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be greeting people as they arrive.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231801048000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230047818000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Mindfulness Meetup</name><id>9380176</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231196400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/9380176/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
