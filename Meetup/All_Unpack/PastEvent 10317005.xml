(art, history, and architecture).  I have gone many times and it's always fun.  The theme for this evening, May 14, is NB Seen.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the AHA! website: &lt;a href="http://www.ahanewbedford.org/calendar.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ahanewbedf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past we have all met at the visitor center at 6 and then gone on from there as one large group.  However, I am giving a final until 6 and so we're going to change things up a bit.  Where you can meet us:&lt;br /&gt;1) At 6pm Charlie will meet people at the visitor center.  He will depart with anyone who is there by 6:15.&lt;br /&gt;2) At 7pm I will be at the Zeiterion theater for the UMass Dartmouth and Kekeli African Dance and Drumming Ensemble.  Their performance is 7:15-8:15.&lt;br /&gt;3) At 8:30 we will head over to Freestone's for dinner.  I believe they have music starting at 9 or so, which will also be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please indicate in your RSVP where you will join the group (visitor center, Zeiterion, Freestone's).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can park for free on the street after 6, or if you decide to come much earlier just bring a couple quarters for the meters.  I'll send out my cell number and Charlie's number the day before to Yes responders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come out for a night of free entertainment!  Hope to see you there.  This is a joint event with The South Shore 30+ Singles Meetup and WINGS.  Please RSVP on just one site.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Charlie will meet people at the visitor center; I will catch up after my final</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlie L</member_name><member_id>4435771</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243037096000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241236279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AHA! night in New Bedford</name><id>10317005</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242338400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/10317005/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
