I asked for seats near the water which could not be sure to get granted but they would do there best to make the area close to a water view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the list of entree's appts, and dessert all included for 19.95, the place is beautiful and classy. Looking forward to meeting all who will attend and getting ideas and suggestions of what things we can do to make this site fun for all. Please bring suggestions  with you on peice of paper and we can discuss the ideas as we pull them out  to discuss. No one will know who suggested the event or idea unless you want it to be recognized as your own idea and would like to be the host of the event. I would like to make this site a group effort and looking to eveyone to have it all happen. Big things do happen in numbers. &lt;br /&gt;This will be our first meetup of the year and I am hoping that all who answered yes to coming will be good enough to show up. If you cannot make this event please RSVP by the 12th so i can change the number of attendees at the Waterman Grille. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar items will also be at your own expense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i know a big football game will be underway, but im sure we can get the score and who knows a occasional view what the happening at the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entrée&lt;br /&gt;Waterman Steak; Hereford top sirloin,&lt;br /&gt;chedder, bacon, scallion mashed, crispy&lt;br /&gt;onion strings, red chile-bourbon aïoli&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murray’s Statler Chicken Breast;&lt;br /&gt;white bean, tomato, fennel ragout;&lt;br /&gt;escarole, grilled bread&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cod Aqua Pazzo; mussels, cherry tomato,&lt;br /&gt;chourico, Israeli cous cous; grilled fennel,&lt;br /&gt;toasted crostini&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cedar-Planked Salmon; wood roasted&lt;br /&gt;salmon, root vegetable hash; sautéed&lt;br /&gt;spinach, coriander spiced crème fraîche&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Course&lt;br /&gt;Squash Soup&lt;br /&gt;chive sour cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterman Salad&lt;br /&gt;baby greens, grape tomato,&lt;br /&gt;English cucumber, red onion,&lt;br /&gt;gorgonzola, crostini, roasted&lt;br /&gt;garlic-balsamic vinaigrette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Szechuan Beef Skewers&lt;br /&gt;wood-grilled beef skewers,&lt;br /&gt;fiery peanut dip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dessert&lt;br /&gt;Chocolate Mousse Torte&lt;br /&gt;raspberry coulis, whipped cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crème Brûlée&lt;br /&gt;caramelized sugar top,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fresh mint&lt;br /&gt;Seasonal Fruit Sorbet&lt;br /&gt;or Ice Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Claire</member_name><member_id>4222330</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295290521000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Exciting People Having Some Fun!</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mingle-with-singles</urlname><id>1452082</id><group_lat>41.9099998474</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Mingle with singles 45+ Socializing and dancing</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291222947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner out  Waterman Grille</name><id>15608809</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295214300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mingle-with-singles/events/15608809/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/0/global_10652416.jpeg</photo_url></item>
