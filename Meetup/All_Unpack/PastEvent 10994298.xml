The Humane Society of the United States invites you to attend a free Lobbying for Animals seminar where you can learn how to make a tremendous difference for animals in Maine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our presentation covers everything you need to be a citizen advocate for animals. We'll show you basic, but effective, lobby techniques. You'll learn how a bill becomes a law, what influences a legislator and what animal-related bills and issues we expect to be considered by the state legislature in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attend this free seminar and gather all the tools and techniques you need to be a successful citizen lobbyist. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256166940000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248973391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lobby 101 for Animals in Ellsworth</name><id>10994298</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254348900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/10994298/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/b/global_9047547.jpeg</photo_url></item>
