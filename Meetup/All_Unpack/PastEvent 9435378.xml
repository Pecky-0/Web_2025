Bring your sweetie, bring a friend, or just bring yourself!  We'll be heading down the Route 24 corridor for this event.  This restaurant was recommended by a Group Member.  (Find out who on the &amp;quot;Restaurant Suggestions and Recommmendations - 2008&amp;quot; Discussion Thread (DT) on the Message Board (MB).)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to their website, they offer &amp;quot;Rustic Regional Italian Food in a Casual Setting.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;LaStoria Trattoria is not your usual 'Red Sauce' Italian Restaurant.  We are a regional Italian Restaurant, specializing in dishes from Sicily to Napoli, Rome to Calabria, and Firenze to Venice.  We use authentic recipes from the old country.  All dishes are cooked 'To order' in the Italian tradition using only the freshest Produce, Fish, and Meats.  We out source imported Olive oils, Truffle oil, Balsamic Vinegar and other various Italian Pantry items.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The menu is expansive, the location is in a town we haven't been to yet, and it's a great way to get out and socialize with others just before the 'infamous' Valentine's 'holiday.'  This could be a great way to make plans for Valentine's Day if you are looking for something non-Valentine's-Day to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LaStoria&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;577 Washington Street (Route 138)&lt;br /&gt;Stoughton, MA 02072&lt;br /&gt;781 341-9797&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, February 12th @ 6:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lastoriatrattoria.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.lastoriatrattoria.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizer(s):&lt;/b&gt; Angela &amp;amp; Mike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Min/Max:&lt;/b&gt; Minimum of 6 people by 4pm on Tues. Feb. 10th.  Max of 14 attendees. (Changed from 20 to 14 on Tues 2/10 due to the number of RSVPs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; One per member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Fee:&lt;/b&gt; Org Team and Annual Members - Free, Members and Guests - $2pp &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price Range:&lt;/b&gt; Appetizers, Soups and Salads range from $2.50 to $19, with entrees ranging from $16 to $24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash Only Policy:&lt;/b&gt; Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over two years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps us to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; Extended from Wednesday, February 11th @ 4pm to Thursday, February 12th @ 10am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; LaStoria is located on Central St (Route 138) in Stoughton. The least complicated route is probably to take Route 128 North to Exit 2A (Route 138 South). Follow Route 138 through Canton, into Stoughton, then watch for LaStoria on your right directly across from Midas.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Our reservation is under Angela.
