We've decided to have a last minute bonfire party at my house in Durham, NH.  So if you're looking for something to do tonight, please come join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be outside but have access to the bathroom in the house.  We have a large picnic table there but please bring your chairs and sit around the bonfire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Party starts at 6 pm.  Please do not bring any wood to burn--I have plenty.  This is a BYO (Bring Your Own) party.  We will have some food there, but bring anything you might like to eat or drink. And don't forget to bring a chair if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others are already planning to join us, so this event will take place even if no one RSVP's.  Feel free to make a last minute decision and just show up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be a nice clear, moonlit night--a great night for a bonfire!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My house is actually on &amp;quot;30 Long Pond Road&amp;quot; which is right next to 12 Hampshire Ave.  My road is brand new so it might not appear on someone's GPS or Mapquest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for the tiki torches at the begining of the driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble finding the place, call me at 603- 312-6735.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1293235885000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1293212585000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last minute Christmas Eve Bonfire!</name><id>15814058</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1293231600000</time><rsvp_limit>55</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/15814058/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/1/global_5473521.jpeg</photo_url></item>
