Additionally on the northern outskirts of the Fresh Pond Reservation lies a nursing home called the Neville Center.

In 1852, the Pond became the City's drinking water supply.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet outside the front doors of Wholefoods Market at 10:30 am</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272234071000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272027499000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fresh Pond Cambridge walk from Whole Foods</name><id>13267740</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272060900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/13267740/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/8/1/global_5259713.jpeg</photo_url></item>
