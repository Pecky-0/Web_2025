These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. It’s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CHORUS is an uplifting ans inspiring movie in the rich tradition of MUSIC OF THE HEART and MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS about a masterful teacher who put his heart into his work and changed the lives of his students forever. With a soundtrack of boys' singing, the lovely music of this film is the glue that will stick to viewers long after watching it. &lt;br /&gt;When Clément Mathieu  takes a job teaching music at a school for troubled boys, he is unprepared for its harsh discipline and depressing atmosphere. But with passion and unconventional teaching methods, he's able to spark his students' interest in music and bring them a newfound joy! It also puts him at odds with the school's overbearing headmaster, however, locking Mathieu in a battle between politics and the determination to change his pupils' lives! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the Orange line.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229992488000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226108140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Chorus for December 12th</name><id>9117751</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229128200000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/9117751/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/3/4/global_5806660.jpeg</photo_url></item>
