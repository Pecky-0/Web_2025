Imagine...all six kettles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's fun and exhilarating, but best of all, you get a price break...organize a Brewfest, and the sixth kettle is free!&lt;br /&gt;Remember, brewing six styles ensures variety and a discount. We've had old homebrewing buddies, new found friends, office parties and restaurant staff come together for the fun and the brewing. Think about getting a brewfest together today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to bolstering friendship, building morale, fostering teamwork and enhancing self-esteem (need we go on?), everyone has fun and ends up with a good variety (and a good amount) of beer.You won't believe how many of your friends, acquaintances or co-workers will be excited to participate...but someone has to get the ball rolling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically: six couples can each brew one kind of beer and collectively, we only pay for five of the six kettles! Please let me know if anyone is interested! :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316218846000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288493911000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brewfest!
