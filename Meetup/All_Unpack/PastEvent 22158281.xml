&lt;p&gt;"History becomes alive and fun as the Pirate King (captain) gives commands to the crew to hoist the square sails and brace the yardarms all awhile telling stories as waves are gently lapping against the hull. Sailing along the same waters used for centuries by great sailing ships of an era gone by - Patriots, Privateers and Pirates - Oh My!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sailing experience will include crew dressed as pirates climbing the rigging and setting sail, telling stories about pirates, patriots and privateers along with the history of the harbor and entertaining our guest as much as they would like to be."&lt;/p&gt;
