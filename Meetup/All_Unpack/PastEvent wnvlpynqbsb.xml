It has been a long time since we have chosen a great classic for our monthly literary consumption.  It may deviate, ever so slightly, from our normal Christmas time reads, but what better way to keep a little bit of Halloween going into December.  Here are a few reviews found on BarnesandNoble.Com and I hope to see you all there next month!:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelley's classic hints in part at the possible dangers inherent in the pursuit of pure science; it also portrays the injustice of a society which persecutes outcasts such as the &amp;quot;Monster.&amp;quot; Disturbing and profoundly moving, Frankenstein has become part of our own mythology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the Publisher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Classic Graphic Novel Collection is a revolutionary new series of graphic novels which re-tells classic literature for learners of English. Graded at the intermediate level, the fresh blend of accessible storytelling and captivating artwork ensures that students will want to return to these stories time and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Library Bookwatch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankenstein's new look tailors a play for performance and provides a strong plot suitable for contemporary drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Hynes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . .[T]he novel Frankenstein is quite a read. . . .It's highly Romantic, in the literary sense. . .[there is] a good deal of attractive torment and self-doubt, from both Victor Frankenstein and his creation. . . .If ever a book needed to be placed in context, it's Frankenstein. â€”The New York Times Book Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children's Literature&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children may know of the monster Frankenstein, the giant creature made from the body parts of dead people and brought to life by a mad scientist. But they may not know that this horrible monster wanted more than anything to find his family and friends and receive their love. In this &amp;quot;Stepping Stone Classic,&amp;quot; Mary Shelly's well-loved horror story has been adapted into modern language for beginning readers. The short, illustrated chapters will enchant young people with the tale of Victor Frankenstein, his quest for the secret of life, and the terrible monster that haunted him until his death. Readers will sympathize with and understand Frankenstein's remorse for bringing life from the dead when they learn of the pain and sadness he feels upon discovering that it is his own face that frightens innocent people. As always, this great story is filled with excitement. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask the bartender or hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob Lamothe</member_name><member_id>6364190</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rebecca</member_name><member_id>7202411</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Craig</member_name><member_id>8977543</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292439148000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portsmouth-Book-Club</urlname><id>1147811</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth Book Club Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289360623000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portsmouth Book Club December Meetup - Frankenstein</name><id>wnvlpynqbsb</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292371200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portsmouth-Book-Club/events/15400229/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/2/global_19527426.jpeg</photo_url></item>
