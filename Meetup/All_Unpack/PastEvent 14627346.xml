We eat all our meals at the &lt;i&gt;Sukkah&lt;/i&gt;, a strange hut-like temporary construction of walls without the roof, under the open sky. In fact, for seven days we make this temporary dwelling our home. We refrain from eating or drinking anything outside of the Sukkah, even a glass of water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will learn about, and experience &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Four Kinds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; -- lulav, etrog, hadass and aravah and learn the kabbalistic meaning of the ancient ritual, which evokes the spiritual powers of 'four directions' and quality of the Divine attributes within ourselves. We perform the &lt;i&gt;Four Kinds&lt;/i&gt; ritual and meditations and receive divine blessing of its power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will talk about &lt;i&gt;Water Drawing Celebration&lt;/i&gt; -- the most joyful celebration that took place when the Temple stood in Jerusalem; in all-night celebrations, water was poured on the Altar, processions, dancing, singing and playing musical instruments continued for 6 nights till daybreaks, 'drawing water with joy'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been said that 'one who did not see the joy of the water-drawing celebrations, has not seen joy in his life.' We will talk about and re-enact, meditatively relive these ancient rituals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also continue to learn meditative practice of blessing as a main way of receiving &lt;i&gt;Ruach HaKodesh,&lt;/i&gt; Divine Inspiration: amazing deep meditative practice, whcih is capable of transforming one's life on all levels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Place:&lt;/b&gt; my home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; Friday, September 24, 6:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to bring:&lt;/b&gt; This day is Yom Tov of Sukkot, so no contributions could be carried or used. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to dress:&lt;/b&gt; Any way you feel is appropriate to honor the Presence. Also considering weather: we will have our meals outdoor, dwelling in Sukkah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monetary contributions: Suggested offering is $20. Part of your offering will go to charity. &lt;br /&gt;Please contribute online with paypal should you chose to do so. *No material contribution is required. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP:&lt;/b&gt; Please try to be on time. We gather at 6:00 PM, light candles at 6:22 PM and proceed with Shabbat rituals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to our Sukkot Shabbat together!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Miriam </member_name><member_id>7891623</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285467068000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Kabbalah-and-Meditation</urlname><id>1557684</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>Kabbalah and Meditation</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283393732000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kabbalah at the Shabbat Table: Festival of Sukkot</name><id>14627346</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285365600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Kabbalah-and-Meditation/events/14627346/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/1/1/global_17650113.jpeg</photo_url></item>
