In this class you will learn how to give accurate and healing angel readings, using psychic means and angel oracle cards through skill-building and experiential practice. The curriculum includes giving angel readings during the practicum period and interpreting the angelic messages. You will learn how to interpret the meaning behind the cards and how to present the information given to you by the Angels for helping to heal yourself and others.
