<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Anyone who is into photographing nature has seen the work of Andrew Goldsworthy, amazing time tested arrangements of nature in a most unnatural way yet so appealing and you may think, hey I want to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I thought this would make for a fun meetup. We will meet at the Main Building at 1PM and walk for a bit till we each find an area and the materials to create a scene of our own and then photograph it. Andrews work can take a whole day to prepare, but we will be speeding things up a bit before it starts to cool off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a Google link to his work: &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS254&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=spell&amp;amp;resnum=0&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;q=goldsworthy&amp;amp;spell=1" target="_blank"&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a tripod and a blanket, fingered or fingerless gloves, dress in layers and bring a slicker in case we get a little sprinkle (there's a 30% chance of light rain) also bring containers for collecting leaves or what ever you collect to arrange. got something from your yard or some leaves you want to include? Bring those too! The idea is to be all natural, but if you bring some thread, I won't tell :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also bring a thermos of something hot to drink and some cookies to share, any kind will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never done this before, so I'm looking forward to see how this goes, if it's a hit, I'll do one in the winter for a whole different effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Need to reach me? 617-584-4797 or email, I get both on my iPhone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In front of the Visitor center</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227140740000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandphotographynetwork</urlname><id>353886</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8499984741</group_lon><name>New England Photography Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225156266000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Are you Goldsworthy?</name><id>9044016</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225558800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandphotographynetwork/events/9044016/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/e/global_6069342.jpeg</photo_url></item>
