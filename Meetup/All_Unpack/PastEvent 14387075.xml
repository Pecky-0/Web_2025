So I rescheduled this to Oct 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cross posted event from &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/hiking-490/"&gt;my own hiking meetup group in Vermont.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my hiking friends in MA asked me to set this up when we hiked together in Maine in July and I promised I'll set it up in Sep time frame.  So...here we go:  &lt;br /&gt;As Jay Peak (3858 ft) and Big Jay (3786 ft) are the 2 peaks which are listed on NE HH (New England Hundred Highest), I'd like to peakbag both of them at once.  Jay Peak is on LT(Long Trail) but Big Jay is not.  Therefore, we'll need to find herd path from Jay Peak to Big Jay during our hike.  &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;The picture shows the starting point of herd path(left) from Long Trail.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view from the summit of Jay Peak is superb!  &lt;br /&gt;I hope we can see beautiful foliage in northern Vermont at the time we hike.   &lt;br /&gt;If you're only interested in going to Jay Peak but not Big Jay, you can feel free to skip Big Jay and return to the parking lot from Jay Peak.  But in this case, please take care of yourself for return trip back to Burlington since I'll spend more time for hiking further to reach Big Jay than the hike you do.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Hiking Plan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This is round trip hike which doesn't require car spot.  &lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the trailhead of Long Trail parking lot on Rt 242 at Jay Pass at 9AM.  &lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;2) We'll start hike at &lt;u&gt;9:15AM sharp&lt;/u&gt;.  First, we Long Trail about 1.7 miles to get to Jay Peak (1176m, 3858 ft). Elevation gain is approx. 1680 ft.  There is a view point location, Jay Peak Tramway Station, at the summit.  (Book Time 1 Hr 50min)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) After reaching the summit of Jay Peak, we proceeded to down on Long Trail a few dozen steps further to find out herd path at left side.  This is the path we'll be taking to reach Big Jay.  Herd path hiking won't be so challenging except some short section of ledge scrambles. Elevation gain is approximately 466 ft.  &lt;br /&gt;It seems we are supposed to see the canister at the summit of Big Jay which we can sign off as proof of our hike.   I am unable to estimate book time well for this because it doesn't have maintained trail.  &lt;br /&gt;I would say one way may take 1 to 1.5 hours?   Big Jay looks like very steep, steeper than Jay Peak.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) We take same route to come back to the parking lot -- herd path + Long Trail.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Hiking Level:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Moderate   &lt;br /&gt;Hiking Distance:  estimated about 5.6 miles for round trip (might be inaccurate)  &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;If you only go to Jay Peak, then, RT would be 3.4 miles.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hiking Pace:  Slow to Moderate  &lt;br /&gt;Hiking Hours: 5+ hours + Lunch 30min + Break Time (Of course, hiking hours varies depending on your hiking pace)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;Suggested Meetup Locations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the parking lot of Jay Pass (Rt 242) &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;at 9AM&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;amp;source=s_d&amp;amp;saddr=VT-242+W&amp;amp;daddr=&amp;amp;geocode=FS9YrQIdOrKt-w&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;mra=prev&amp;amp;sll=44.69012,-72.856845&amp;amp;sspn=0.855239,1.148071&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=44.938557,-72.515945&amp;amp;spn=0.106445,0.143509&amp;amp;z=13"&gt;google map to show the trialhead location of Long Trail(Jay Pass). &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather check point is on 9/24, 9PM&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to drop me an email.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Organizer,    &lt;br /&gt;Tomoko Nakajima&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My car is Honda CR-V (Blue)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tomoko</member_name><member_id>8122788</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286336578000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281499129000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jay Peak &amp; Big Jay Hike in VT (NE HH list)</name><id>14387075</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286024400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14387075/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/e/global_17113470.jpeg</photo_url></item>
