We will either listen to a CD or watch a DVD at her home and then discuss it.  I was unable to find a place that would allow us to have meetings for free in the greater Portland area, except for Music Together in Yarmouth and Maine Beacon in Gorham, which people don't want to travel to.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone that signs up for the group for next week, I will email you her address.  The time for the group will be from 7-8:30 on Wednesday, September 29.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there.  Namaste.  Those of you that don't know what namaste means, you can either google it or I'll tell you next week.  My best to all,  Cheryl&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286123983000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>MegaMagnets</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PLOAConnection</urlname><id>1426391</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Laws of Attraction Connection</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285028146000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland LOA Connection Group</name><id>14838994</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285801200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PLOAConnection/events/14838994/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/5/global_14523685.jpeg</photo_url></item>
