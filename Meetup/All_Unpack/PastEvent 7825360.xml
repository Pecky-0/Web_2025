Please join us for the short hike in Blue Hill.  This Red Dot trail is rated  pretty easy and short...it takes about less than a half hour up and less than a half hour down. There will be a nice view at the top.....from there we can check out the Weather Observation Center. It costs about $3 per person to get into the observation tower if you would like to enter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a short hike, please wear comfortable clothes, sneaker is ok since is short distance. Hiking boot is great if you have a pair. Bring a bottle of water and  some snacks. I will bring OFF spray...share with you....in case there are bugs.  After the hike, we may go for coffee break or dinner.
