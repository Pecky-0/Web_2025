Drinks will be accepted in lieu of gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come out and celebrate with us starting at 8pm, and going until the bars close or until we are too ____ to walk! (fill in the blank!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows the management/owners of any downtown New Haven clubs/pubs/restaurants (and we could use you as a contact), please let me know so that we can fine-tune the route! Sullivan's and Rudy's are steps from my place (and Rudy's has Frites), so they would be great end-of-night stops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prime 16, 8-9:30p (If enough people show up around 8: 2 or 3 beers 1/2 half price @ $2.50!)&lt;br /&gt;Richter's, 9:30-10p (for a shot)&lt;br /&gt;Geronimo, 10-11:30p ($5 margaritas and $3 beers w/wristbands, thanks Selam!)&lt;br /&gt;GPSCY 11:30p-? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric's number is in his RSVP's; so is Dev's. A designee might step up as contact towards the event date, because I'm sure the shots will be flowing! :) I hope to see YOU there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Start Singing Happy Birthday (or a variant)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eric</member_name><member_id>2576129</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah</member_name><member_id>3741637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221674505000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>34</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219506667000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eric's birthday!
