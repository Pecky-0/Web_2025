&lt;p&gt;Jennifer lives with her partner Bennett on a small farm in Brooks, Maine. They make a living at their Whiffletree Nursery for which they graft trees and propagate fruiting shrubs and ornamentals. They grow their own food and meat and use a draft horse for farm work. Bennett began grafting over 20 years ago and made his living exclusively from nursery work and homesteading for many years. Jen began grafting about six years ago. Besides homesteading and growing trees, Jen works for Fedco Trees and guides wilderness trips. Bennett works on boats and is preparing to sail around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comments from the last time we ran this class:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;excellent instructors great at answering questions and returning to their 'lecture' well prepared materials enthusiastic and interesting attentive to providing one-on-one instruction during the grafting phase ..." &amp;ldquo; I thought the tree grafting workshop was great! The instructors were very knowledgeable, the atmosphere of the old barn was fun and it was a a nice group of people.... I learned a lot. &amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo; Wonderful experience! Bennett worked with me until he helped me find a way to use a right handed knire left-handedly! It was very exciting to then be able to actually graft apple trees!! &amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo; The experts were truly experts - That's very important for me. The materials provided were excellent (wide selection of scions, heatlthy root stock. Can't ask for anything more than this. Thanks to the organizers. &amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo; It was excellent! Loved the fact that we had time to practice with the experts. It helped gain confidence in the technique. Might be fun do to a followup with some other techniques."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Whitten</member_name><member_id>2670503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334661250000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332257812000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Workshop: Fruit Tree Grafting + 10 Tree "Take Home"</name><id>57111312</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334498400000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/57111312/</event_url></item>
