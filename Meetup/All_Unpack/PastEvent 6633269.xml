The restaurant is not able to accomodate a group larger than 10 people, so I wasn't able to increase the number of reservations for Sat.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since there is an interest in the event, I decided to do a second event on Sun the 18th for those that are unable to come to the Sat event.  Since the event is limited in the number of members that can attend, please don't RSVP unless you are certain that will be able to come.  If anyone RSVPed for Sat, but prefers to come Sun, feel free to change your reservation.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be there both nights and will look forward to see you all there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195603478000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193603025000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Russian Restaurant - part two</name><id>6633269</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195430400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/6633269/</event_url></item>
