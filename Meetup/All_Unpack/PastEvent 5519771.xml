<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The second meet-up will be outside.  I've picked Fort Washington Park in Cambridge again.  As the weather gets better, please feel free to make suggestions for new outdoor locations!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fort Washington is in Cambridge. It's on Waverly St between Erie and Putnam. Be careful if you google it! There's a Waverly Street in Brighton!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link for directions: &lt;br /&gt;Google Map &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Google does a pretty good job of providing directions. If you're having particular difficulty, let me know where you're coming from and I'll try to help! : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see everyone there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancellation procedure: If it is raining, too hot, too cold, etc. a cancellation notice will be sent via email and posted on the meetup website 2 hours prior to the meetup time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Meetup.com charges each group a $15 a month meetup fee. This is a GROUP fee and if not paid, our Boston French Bulldog meetups, would not exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is in charge of paying this fee every month. It would be greatly appreciated if at each meetup, each member can submit a donation that goes towards the monthly $15 fee. Give $1, give $10. If at the end of the meetup, the organizer has not collected enough to meet the $15, she will pay the difference. If she receives more than $15, the extra would go towards the next meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to allow payment by PayPal, I had to put a minimum &amp;quot;Suggested Donation.&amp;quot; This is just to cover the meetup.com fee. You can give whatever you feel is appropriate. The cost is $15 per month, so you don't have to give every month either. Whatever works for you. And you can do it through PayPal or at the MeetUp. Hope this helps!! &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175004169000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172613276000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>2nd March Boston Frenchie Meet-Up</name><id>5519771</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174831200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/5519771/</event_url></item>
