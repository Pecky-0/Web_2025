Glastonbury's Riverfront Park (Welles St.) - Wednesday, August 1 (beautiful forecast!).

Take the FREE SHUTTLE bus (run every 10 minutes) from 180 &amp; 200 Glastonbury Boulevard (adjacent to Somerset Square) to the Riverfront Summer Music Festival - Welles Street, Glastonbury  06033.  MapQuest directions to the Shuttle busses!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Show starts @ 7:00; aim to catch a SHUTTLE BUS @ 6:00 so we can GATHER @ 6:30 &lt;&lt;&lt; 

Riverfront Summer Music Festival - Formally the Summer Music Series on the Hubbard Green has moved to the Riverfront Community Park on Welles Street.

LOOK FOR: I'll have a blue-on-blue UHaul moving blanket with two red reflectors atop white sticks, which may have balloons attached (low to the ground to not block the view of others).  Al R. may bring his orange traffic cones.  We typically gather 1/2 to all the way back to not be too near loudspeakers, and to allow us to talk and party without disturbing the performers.  If necessary, call my Cell# from an easy-to-locate spot and I'll direct you to us.

This is a combined MeetUp &amp; Single Event gathering... typically 12-24 SINGLE "regulars" and "newbies" gather each time for a fun mix!

&gt;&gt;&gt; BYOB and snacks/Picnic dinner, if you'd like.  As always, be discreet, don't litter, and drive responsibly!  NOTE: We typically stay at the venue and continue partying while the traffic clears.  We'll likely catch the latest shuttle back to our cars, then optionally regroup back at the park, or possibly at a private residence, so bring extra munchies, etc. "just in case"!
