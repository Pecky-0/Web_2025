<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We'll be conducting an experiment in EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) in a local cemetery.  No equipment necessary to participate, but if you have a recorder (digital or tape or both) bring it/them along.  We'll be starting from my apartment - it's a very easy walking distance to the destination from there - and I have cats, so if you have an allergy to them, let me know in advance and we can meet you outside.  I'm limiting the size of this meetup to 6 to prevent the group from being too invasive a presence once the experiment begins.  Afterwards (or perhaps during) I'd like to discuss how we should proceed with regard to investigating our first site.  Any questions, please e-mail me as soon as they arise.  See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>andy</member_name><member_id>5342211</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195492464000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Paranormal Believers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastParanormal</urlname><id>751976</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Seacoast Paranormal Research Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194631064000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>EVP Experiment!</name><id>6709901</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195257600000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastParanormal/events/6709901/</event_url></item>
