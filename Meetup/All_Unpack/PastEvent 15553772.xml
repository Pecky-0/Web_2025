We'll start the day with a steaming hot cup of coffee and light breakfast at Stonewall Kitchen. Here is the link with the directions:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stonewallkitchen.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.stonewallkitchen.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee hour will run from 9:30 to approximately 10:30.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we will follow each other up to Laudholm Farm in Wells.  One of my friends (an experienced AMC hiker) and I will lead a slow paced hike of about 3 - 4 miles lasting about 2 hours or so. This is a really beautiful spot and I have had a lot of requests to do a hike here. Due to all the tourists and traffic in the summer, there is only a limited window of opportunity to hike and enjoy this beautiful wooded setting on the ocean replete with birds and other wildlife! Here is the link to their web page:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wellsreserve.org/visit/" target="_blank"&gt;www.wellsreserve.org/visit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click on trail system for details on the trails. Note that they do charge an entrance fee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we will be starved after all that hiking and fresh air, so we will conclude with a light lunch at Mike's Clam Shack (think a nice hot bowl of steaming chowder&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;  or broiled haddock among many other delights!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the restaurant and menu:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mikesclamshack.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.mikesclamshack.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully you can join us for this great Meetup. As always contact me if you have any questions or need more information on the directions to Stonewall Kitchen.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy  &lt;br /&gt;RandyS@maine.rr.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a silver Subaru Forester about halfway down the length of this very long parking lot.
