Lyric Studio productions are always excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Producing Artistic Director Spiro Veloudos, &amp;quot;this new, shorter adaptation streamlines the narrative, and captures Dickens' genius for combining exuberant characters, theatrical spectacle, and genuine emotion.&amp;quot; A cast of 25 plays over 150 characters in this remarkable two-part play with music. Winner of both the Tony Award for Best Play and The Olivier Award for Play of the Year, it has never been produced in Boston. We're pulling out all the stops for this incredible once-in-a-lifetime experience that is &amp;quot;teeming with character, atmosphere, and incident, a place where inhumanity rules until, eventually, virtue is triumphant.&amp;quot; (The New York Times) Sponsored in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Part One of a two part show running in repertory. (NOTE: I'm not sure where and when Part 2 happens but if we like Part One we can always schedule that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner after the show..for those who'd like to join us. I haven't decided where yet but suggestions are always welcome. (This is an early birthday celebration for me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the  foyer (on the 2nd floor)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ange</member_name><member_id>7061103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287975231000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287449293000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Life and Adventures of Nicholas NIckleby Part One</name><id>15153416</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287860400000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/15153416/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/global_18876068.jpeg</photo_url></item>
