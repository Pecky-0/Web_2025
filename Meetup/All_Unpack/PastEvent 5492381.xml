The assistant organizers have been meeting with Dale, our new organizer, and we are getting all our ideas ready for presenting to you on Wednesday, March 7. Since we do not have the previous RSVPs, please RSVP here, and help us make this what it needs to be for all of you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary focus of this general meetup is for NETWORKING, answering each other's organizer problems, discussing our MEETUP FAIR, and having some fun with one another. We will send you more information very soon, with a clear agenda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are working on a space that will be comfortable for 50 to 60 people, possibly in Central Square. Please RSVP and save the night for MOM. As soon as it is determined, we will let you know. We want to see all of you there. &lt;a href="http://organizer.meetup.com/53/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dale</member_name><member_id>3116571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173504742000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Organizers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NEOrganizers</urlname><id>321127</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>New England Meetup Organizers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171830287000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>M.O.M.
