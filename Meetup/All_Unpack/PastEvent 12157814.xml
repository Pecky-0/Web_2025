They rival Sound bites, and Ball square and are worth making the trip out even just to sample their fare once. I highly recommend the pancakes! I wanted to schedule this for Friday, but the restaurant is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Breakfast we will ride till 2-3 PM or the weather turns on us, which ever comes first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is a breakfast event it is open to all members and there is no fee, even though there is a ride afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain/snow date TBA if event is cancelled &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Helmets/scooters</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262616471000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261982557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Take your scooter to Breakfast - 2010 Premiere</name><id>12157814</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262442600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/12157814/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/8/global_12405272.jpeg</photo_url></item>
