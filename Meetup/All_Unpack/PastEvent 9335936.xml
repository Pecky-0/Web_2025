Just a reminder that we will have a Sunday meetup on the second weekend of the month for the Winter, and a Saturday meetup on the last weekend of the month.  More fun for the dogs!&lt;br /&gt;Check out the place:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.doggieday.com/home.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.doggieday....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doggie Day care does not charge us to use their faciity so I encourage you to make purchases at their boutique or use them for other services (grooming, sitting etc) as this is an awesome place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Terri &amp;amp; Simon &amp;amp; Louie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancellation procedure: Unless there is a snowstorm we are on! I'll email around 8AM if the weather we cancel.  Please use your discretion driving in foul weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Meetup.com charges each group a $15 a month meetup fee. This is a GROUP fee and if not paid, our Boston French Bulldog meetups, would not exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is in charge of paying this fee every month. It would be greatly appreciated if at each meetup, each member can submit a donation that goes towards the monthly $15 fee. Give $1, give $10. If at the end of the meetup, the organizer has not collected enough to meet the $15, she will pay the difference. If she receives more than $15, the extra would go towards the next meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll see you inside-just ask for the Frencie Meetup</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233418406000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229270792000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston French Bulldog January Meetup</name><id>9335936</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231686000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/9335936/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/f/3/global_6429059.jpeg</photo_url></item>
