I apologize for deciding on the TBD movie at the last moment. I was hoping to find some consensus in the responses, which didn't happen until today. The movie is &lt;b&gt;Conviction&lt;/b&gt;, starring Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilary Swank plays a Massachusetts mother whose older brother (Sam Rockwell) is sentenced to life in prison for murder. Convinced that he is innocent, she dedicates herself to overturning the conviction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is playing at 7:05 at Showcase in Worcester. Let's meet in the lobby at about 6:45. We can meetup for food and drinks and conversation afterwards. Call my cell phone if you need to contact me: 508-981-0455.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- David&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my photo - Not Josey Wales.
