Buy your tickets by tomorrow evening on buywithme.com!!!  I hope you see you there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a direct link to the deal page:  &lt;a href="http://www.buywithme.com/boston/deals/1040-new-england-revolution" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.buywithme....&lt;/a&gt;  Make sure you get a ticket for the game on the 7th - that's when we'll be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you make the purchase you'll be emailed a link to a voucher for download.  We bring these to will-call to pick up our tickets and free t-shirt.  This way we can meet ahead of time and organize sitting together!&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________________________________________________  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;Would anyone be interested in going to the New England Revolution game versus DC United on August 7th?  There is a special on buywithme.com for a ticket and a tshirt for $20... or I could look into group tickets which can be priced either at $21.00 or $30.00 depending on where we want to sit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special on buywithme.com is only available for 4 more days and I think the downside might be we might not sit together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if this is something we all want to do!  And if this is a good date for you and your significant other!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Get there by 6:30!
