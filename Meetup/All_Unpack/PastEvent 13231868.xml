I was unable to put the book down from start to finish.  Although some of the stories seem too crazy to be true, I can assure you they are honest accounts of where our deployment took us. From the unstable leadership, to the drug-induced sleep, every story is exactly how I had remembered it. I'm proud to have served with Anthony, and I'm proud of the courage he had to put this book out there for people to see. (Just as he had warned fellow soldiers about the dangers of a questionable vaccine). I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the truth about modern combat.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rachael McIntosh</member_name><member_id>5611356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274398834000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Inquisitive Minds</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FreedomIsFundamental</urlname><id>1191429</id><group_lat>41.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4599990845</group_lon><name>FREEDOM IS FUNDAMENTAL Book Club and Discussion Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271728112000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE Lecture: Michael Anthony author of MASS CASUALTIES</name><id>13231868</id><headcount>28</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274133600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FreedomIsFundamental/events/13231868/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/d/a/global_14512570.jpeg</photo_url></item>
