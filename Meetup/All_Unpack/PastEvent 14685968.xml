<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This September marks the 30th Anniversary of Terry Fox's courageous marathon of hope. Terry Fox started his &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; in Newfoundland and had to end his marathon on Sept 1, 1980 after cancer spread to both of his lungs. In 143 days Terry ran 3339 miles. On June 28, 1981 Terry passes away from cancer; one month short of his 23rd birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Nash has made a short documentary about Terry and this will be premiering on Tuesday September 28 at 8 PM. I am an organizing a night to remember Terry's marathon of hope. At 6:30 PM we will meet at the Tavern in the square and have a short 5K run in his honour. Afterwards we'll watch the film. Please bring donations for cancer research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't want to run just come around 7:30 PM as that is when we'll be getting back from the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew</member_name><member_id>2881088</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285769462000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283883475000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Terry Fox's Marathon of Hope - 30th Anniversary</name><id>14685968</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285713000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/14685968/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/0/global_17785984.jpeg</photo_url></item>
