It fits all our criteria except that it's rather long so, if you're interested in joining us, sign up soon and get started.  Several people have mentioned that it's one of their favorite books so I'm really looking forward to reading it.  Our July selection is still unconfirmed (the problem is that I have to make a choice between several great books) but our August book will be &amp;quot;The Girl Who Played With Fire&amp;quot;, Steig Larrson's second book in his famous trilogy.  The third book comes out tomorrow and I've been counting the days.  We read &amp;quot;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&amp;quot; in April and there were many requests that we read the second and third books. &lt;br /&gt;     Check back in a few days and I'll have July's book posted.  Also, if you think you want to join us in June, sign up soon as the 20 slots were taken quickly last month.  If you say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; but your plans change, please be considerate of other readers and change your response to &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;.  We had 12 readers for May but 20 had said yes and many people who wanted to come were left on the waiting list.  This is really important for any meetup group.  Thanks everyone for all your support this year.  It's been fun and informative and I'm looking forward to reading the books for the months ahead.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elaine    </member_name><member_id>7294680</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277764417000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274657219000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Brookline Book Club</name><id>13572216</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277668800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/13572216/</event_url></item>
