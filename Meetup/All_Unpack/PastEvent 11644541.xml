A slide presentation and Q &amp;amp; A session. We welcome Mark Basile who has examined the dust under a scanning electron microscope and devised apparati to determine the ignition temperature of some special pieces found in the dust. This will OPEN your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark met Dr. Steven Jones, who wrote one of the first scholarly papers asking &lt;a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/200609/WhyIndeedDidtheWorldTradeCenterBuildingsCompletelyCollapse.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Completely Collapse?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, at a Boston Tea Party for 9/11 event in December 0f 2007 and joined him in the independent research of some of the remaining forensice evidence of the 9/11 tragedy - the dust that covered everything for blocks around the WTC site in Lower Manhattan. Mark has examined the samples to determine the exact composition of certain iron-containing particles and confirmed Dr. Jones' findings. There are iron micro-spheres in the dust and also red-gray particles containing unignited thermite. The question becomes then &amp;quot;Since these materials don't appear in normal building materials, why are they in the WTC collapse dust?&amp;quot; Come see the report of Mark's findings and draw your own conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Basile will present his report first, followed by a question and answer session. (In the coming days, we'll post a copy of Mark's presentation in our files area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, make the popcorn and stay for Loose Change - Final Cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Loose Change series is a good introduction to the public. The first Loose Change swept the internet and was responsible for thousands of internet-savvy people becoming aware of the 9/11 issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the official website to purchase a copy on DVD: &lt;a href="http://loosechange911.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://loosechange911...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring your blank DVDs&lt;/b&gt; to the meeting and be sure to get a copy of each video we screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We won't have time for other short videos this time, but bring your favorites for us to choose from for viewing in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We have screenings every Tuesday&lt;/b&gt; somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: 1st Tuesday-Nashua; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; &lt;b&gt;3rd Tuesday-Concord&lt;/b&gt;; the 4th Tuesday is open for a more northern meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at 6:30&lt;/b&gt; if you can, in order to help set up the healthy snacks and beverages (that you bring to share with others - a box of tea for Jim's inventory would be appreciated) and enjoy the pre-meeting networking.
