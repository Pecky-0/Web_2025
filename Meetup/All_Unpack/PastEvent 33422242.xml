Thirty-eight year old graphic artist Oliver Fields has just lost his father Hal Fields to cancer, after Oliver's mother Georgia Fields passed away five years earlier. Oliver embarks on a relationship with Anna, a French actress and he is hoping that the re-energized relationship he had with is father after Georgia's death will show Oliver how to act in a loving relationship.
