This first meeting will be to get to know each other and our Qigong backgrounds and interests. We can also talk about dues, special events, meeting format, topics and days for future meetings, and if time, cultivate some Qi! Please bring your ideas for future topics - example, history of Qigong, different types of Qigong, Jing, Qi, Shen (essence, energy and spirit), how Qigong is related to acupuncture and Chinese medicine, etc. I expect the meeting will last 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Feel free to email me if you have any questions. I hope to see as many of you as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Dee&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The Lucia Mastrangelo Meeting Room is on the 2nd floor.
