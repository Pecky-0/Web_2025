My only request is for you to let me know as soon as possible so we don't worry about you and our reservation is adjusted. As long as you contact me you will not be considered a NO-SHOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rules for Events with Reservations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the meal and you are not able to attend or are running late, you MUST call or text me at (617) 445-7549.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All RSVPs are on a first reply, first seated basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may only RSVP YES or NO.
