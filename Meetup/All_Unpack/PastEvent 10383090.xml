<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For those of you who know my intense love of coverbands, you will understand my immense excitement when I discovered &amp;quot;Cover Up!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pulled from the &amp;quot;Cover Up&amp;quot; website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Cover Up is a Boston based band playing a wide variety of great songs for their audiences. Out in front is Chris Bianchi (Guitar ace&amp;amp;singer,)and Tino Sanchez (Electric Bass&amp;amp;backing vocals.) In the middle are the blues-laden vocals of Billy Dezotell. Holding it all down on drums is Joe Taranto. This quartet of musicians has a desire to stay true (most of the time) to the original arrangments of the songs from the artists we chose to cover.We also have some fun with segues and even take requests from the crowd. If we know it,we'll play it. We aim to entertain the audience and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a rich history present here as Chris and Tino have been jamming together for 20 years. Ten of those years with drummer,Joe. Billy D hopped on board a couple of years after that and the chemistry was then rounded off. A magical chemistry it is too.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a skilled band and a rad bar - lets get a group of dancers who can boogie to all the favorite classic rock/80s/90s tunes!  check the &lt;a href="http://www.coverupmusic.com/songlist.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;song list&lt;/a&gt; here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you get there before 9 - no cover.  after 9, $5 cover (still totally worth it!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>rsvp for details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249344358000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242014374000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cover Up at the Burren</name><id>10383090</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249088400000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10383090/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/7/global_8580087.jpeg</photo_url></item>
