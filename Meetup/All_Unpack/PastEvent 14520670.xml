<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;Who's up for a challenging last minute midweek 4k footer hike? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather is supposed to be cool, clear and sunny on Tuesday - perfect for hiking!  We are going to hike Mt Whiteface with a possible loop over to Mt Passaconaway if time permits.  Hike will be up the Blueberry Ledges trail to the summit of Whiteface. Although the summit of Whiteface is wooded, the ledges before the summit offer some fantastic views.  If time permits we will take the Rollins trail to Passaconaway and down Dicey's Mill for a loop.  If not we'll come back down the Blueberry Ledges trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiteface Up &amp;amp; Back  is about 8 miles with a book time of about 7 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiteface &amp;amp; Passaconaway Loop is about 12 miles with a book time of about 9:16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike is has some steep sections with rock scrambling and will most likely be slippery due to the rain from the last few days.  According to the AMC guide, the Blueberry Ledges trail is considered one of the most challenging in the White Mountains.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we won't be running the trail, the plan is to finish in less than book time and still enjoy the views along the way.  Please be aware of your abilities before signing on.  This is not a beginner hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Ferncroft parking area (look for a pirate flag) at 9:00 with a departure time of NLT 9:15.  Since this is last minute I won't see any RSVPs after 6AM.  Feel free to call me (Edzo) on my cell at 207-438-9216. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Lat:43.91339 Lon:-71.35808)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rt 16 North, until the Chocorua region. 113 West, until Tamworth, then Rt 113-A until the trail head.
