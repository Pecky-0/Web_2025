For those of you who fell asleep reading Shakespeare in high school English class, his plays are actually really funny onstage. And you can't beat the ticket price for this one -- only $5. The play is being performed by the &lt;a href="http://www.trinityrep.com/education/mfa_program/mfa_program.php" target="_blank"&gt;Brown &amp;amp; Trinity Rep Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, by second-year acting students. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is general admission, so we can sit together. Let's meet in the lobby at 7 p.m. After the play, we can head 'round the corner to &lt;a href="http://www.trinitybrewhouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Trinity Brewhouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $5. &lt;b&gt;Please buy your own ticket in advance&lt;/b&gt; through &lt;a href="http://www.trinityrep.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Trinity Rep&lt;/a&gt; Box Office by phone (401) 351-4242 and online at www.trinityrep.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;The Tempest by William Shakespeare&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Christopher Windom '10&lt;br /&gt;Verse workshop production with 2nd year student actors&lt;br /&gt;Shakespeareâ€™s most magical tale of the powerful and reclusive magician, capable of manipulating man and nature.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's meet in the lobby at 7 pm -- I'll have a Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243034784000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>theater lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>ritheatre</urlname><id>790390</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Theater Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1233962415000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Tempest -- Shakespeare -- Brown &amp; Trinity Rep</name><id>9690126</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241305200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ritheatre/events/9690126/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/3/global_6290483.jpeg</photo_url></item>
