&lt;p&gt;I am writing to request volunteers to come help us prepare and serve a meal for Boston's less fortunate on Saturday May 11.  The Kitchen Executive on Saturday will be Mike Goldsmith. Please check in with Mike upon your arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday/Sunday's Bread (SSB) serves meals every Saturday and Sunday, at St. John's the Evangelist Church (35 Bowdoin Street, Beacon Hill, Boston). We ask volunteers to come at 12:30pm and stay until 4:30pm (12:30pm - 2:30pm Dining hall setup/Meal Preparation, 2:30pm - 3:30pm Volunteers serve the meals to guests, 3:30pm - 4:30pm Clean - up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. John's is conveniently located in downtown Boston near the State House and is easily accessible via the T. There are also several parking lots nearby. There is metered parking on the streets in front of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come to volunteer, please use the handicapped accessible ramp entrance on the right hand side of the church, and press all the doorbells so we hear you in the dining hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NOTE for those using GPS: We are on Beacon Hill, not in Dorchester - the zip code for St. John's the Evangelist is 02114 - please make sure you use this so you don't end up in the wrong location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For logistical information, please visit our website at SatSunBread.org. In existence for over twenty (20) years, SB has no paid staff and no office. We serve Boston's less fortunate with compassion, efficiency of resources, and fun. Please join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please sign up if you are 100% sure you can make it. If you aren't 100%, but want to be on our email list, please shoot me an email. We are here every weekend, so if you cannot help this particular weekend, there will be plenty of need on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can come down, please RSVP. Thank you very much for your generosity of spirit, and we hope to see many of you on the 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very truly yours,&lt;/p&gt;
