 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Steve Glines&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;has spent most of his career as a journalist with a reputation as an edgy technical writer. For five years he authored a monthly technical advice column titled Panic in Altos World Magazine. The column was written in the voice of a fictionalized, over-caffeinated, sleep-deprived, computer engineer working for the mob. He also wrote a column titled Famous Last Words for Unix Review about products that never quite materialized or never lived up to their promise. He is the author or co-author of five "trade textbooks," a travelogue about teaching in Fiji, a flash fiction/ poetry chapbook and a novel in search of a publisher. For the past eight years he has been the editor/publisher of Wilderness House Literary Review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
