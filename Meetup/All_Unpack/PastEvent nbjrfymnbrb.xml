Our last meeting was at the Reading Senior Center on Pleasant Street and everyone liked it much better than the library so I will try to rent that room for future meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to ask all of you to think of becoming an assistant organizer of the meeting so monthly meetings will always be possible.  With the winter months approaching I don't intend to be flying as much and would like you to have meetings regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donations were enough to cover my costs last month and I thank you all for donating. If levels keep up I will be in the black for the first time in two years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am having many issues with computer and e-mails from AOL.  If you need to contact me call 623-251-7547 or e-mail me at my new e-mail btzee6@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one with the briefcase and all the papers in front of me.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1259887411000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252454557000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia October Meetup</name><id>nbjrfymnbrb</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255474800000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/11322989/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_1805463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
