The snow is nearly gone and the trees are beginning to bud. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the glory that is spring in NH finally upon us, it is time to break out the grill and spend some outdoors time before summer vacations take over the time remaining from our long overdue break from the cold. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome you all to come and join us for an evening of eating, drinking, discussion and good times in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do ask that you please bring your own booze and a little something to share with everyone. Chips, soda, your favorite salad etc. so we can be sure there will be enough food to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be providing burgers, hot dogs and chicken. There will be cheese and plain burgers, veggie burgers, Jamaican jerk burgers with orange chipotle mayonnaise, hot dogs of course and jerk chicken with pineapple papaya salsa.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;If the weather looks like it's going to be bad, I will reschedule this event and will provide at least 24 hours notice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom</member_name><member_id>4294423</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1211234948000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><why>Meet new people, enjoy the weather and great food.</why><group><who>SeaLs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nhseacoastliberty</urlname><id>950500</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>NH Seacoast Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>37</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208461048000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Outdoor Cookout at the Hudson's</name><id>7758835</id><headcount>47</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211061600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nhseacoastliberty/events/7758835/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/8/8/global_3826744.jpeg</photo_url></item>
