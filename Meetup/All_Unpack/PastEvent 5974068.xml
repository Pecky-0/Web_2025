<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>UPDATE:  &gt;&gt;&gt; Look for me/us:  FACING the Town Hall stage... find us on the RIGHT half of the crowd mid-way back, or farther, toward the Bloomfield Ave. side rather than the Park Ave. side.  No Balloons, just a blue U-Haul blanket and 2 red reflectors atop white sticks!  If you can't find us, call my cell# from an easy-to-spot location and I'll direct you to us by waving a reflector.  Also, look for Al-R's orange traffic cones.   &lt;&lt;&lt;

NOTE: The Single Event's "Thirsty Thursday" group is being invited to join us for this event.  During the summer months, we are trying to do more casual, BYO type gatherings, featuring different types of outdoor musical entertainment, moving around to various towns to encourage new folks to join us and make new friends! Typically 8-24 come together each time.  These new introductions lead to invitations to each other's events and the opportunity to enjoy varied activities and make even more new friends! 

&gt;&gt;&gt; BYOB and snacks/Picnic dinner, if you'd like.  As always, be discreet, don't litter, and drive responsibly! 

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gather @ 6:30.  Show starts @ 7:00.  Some optionlly stay after the concert ends (and/or move to some other nearby park or private home) to continue the party!  In anticipation of this, please bring with you, extra food and beverage! 

IF RAIN: concert will be moved indoors - however, we'll more likely go to a bar! 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not applicable... it's gonna be a BEAUTIFUL night to listen to "FREE Live Outdoor Music"!

See you there!
