I'll bring utensils and paper plates. If it starts to rain, we will re-locate to the tables inside of the Collis Center. Either way, look for a sign on the table that says &amp;quot;Vegan.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a dish to share and (if at all possible) label the ingredients. This will help us to avoid any discrepancies that may occur as a result of people having different interpretations of which foods are considered to be &amp;quot;vegan&amp;quot; (ex. honey, white sugar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome vegans, vegetarians and omnivores at our Meetup events. However, because this is a vegan potluck, we ask that any dishes that you bring be vegan (no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no gelatin). If you have any questions about whether a food item satisfies these criteria or if you need suggestions of easy dishes to make/buy, please feel free to contact me: Lauren.A.Thompson@Dartmouth.edu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this meeting, we will also discuss plans for future Vegan Meetup events. Please contact me if you have suggestions for future Meetups but are unable to attend this one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lola</member_name><member_id>915277</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258833762000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pioneers of Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-430</urlname><id>650201</id><group_lat>43.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2699966431</group_lon><name>NH/VT Vegan Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1252968547000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vegan Potluck</name><id>11372106</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254070800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-430/events/11372106/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/global_1994793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
