We'll see surf crashing against rocks, small secluded beaches, pretty folliage and fauna, and maybe even a couple seals out in the surf.  This hilly, paved path is approx. 1 mi. one way, so we'll be taking a leisurely 2 mi. walk.  There's plenty of time to visit the secluded beach too, or sit on the rocks.  It's such a relaxing spot...very meditative!   After the walk, we'll stroll through the quaint fishing village of Perkins Cove and view it's tiny harbor jammed with lobster boats before settling in at the very rustic &amp;quot;The Shack&amp;quot;.  Sitting at indoor picnic tables, we can choose from delicious steamed clams, lobster bisque, crab rolls, haddock sandwiches, etc., or just beers and wine coolers.  Acoustic entertainment may very likely be there for our enjoyment too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the Marginal Way trailhead across the street from Barnacle Billys in Perkins Cove at 4pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tall guy (6'4") with glasses</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285595202000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284835023000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Marginal Way" walk on Ogunquit coast and "Lobster Shack" afterward</name><id>14814857</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285444800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/14814857/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/global_3462226.jpeg</photo_url></item>
