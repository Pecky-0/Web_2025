With Brazilian music on Tuesday nights, Basha Cafe is an ideal place for a meetup. It's a lovely restaurant with Middle Eastern food--beautiful decor, good food, and the tables are even already set up perfectly for a meetup! There's also space for dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm scheduling some of the best players and singers of Brazilian music in Boston, to make these nights a feast for the ears, as well as the appetite! The bands play all different kinds of music with Brazilian roots, so you can expand your knowledge of the music of Brazil at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the deal: we meet at 7:00 for eats/drinks and conversa; music starts around 8. There's NO COVER; you just need to buy something to eat or drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll schedule the meetups each week so we can get a count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next week -- September 29 -- we will listen to the music of the Lúcia Regina Brazilian Trio. Lúcia is a native of Brazil and she will perform bossa nova, samba, and forró, with Luiz Silva on guitar and André Carvalho on percussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of free parking around the restaurant; 10-15 minute walk from Alewife T. New Street is behind the Fresh Pond shopping Center, off Concord Ave. Also bus no. 74 from Harvard Square (Bennett Alley stop--near Charles Hotel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Espero que todos venham, a semana que vem e todas as terças!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evelyn</member_name><member_id>4577146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254621177000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253679811000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conversa e Musica at Basha Cafe</name><id>11444154</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254265200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/events/11444154/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/c/global_1153820.jpeg</photo_url></item>
