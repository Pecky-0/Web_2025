Please come prepared to have a fun and interesting evening speaking with German speakers from all over the world! Countries represented have been: Germany, Austria, France, Sri Lanka, Russia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Peru, India.  We  meet on the first and third Thursdays of each month so in July it will be July 5 and 19.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, we have many more people show up than the RSVP would indicate.&lt;br /&gt;Dianne  &lt;br /&gt;Note:  If you Mapquest Panera, it might send you to the wrong place!  It is at Bishop's Corner Shopping Center, next to Staples, intersection of Routes 44 &amp;amp; 218.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>3815102</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541715000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Deutsch speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>german-425</urlname><id>438488</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6900024414</group_lon><name>The West Hartford German Kaffeeklatsch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183681599000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The West Hartford German Kaffeeklatsch July Meetup</name><id>5980531</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184886900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/german-425/events/5980531/</event_url></item>
