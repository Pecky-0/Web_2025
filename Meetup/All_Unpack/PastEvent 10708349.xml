The RICKA Flatwater Group will be holding its next Basic Flatwater Paddling Class on Sunday, July 19th. In this 3-hour class, paddlers will learn the basic strokes and maneuvers to control their boats on flatwater. We will also cover basic rescue techniques. The class will take place at Stump Pond in Smithfield and will be free for RICKA members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class size is limited to 25 paddlers. Attendance is on a first-come, first-serve basis. Please do not reserve a spot unless you are 100% certain that you can attend. If you cancel at the last minute, you will have tied up a spot that someone else could have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are a new paddler, you are crazy to pass this up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will not be there.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248533633000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SNEP-1</urlname><id>1360815</id><group_lat>41.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-72.1100006104</group_lon><name>Southern New England Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245692221000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RICKA Flatwater Training</name><id>10708349</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248022800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SNEP-1/events/10708349/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/e/0/global_6975552.jpeg</photo_url></item>
