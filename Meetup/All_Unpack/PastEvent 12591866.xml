<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi, everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to paranormal investigations or just want to brush up on your skills, please join us for a Paranormal Investigation 101 class, followed by an investigation of a historic building  with a reputation for being paranormally active. Afterward, we'll head to a nearby pub for dinner and discussion of the investigation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: When you register, please say whether or not you will be going to dinner, so that I have an accurate count for the dinner reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a joint meetup, for Footprints Paranormal and Central MA Wiccan meetups, and spaces are limited, so I encourage you to register soon. If you want to attend and don't have an opportunity to do so this time, please let me know, so that I can plan another class later in the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class will cover the following:&lt;br /&gt;* Introduction (current theories on what is a ghost, types of hauntings, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;* Do's and don'ts for investigations&lt;br /&gt;* How to prepare for and conduct an investigation (note: we will not be covering how to do a formal  investigation of a client's private residence--it is beyond the scope of this class)&lt;br /&gt;* Protection (how to ground yourself and keep yourself safe during an investigation)&lt;br /&gt;* Equipment basics (includes practice with basic equipment)&lt;br /&gt;* Q and A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Investigation:&lt;br /&gt;We'll be investigating the second floor of a large historic building in Sturbridge.
