First stop: the library. This is the main branch of the Boston Public Library, in Copley Square -- right by the Copley Square T stop, and not too far from our old location. We'll be on the second floor of the Johnson Building. Enter from Boylston St., walk up the stairs under the giant American flag, and turn right. We'll grab one of the big tables. There will be a sign, but call if you get lost: Jess at 423 863 4344.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a work in progress and spend an hour or two writing with other writers.  Take the opportunity to discuss new ideas, encourage each other to meet self set goals, share websites and resources... Or just focus on your writing and see how much you can get done with a little dedicated time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess</member_name><member_id>9894327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1299716920000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299027591000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Writing: NEW LOCATION</name><id>16759829</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1299712500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/16759829/</event_url></item>
