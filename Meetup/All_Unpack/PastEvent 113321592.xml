DVWM is hosting Looking at Negative Space in Three Dimensional Design: A Trans-Disciplinary Design Presentation by Designer Carey Baker, and Discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSVPing at DVWM would be helpful :) &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Less is more. We mostly focus on positive space in the world but what about the negative space. You need both to feel balanced. Lets start a dialog about this empty void that is a requirement to 2D and 3D design. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Negative Space, also called White Space, is the space around and between objects in a two dimensional or three dimensional design. Using negative space effectively is an art in itself, and is often the lynch pin that gives power to a good design. Is the spacing too cramped or too loose, or does it have that certain presence of "just right"? Is the shape it creates a strong design element in itself? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Negative Space is considered in everything from the leading in type, to photography, graphic design, painting and sculpture, to the design of products, interiors, and public parks. In this discussion we will work to understand how to use this important tool to create power in our designs. &lt;br /&gt;
