She will be hosting a Friday night Meetup in her transformed garage, nicknames Studio 184.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie has some games and darts, but she requests you bring any favorites.  People are also welcome to bring food and drinks.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Meetup is indoor/outdoor, please dress for the weather (and perhaps be prepared with bug spray).&lt;br /&gt;Parking is available in front of the house, and on side streets: Northend Ave. and Liberty Hill Ave.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245097299000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242949779000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Game Night at Studio 184</name><id>10466558</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1244847600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/10466558/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/8/9/global_3094489.jpeg</photo_url></item>
