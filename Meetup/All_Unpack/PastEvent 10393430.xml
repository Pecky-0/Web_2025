<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join us for our regular monthly meetup and gather some wild black raspberries! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black raspberries should be ripe and the wild berry patch is a great spot for a brief talk on how different plants reclaim the land through a series of successional growths. We'll also talk a bit about &amp;quot;invasives&amp;quot;- how and why they appear and a bit about the controversy over their bad reputations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup is schuduled to start earlier than usual to allow people to spend a little more time picking berries. Those who can't arrive at 6:30 are welcome to join the group later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loose agenda:&lt;br /&gt;6:30 Meet and greet in the house&lt;br /&gt;6:45 Move to the berry patch and start picking&lt;br /&gt;7:00 Start talk on succession and invasives and continue picking&lt;br /&gt;7:45 Share a potluck meal &lt;br /&gt;8:30 Wrap up and take your berries home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please:&lt;br /&gt;Bring a collection container for your berries&lt;br /&gt;Wear appropriate clothing for wading through grass and dealing with thorns&lt;br /&gt;Bring a potluck dish to share with the group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal in the berry patch</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Dion</member_name><member_id>6134374</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247419566000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Permaculture Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1360397</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Northshore Permaculture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242136910000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meetup- Wild Berry Picking Potluck</name><id>10393430</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246487400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northshore-Permaculture-Meetup-Group/events/10393430/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/7/global_7064327.jpeg</photo_url></item>
