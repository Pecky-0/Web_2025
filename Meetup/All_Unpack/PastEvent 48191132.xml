&lt;p&gt;We'll get the popcorn popping and have out some movie games like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinemaplexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scene-It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movie Title Celebrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any other film-themed games, please bring them. Whether you're a cinemaphile or you just like playing games, we look forward to seeing you. We welcome new players with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have popcorn and plenty to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats, but they will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to a 3 year old, who will be headed to bed as people arrive. We also have a twelve month old, who isn't much of a game player, but he will eventually go to bed as well. Expect to see him awake while you are here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*If there is a snow emergency, this event will be cancelled. Should it look like we'll receive snow that evening, we will be in contact via e-mail. Otherwise, you are always welcome to call to verify.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330296178000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326648366000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oscar Weekend Movie Game Night</name><id>48191132</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330218000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/48191132/</event_url></item>
