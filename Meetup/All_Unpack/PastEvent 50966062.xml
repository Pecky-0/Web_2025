&lt;p&gt;My telephone number is: 603-312-6735&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some example of the games we will be playing are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rinse and Giggle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#65279;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try not to laugh while your mouth is filled with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive. Little or no movement is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 or more players&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cups, Water, Timer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone gathers in a circle. Each holds a cup of water. On the count of three everyone takes a drink and fill there mouth with the whole cup. It should be REALLY full of water. No swallowing is allowed. This is CHEATING!. Each person in the circle gets 30 secs to try to make others laugh. Use the timer to track the time. If a person laughs and ANY water leaves their mouth, then they are out. However, people are out still get a turn (30 seconds) to make others laugh. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

One note: If you are taking your 30 seconds to make others laugh and water comes out of your mouth, you are OUT. No laughing while making others laugh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How To Win:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last person to not laugh wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;Baby If You Love Me...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make someone in the circle laugh by saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive. Little or no movement is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 or more players&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone sits in a circle. Placement doesn't matter. A player is chosen to go first. The player goes to another player in the circle that they think will laugh easily. Then they sit on their lap and say "Baby if you love me, won't you please smile?" They can play with that player's hair or whisper in their ear or act loving or anything that will get them to laugh. It all depends on the type of party and the ages of the players. If it is in a youth group or with kids or with teens that have adults around you may have to set rules on what type of touching, etc. is allowed. If it is with adults, couples, singles, or teens it all depends on what they &lt;br /&gt;

decide. You may say anything goes or you may say that no touching another player is allowed. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

After the person says "Baby if you love me won't you please smile?" the player being sat on must say "Baby I love ya but I just can't smile" without laughing or even cracking a smile. If they don't smile and say the phrase without a hitch, the person on their lap moves on to try and get somebody else. If the person being sat on does laugh it's their turn to be the person in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
