Day 1, we'll drive up to Newcomb,N.Y. and hike in six miles to Colden Dam where the lean to's and tent sites are free and first come ,first served. Once establishing our base, we have our pick of many peaks. I wish to do the 5 peaks that form the ridge of the MacIntyre Mts.,Iroqious,Boundary,Algonquin,Wrights and the Whales  Tail. Others nearby include Marcy(the highest), Skylight, Colden, Haystack and many others.&lt;br /&gt;This is bear country and food and toiletries must be hung or placed in bear proof containers.&lt;br /&gt;Water must be treated.&lt;br /&gt;Out houses and pit toilets are at the dam.&lt;br /&gt;BYOB!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>ken hodges</member_name><member_id>8561025</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283014450000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268175909000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adirondack backpacking trip</name><id>12832691</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1282561200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12832691/</event_url></item>
