For March's meetup we'll try to see Shutter Island at the Loews at the commons followed by dinner/drinks close by. It is going to be pretty warm this weekend and they will be closing the ice on March 17... Shutter Island is playing at 8 PM, so let's meet in the lobby of the movie theater to get tickets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie (~10:30) we'll head over to the Jacob Wirths pub (corner of Washington Street and Stuart Street). If you need to find us call/text me at 617-459-5145.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you RSVP so we know how many people will be joining us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the restaurant/bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew</member_name><member_id>2881088</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269214358000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266541495000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Expat Canadian March Meetup</name><id>ltbdnynfbzb</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269041400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/12643136/</event_url></item>
