&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone who wants to spend a day writing without distractions. All experience levels and all types of writing are welcome. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;But space is limited--so if you're interested, sign up now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (you can always change your RSVP later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WE'LL DO:&lt;/strong&gt; Think of this as a one-day writing retreat, during which you may work on whatever projects you wish. The studio will be available from 11 until about 6 p.m., but you may arrive and leave whenever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;--&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is this a workshop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--A:&lt;/strong&gt; No. We might start with a few writing prompts, but beyond that, we'll just write, write, write. No one will read what you've written unless you want to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we'll be in the same room, we'll be writing in companionable silence, talking only during breaks and meals. If you'd like to have a lengthy conversation with someone, you're welcome to step outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Lunch is optional, but for those interested, we'll order lunch at &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;12:30 sharp&lt;/span&gt; to prevent wasting too much time on procuring food. If you won't be onsite at 12:30, please make your own lunch arrangements (there are place with takeout nearby, if needed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the day, we can share what we've written, if people wish. Then anyone who's interested can go out for dinner, or order dinner in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/strong&gt; Located near the Holliston town center, ArtStudio 360 is air-conditioned and has free parking, plenty of tables and chairs, a restroom and a kitchenette (fridge, microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, spring water dispenser). The Studio has Wi-Fi. I will provide creative-writing books for inspiration, and an extension cord and power strip for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TO BRING:&lt;/strong&gt; Yourself, your writing projects and writing implements (computer or  writing notebook and pen). Bring your own beverage. Feel free to bring a snack to share—but that’s entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px ; text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Q:&lt;/strong&gt; May I bring an art journal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left : 30px ; text-align : left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--A:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure. But please plan to spend your time writing, or otherwise working quietly in your journal, rather than doing anything that might be distracting to other participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST:&lt;/strong&gt; $10 (cash or check), regardless of how long you stay. This fee helps keep ArtStudio 360 open. If this is a hardship, just let me know and we'll work something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/strong&gt; Reserve a place by RSVP-ing "yes" using Meetup's RSVP function. If your plans (or your guests' plans) change, PLEASE update your RSVP accordingly so that your space becomes available to someone else. Please do this right up to the start time of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCELLATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; In the unlikely event that we need to cancel---or even if we're just getting a late start--we'll post a message on the Web site and e-mail everyone who's RSVP'd "yes." &lt;em&gt;So please check the Web site and your inbox before departing for ArtStudio 360.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW POLICY REGARDING RSVPs:&lt;/strong&gt; Your RSVP is a reservation, and we're trusting that you'll honor it. If you can't make it, please change your RSVP from "yes" to "no" before the event start time. If this event is full, we reserve the right to ask people who RSVP "yes" but then don't show up--thus preventing someone else from attending--to pay the $10 fee anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come up stairs to second floor (unfortunately, no elevator)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344625723000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1339263260000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WordStudio 360: Time and space to write</name><id>68456682</id><duration>25200000</duration><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344178800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/68456682/</event_url></item>
