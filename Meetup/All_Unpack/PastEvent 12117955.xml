Whatever your pleasure, you will find it up here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downhill and Cross-Country Skiing, snowshoeing, hiking and ice-skating are just minutes outside our door and there are lots of bargains to be had at the shopping outlets of North Conway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private events are scheduled throughout the weekend to celebrate the new year and kick-off the ski season.  Contact us for more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lodging is just $20/night for guests and other optional activities are additional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Colleen</member_name><member_id>8452447</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ini Tomeu</member_name><member_id>9009943</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262477610000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Innitous</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Innitou-Ski-Runners-Activities-Club-of-New-England</urlname><id>1324713</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Innitou Ski Runners &amp; Rider's Activities Club of New England</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261271618000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spend New Year's Weekend With the Innitou Ski Runners</name><id>12117955</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262304000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Innitou-Ski-Runners-Activities-Club-of-New-England/events/12117955/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/4/6/global_6373862.jpeg</photo_url></item>
