Film Exhibit: 7pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FADO, the most traditional Portuguese music genre, was added to UNESCO’s list of World’s Intangible Cultural Heritage by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these 40 photographs you will be taken on a journey, deep rooted in Lisbon history, where Fado and the city grew “hand-in-hand”. The characters shown are ordinary people, who were photographed in action, whose feelings are outstandingly revealed in Pavão´s photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie to be shown afterwards, “Fados” directed by the consecrated Carlos Saura (2007), is a collection of performance pieces of Fado songs. They come together to give an idea of the musical style that reflects the history of the people of Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us celebrating this wonderful genre of song, the fado&lt;/p&gt;
