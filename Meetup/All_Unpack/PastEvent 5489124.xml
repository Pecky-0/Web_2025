This is a tentative date for the meeting, but most probably, it won't change.  I'm sending out the note now so people can plan ahead.  If you have a topic of interest, or better, if you'd like to drive the discussion, please let me know!  The group works best when everybody contributes their technical expertise, and I know that there is a wide range of experience in the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking isn't the greatest.  If you can't find a spot in the lot, head back toward the traffic light and take an immediate right after the gas station (if you pass the traffic light, you've gone too far!).  This puts you in the parking lot near The Traveling Rhino store.  Turn hard right in that parking lot and park near Center Sports (it is well lit there).  There are stairs that will take you up the The Java Room parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya later,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andy Stewart</member_name><member_id>3117855</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175296005000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Linux Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>linux-393</urlname><id>304994</id><group_lat>42.6199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3600006104</group_lon><name>The Chelmsford Linux Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171728387000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Linux @ The Java Room</name><id>5489124</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175122800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/linux-393/events/5489124/</event_url></item>
