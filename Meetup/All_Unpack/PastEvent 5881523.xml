Further to the east on the lake is a beach area that would be an excellent place to sit on the sand to eat some snacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: &lt;br /&gt;Rte 384 East to Bolton Notch &lt;br /&gt;Continue on Rte 44 E (left part of fork) rte 6 is to the right, stay on 44&lt;br /&gt;There is a traffic light with a post office and a small shopping area to the right, continue to the next light. &lt;br /&gt;The next light has the boat launch to the left and a church to the right. (across from South Road)&lt;br /&gt;Enter the boat launch area. &lt;br /&gt;I carry my kayak on a old sailboat trailer so im easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mapquest, GPS and others use 1,000 Boston Turnpike (rte 44) Bolton to get you close enough..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Entertainment CT .com  VIP Club</member_name><member_id>5041325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182121559000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Connecticut Arts - Theatre Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CT-Theatre-Group</urlname><id>326612</id><group_lat>41.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5599975586</group_lon><name>Connecticut Theatre Group Arts-Theater Events Group Discount</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181619467000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Evening Kayak event on Bolton Lake, Bolton CT</name><id>5881523</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181948400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CT-Theatre-Group/events/5881523/</event_url></item>
