&lt;p&gt;So let's walk, and walk some more! This week &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2) trips back and forth along the regular river path before EVEN THINKING about dinner plans! Okay, okay, calm down! I know what some of you are thinking; &lt;em&gt;two trips, what's he nuts, that's 4 miles!&lt;/em&gt; Well, think what you may, but some of us need to get ready for the skiing/riding, snowshoeing, and skating season, and legs become kinda important! Also ladies, bathing suit season will be here before you know it.......okay us guys too. So anyway, we're gona pick it up a bit. HEY, haven't you noticed, we're starting to get soooo lazy, forgetful, and just down right strange. I believe this is because of our "&lt;em&gt;after walk dinners&lt;/em&gt;" taking their toll. Just look at these facts;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...forget to register our car and get it towed while at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...think that the group's weird, spontaneous, adventures only happen because their not there. Oh, like you're the catalyst for keeping everything in check!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...are so anxious to eat, get stopped for speeding on the way to our dinner venue. Lucky 4 U it was a special day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...forget where we left our car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...come up with excuses not to walk, but will say; "... &lt;em&gt;but I think I can make it to dinner&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...say; "&lt;em&gt;lets hurry up and get this walk out of the way so we can eat&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...forget that we didn't bring a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...forget to RSVP, just show up from out of the dark and scare the &lt;strong&gt;*@%#&lt;/strong&gt; out of the rest of us.....repeatedly!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...show up for one, two, or maybe three walks, and become, well I don't know, scared of us(?), and never come back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...forget to bring their violin to play Irish songs while we walk. hint, hint!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...RSVP "&lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;", then RSVP "&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;", then forget and just show up anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...(&lt;em&gt;Oh this is a good one&lt;/em&gt;) RSVP "&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;" then RSVP "&lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;", forget to show up and then click everyone's "&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good to See You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;" button when asked to rate the walk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOW, talk about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;crazzzzy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I think we just may take the cake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now people, let's trrrrry real hard to get focused on our original goals. Does anyone remember what they were from our first walk? Are any of you "&lt;em&gt;regulars&lt;/em&gt;" even reading this? Okay than, the question of the week is; Who invented Ice Cream, in what country, and when? Let's see who's really reading this stuff and not just glancing at the title from the app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you Monday @ 5:30. That's if you don't forget to bring yourself! If you want, and you do remember whatever it was that you didn't forget, bring your best friend too! ;{&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
