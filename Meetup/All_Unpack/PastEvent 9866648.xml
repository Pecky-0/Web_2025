This will be the third time we'll be heading to Blu. People seem to really like it. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We'll be reserving the large booth/table overlooking the Paramount Theatre. Very comfortable and great for group conversations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blu originally was the private restaurant for the Sports Club members and The Ritz Carlton residence and hotel.  For a while now it's been open to the public but it's somewhat hidden so it's never crowded. This is why prices are so reasonable/moderate. Not only do I appreciate the venue for it's food and service, the bar and dining room have large 30 foot high windows that have an unobstructed view overlooking Washington Street and downtown.           &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's share a few bottles of wine or have a few drinks and maybe some tapas/dinner .... if that's what you want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME: &lt;br /&gt;7:00PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLACE:&lt;br /&gt;Blu Restaurant &lt;br /&gt;4 Avery St., 4th Floor (The LA Sports Club Entrance)&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02111&lt;br /&gt;(617) 375-8550&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you at Blu for some wine/drinks and maybe something to eat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Mike</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241059395000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236050033000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Some Wine/drinks &amp; maybe dinner at Blu </name><id>9866648</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240441200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9866648/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/5/global_7605269.jpeg</photo_url></item>
