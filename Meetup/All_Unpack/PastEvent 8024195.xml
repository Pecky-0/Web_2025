Maybe we'll even see the famous pothole on the corner of Sullivan Avenue and Elliot Street that was caused by the spinning bolder for many many years at the base of a now defunct waterfall.  We'll end up at Newton Upper Falls' very own gastropub, the Biltmore.  (Make sure to try its deep fried macaroni and cheese crouquets...highly recommended!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215102900000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Great neighborhood pub, great company, beautiful surroundings for a Sunday walk.</why><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211941901000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Stroll for Singles: Newton Upper Falls</name><id>8024195</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214753400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/8024195/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/b/global_3153499.jpeg</photo_url></item>
