Come meet the up with the rest of the Things to Do Boston members and enjoy some food and drink-FREE APPETIZERS for the first hour! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For centuries a major part of the Irish culture and community has been the Publik House. Every town in Ireland has their own pub, a meeting place in which members of the community can gather to relax, celebrate, and bond over a pint or a song. For over a century the city of Boston has been rich with Irish tradition and heritage. And many the many Irish ideas that immigrated their way across the Atlantic, the idea of the Pub was not left behind. Lansdowne Street has for decades been one of Boston's most popular destination - from the Red Sox to concerts and bars, the street had almost everything you could ask for. Now there is an Irish Pub on Landsdowne Street that brings the two traditions together and we are holding a mixer there to let our members get to know each other a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the Irish culture and Boston heritage with a little Lansdowne Street flair. A place where the community can come together to celebrate and relax. Enjoy amazing traditional Irish fare, a pint of cold beer, and the type of atmosphere that will keep you coming back for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP to events@thingstodoboston.com&lt;br /&gt;Food will be served for the first hour, so come early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Attire: Business Casual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Google Maps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=lansdowne+pub+boston&amp;amp;vps=2&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=57.902911,106.962891&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;mpnum=8&amp;amp;hq=lansdowne%20pub&amp;amp;hnear=Boston,%20MA" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Leah</member_name><member_id>8965438</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>26</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258763694000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1382</urlname><id>1275022</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Things To Do: BOSTON</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256062131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Member Mixer</name><id>11670561</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258590600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1382/events/11670561/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/9/global_5450809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
