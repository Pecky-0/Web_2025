<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This restaurant services traditional Portuguese &amp;quot;peasant&amp;quot; food.  Their specialty is grilled chicken cooked over an open flame.         &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They serve large portions at a very reasonable price.  Parking might be a challenge, because although they have a small lot in the back, it's usually full.  Street parking is also available.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us will be coming from the rock climbing event, but please feel free to join us just for dinner.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've set the RSVP deadline to March 6th, so that I can reserve a table for us.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's a very small place, you won't be able to miss us.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1237570428000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234450256000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portuguese Grill</name><id>9727930</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1236463200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/9727930/</event_url></item>
