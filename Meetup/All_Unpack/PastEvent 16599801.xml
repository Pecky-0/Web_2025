(Thanks Lyndsay for alerting us...) I'm really sorry for the 11th hour change, but let's try to meet at the Starbucks right down the street today. We can head to the library or something if it's too crowded maybe. There shouldn't be too many of us, so hopefully we can squeeze in somewhere. Give me a call if you show up late and can't find us. Sorry again! -Jess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring a work in progress and spend an hour or two writing with other writers.  Take the opportunity to discuss new ideas, encourage each other to meet self set goals, share websites and resources... Or just focus on your writing and see how much you can get done with a little dedicated time.  BackBay Borders on 511 Boylston St., Boston &lt;a href="http://www.borders.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.borders.com&lt;/a&gt; The cafe is upstairs, we will try to confiscate a table to sit around. I'm Jess. (423 863 4344) There are power outlets and free internet. Send me a message if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jess</member_name><member_id>9894327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298506988000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297953438000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Writing: LOCATION CHANGE</name><id>16599801</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298502900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/16599801/</event_url></item>
