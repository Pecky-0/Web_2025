They seem worse in my yard than over at Whitehall.  If you plan to spend a lot of time outdoors this time of year, those bug nets that go over your hat are inexpensive and can fit into a pocket.  If you always bring it you can almost be guaranteed you won't be see a bug ;-)  You can buy them locally at places like EMS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: Do not program "Whitehall State Park" into your GPS.  The parking for the boat launch is on Route 135 between Hopkinton and Westborough Centers.  The nearest Road to the launch is Dale Road in Hopkinton.&lt;/p&gt;
