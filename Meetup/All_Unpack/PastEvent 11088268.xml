We should go in and find seats at 7:30.   The film start time is 7:45.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.  If the movie is playing upstairs, I will be waiting at a table near the escalators by the windows upstairs.  If the movie is downstairs I will be near the ropes by the concession stand.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss the group, before the movie, we will gather just outside the room where we see the movie for a bit to discuss the movie and where to go after, for those who are interested in bevies and munchies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the movie is &amp;quot;9&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studio: Focus Features&lt;br /&gt;Director: Shane Acker&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter: Pamela Pettler&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Elijah Wood, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, Christopher Plummer, John C.

Visionary filmmakers Tim Burton (&amp;quot;The Corpse Bride,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&amp;quot;) and Timur Bekmambetov (&amp;quot;Wanted,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Nightwatch&amp;quot;) join forces to produce wunderkind director Shane Acker's distinctively original and thrilling tale. &amp;quot;9&amp;quot; stars Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, Christopher Plummer and Crispin Glover and features the music of Danny Elfman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 9 (&amp;quot;The Lord of the Ring's&amp;quot; Elijah Wood) first comes to life, he finds himself in a post-apocalyptic world. All humans are gone, and it is only by chance that he discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction. Despite being the neophyte of the group, 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them no good. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the first place. As they'll soon come to learn, the very future of civilization may depend on them.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Boston Movie Group Badge.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>19</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253874612000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250020650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>9</name><id>11088268</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252797300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/11088268/</event_url></item>
