Read on for details about what's included, what to bring, costs, etc. And please RSVP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't know AE, you're in for a treat. For anybody into paper arts, rubber-stamping, scrapbooking or collage/assemblage, it's worth a trip from anywhere. Visit the Web site for a sampling and video tour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no instructional agenda for this session. If individual participants volunteer to demonstrate particular techniques (as we did at our first meeting), great! If not, we'll just create cards to our hearts' content, then share and trade what we've made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS--DETAILS--DETAILS--DETAILS--DETAILS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date: Saturday, July 14, 2007&lt;br /&gt;Time: 1:30-5 p.m. (clean-up and swap starts at 4)&lt;br /&gt;Place: Absolutely Everything, 30 Main Street, Topsfield, MA 01983&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Easy to find.

If you'd like this option, just let me know when you RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;      --- Also completely optional: I pay a quarterly fee to Meetup.com for our online meeting space, mailing list, etc. If you'd like to help defray my costs, feel free to make a small donation when we meet; if not, that's completely fine, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a Stamp Camp at AE that morning before our session, which I may attend. If you'd like to do the same, see the Web site for details and call the store to register. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that's it! I'll send reminders closer to the date. Meanwhile, please do RSVP. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep creating,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185040262000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182180341000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New England ATC Group Summer Session &amp; Swap</name><id>5904450</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184434200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/5904450/</event_url></item>
