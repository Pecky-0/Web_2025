The presentations will discuss the misconduct against Soni Sori, the role of the Indian government, and the details of the Justice Verma Committee report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is organized by WRise. Moved by the recent Delhi rape crisis, a group of us decided to get together to start a Women's Initiative, WRise. This new initiative is led by women and consists of women who currently reside in the Boston area. In this initiative, we hope to discuss universal issues that affect women and to create a platform where women can freely engage in open dialogues to voice their concerns about issues that affect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get involved with WRise, please contact us at wriseboston@gmail.com. For more information about Soni Sori, see &lt;a href="http://sonisori.wordpress.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://sonisori.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
