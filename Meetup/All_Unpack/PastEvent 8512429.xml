<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hopefully we will have some good weather for this walk and can get a swim in, too!&lt;br /&gt;Plum Island is an island next to Newburyport on the North Shore.  The island includes a town on one half, and a nature reservation on the other called the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge.   We will meet at 10:00 am in the first parking lot inside the pay-gate to the refuge (its $5 to enter reservation per car).  Pay to enter, then go to the first parking lot to meet everyone. We will then drive several miles down a dirt road, and park at parking lot 6.   The walk will begin there.  We will walk along the beach around the tip of the island (going south), and then return.  I did this last year, and it was a beautiful beach walk-the tip of the island is really cool with pools of water and rocks and a view of Crane's beach.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Afterwords, we will then have dinner at the Grog in Newburport, which is a fun restaurant/bar with seafood and other food.  Carpooling strongly encouraged.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest bringing bug repellant (for flies, mosquitos in the evening).  Bring a bathing suit etc. if you want to swim after the walk.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the group walk, if we have time, and people want to wander around on their own for a bit,  that's fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link with some details on Plum Island and the reservation: &lt;a href="http://www.plum-island.com/description.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.plum-islan...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to a map of the reservation.  &lt;a href="http://www.fws.gov/northeast/parkerriver/map.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.fws.gov/no...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions from Boston to the refuge gatehouse: Distances approximate: the refuge is located 35 miles (56.3 kilometers) north of Boston near the City of Newburyport.
