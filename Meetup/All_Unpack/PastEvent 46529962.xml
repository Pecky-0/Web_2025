Once you hit Holden (if you walk that far), you'd have to turn back, for dogs aren't allowed on the Holden side. Dirt surface, wooded area, walking trails...very nice. On the weekends there are tons of dogs! There might be bikers as well, so keep that in mind. Plenty of Parking in nearby lot. Near Reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327170225000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Responsible Bully Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nebbc1</urlname><id>1356904</id><group_lat>42.2200012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>New England Bully Breed Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1325635277000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mass Central Rail Trail Dog Walk</name><id>46529962</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327165200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nebbc1/events/46529962/</event_url></item>
