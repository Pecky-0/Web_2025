Let the universal principles and ancient traditions be your guide! &lt;br /&gt;Many of us have had days when it is simply hard to get up in the morning - our fear, anxiety and negative thoughts seem worse for some unknown reasons. It may be perplexing for some of you, as to why you get swayed by your emotions so easily upon arising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to you has a deeper reason and a simple explanation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it due to lack of commitment on your part? Not necessarily. Here is why. Many of us are simply not reconnected fully with our physical bodies in the morning. Did you know that? When was the last time you questioned how energetically present you are when you just wake up? The chances are you never did, because like most people, you take for granted that it will just happen on its own, without any conscious effort on your part. A groggy feeling? – it gets taken care of by a morning shower and a cup of coffee – then something changes in how present you feel, there is a sense that you finally “woke up”!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many traditions it is believed that some part of your soul’s energy leaves your body during sleep at night. This creates energetic displacement. In the morning, the body is confused by this natural rhythm of integration and registers it as anxiety triggered energetic displacement. This simple fact is mostly unknown. The ancients knew that to reawaken the soul’s ability to fully embody, your energy must come back through the top of your head all the way down to your fingertips and your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many traditions it is believed that some part of your soul’s energy leaves your body during sleep at night.

The ancients knew that to reawaken the soul’s ability to fully embody, your energy must come back through the top of your head all the way down to your fingertips and your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explore teachings and practices from the heart of Kabbalistic mystical wisdom. &lt;br /&gt;Guided by an ancient prayers that are said first thing in the morning and by detailed soul energy integrations diagrams, come and learn the new practices that cultivate your energetic connection to your physical body. You will find how these simple tools are sufficient to generate a tranquil state of balance, deep seeing, awareness, peace and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening will be followed by an all day workshop on [&lt;b&gt;i]Saturday, Nov 7 - Energetic Boundaries: Healing Without Effort&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, where you will learn about your soul as an individualized aspect of creation and your energetic boundary as protective container. Only during this workshop you can come to experience your energetic boundary as your personal abode that keeps you safe, protected and impervious to outside influences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing can exist without having and edge or a membrane. We are all being an intrinsic part of quantum field. But, even within the quantum field, there is still individual signature created by the unique resonance of you own energetic boundary. Your experience of your life is reflection of that resonance. When your boundary is integrated and fully occupied – that is when you have your own unique signature and you cannot lose yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the course of this workshop through a series of practice sessions using the ancient principles of energy field ownership and reclamation you will learn to expand and transform yourself into a vessel for powerful healing transformation and manifestation.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yuliya Cohen</member_name><member_id>6311859</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258340842000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People on a healing journey</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma</urlname><id>1373363</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Freedom from Fear/ Anxiety /Emotional Trauma Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256950238000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wake up to healing!
