Much like the Spartan runs but not as tough and is more fun spirited. Even if you think you cannot run, it will be fun to try. You can walk, crawl or we can carry you :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already 6 members from the Asian Professional Rhode Island Group attending. Depending on the number of people that go, we will have to coordinate car pool and times. It is early morning, so if members want to stay over on Saturday night rather than drive Sunday morning, that is also an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up for the 10:30am start time and our team name is "APRI". We will need to leave Providence/Boston around 7am to be there an hour before our start time. It will be fun to just try and we will all finish!!!&lt;/p&gt;
