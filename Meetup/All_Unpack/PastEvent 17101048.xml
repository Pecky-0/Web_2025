And due to some unforeseen circumstances, Ben is now agreeing to open his house for it as mine is not quite ready for game day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would like anyone who RSVPs to please have a name and pic up, otherwise I will remove you from the RSVP&amp;nbsp; (we have over 600 members and a lot of repeated names, so I want to make sure i know which person it is)&amp;nbsp; Shiny, you are an exception.&amp;nbsp; I know where you live. i will send an email with my address prior to the event to the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
