Ensuring clean water is one of the world's most pressing environmental concerns. Researchers in the emerging field of nanotechnology are exploring ways that super-small devices can provide clean water to millions, clean up contaminated brownfield sites more economically, and help meet the globe's increasing demand for low-cost, renewable energy.This forum invites you to investigate how these new technologies may carry with them a degree of uncertainty and environmental risk. For instance, did you know that consumer products containing nanosilver and carbon nanotubes are currently unregulated? Speakers: Chad Vecitas Assistant Professor of Environmental Engineering, Harvard, and Karine Thate, Strategic Projects, MoS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ten free tickets - first come, first served - but anyone else who wants to come can purchase tickets at the link below:&lt;br /&gt;www.mos.org/innovatorsrsvp &lt;br /&gt;tickets $50 (includes dinner and drinks) Casual business attire.
