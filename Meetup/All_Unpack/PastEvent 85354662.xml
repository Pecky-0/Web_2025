Fear not! The Boston University has extended an offer to the Canadian group to attend a game this Sunday free of charge. This is an excellent family friendly venue and the game between the University of Toronto and Boston University will take place at Agannis Arena at 1 P.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must RSVP by Friday at 5 PM to get your name on the guest list. You must also provide full name of everyone in your party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're invited to stay after the game to celebrate the start of the season and enjoy some fun entertainment and games, open skate* and team autograph session!  (That’s the BU team, not Toronto!) *Hockey and figure skates are available for free or bring your own. (Quantities and sizes of skates are limited.  Sizes range from youth 8 to adult 13.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT PARKING INFORMATION &lt;br /&gt;
