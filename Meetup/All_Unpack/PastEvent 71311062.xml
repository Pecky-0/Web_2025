&lt;p&gt;The event includes a presentation about the program given by the founder, and a photo display of the program and some of the African sights in and around where the students live.  There will also be food and some prizes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a suggested donation, which can be paid at the door. You can also easily pay online by going to the eventbrite site. Which is looking pretty awesome if I do say so myself...so check it out. Please let me know if you have any questions. I would love to have a huge nerd presence there!&lt;/p&gt;
