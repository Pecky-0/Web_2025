Come for part or all. Once again, I'll set up the tent, fire up the grill and offer some Amsoil, tools, and other stuff needed to get your scoots ready for the season. Come and do some work, help someone else do some work, just eat a burger or two, or just hang out. I might be doing a heated grip install on my Reflex.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really more of an FYI than a GBSC event, RSVP if you want to let other members know that you will be there , otherwise just show up whenever or not at all. I think this will be one event that no scooter rider will want to miss.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Address is 377 South Bolton Rd in Bolton

Directions are here:  http://home.comcast.net/%7Ecsiano/direction.htm
