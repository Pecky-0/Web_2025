So join us, won't you, at the seating area outside Boston Burger Company and JP Licks in Davis Square, right across from both T entrances. We can do some of our tried and true exercises or even draw some inspiration from folks who pass! Keep in mind there won't be any electricity, so we may have to revert to the good old-fashioned pen and paper for this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't worry, we'll have another fried pickle event soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's the area with tables and chairs right across from both T stops and outside the Boston Burger Company and JP Licks.
