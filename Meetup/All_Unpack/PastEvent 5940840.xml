I could feel inside me a place of&lt;br /&gt;peace and inner wisdom that was accessible through meditation&lt;br /&gt;and the practice of yoga.&lt;br /&gt;What made the most sense to me was that God, light, peace, joy,&lt;br /&gt;happiness, love, and centeredness was on the inside. I could feel&lt;br /&gt;it in a way that was tangible, especially in sivasana/relaxation. I&lt;br /&gt;want to share with you my personal story of becoming a Christian&lt;br /&gt;priest and my experiences of finding inner peace and the God&lt;br /&gt;Self without having to move to India. The purpose of yoga and&lt;br /&gt;meditation is to maintain a state of balance, harmony and love on&lt;br /&gt;and off the mat.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1183937531000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1182913056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yoga and the Christ</name><id>5940840</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183764600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/5940840/</event_url></item>
