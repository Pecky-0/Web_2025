<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Terminator Salvation starts at 4:20, so I was thinking we should meet at 4:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of the first two Terminators, and have been waiting a long time for a Terminator movie that takes place in the Future.  I especially love the future scene where the T-100 is crushing the human skulls under its feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is supposed to have a lot of action and explosions.  I hope it lives up to the Cameron Terminators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie we will be going to The Otherside Cafe. &lt;br /&gt;We should get there around 7:00 after the movie.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is located at 407 Newbury Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest way to get there is take the green line to Hynes Convention Center, get on Newbury St, and walk across Mass Ave.  It is on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have 14 beers on draft.
