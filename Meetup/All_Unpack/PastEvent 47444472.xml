The Doc will be sipping some fermented beverages at The Point Tavern (formally Abe's) from 20:00 to 21:00. After that he'll be migrating towards the Jewelry District to be at the Art Bar (171 Chestnut Street) by 23:00 (to ensure free entry to anyone who wants to stay there and dance). Of course, that is a long stroll, so the Doc will make frequent stops into any place with more beverages on tap to regenerate his energy. If you plan to come along and share some cheer with the Doc, please plan ahead for a ride, or taxi at the nite&amp;#146;s end. -Unless of course you shape change on Friday the 13th and can sprint, leap, gallop, fly or howl your way home.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doc LateNite</member_name><member_id>9585499</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326758457000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326165922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Doc's warm winter stroll with cheer on a Friday the 13th</name><id>47444472</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326502800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/47444472/</event_url></item>
