I've been working with  Rick Bianco, ACE Certified,   for personal training for the past fives years and so love showing everyone  my results.  I asked him if he'd be open to show a small group of  ladies the basics of weights and toning and how they can be of benefit.  He agreed to open his shop to  8 us at 78 Olympia Ave in Woburn to show up how to use weights, the best way to stretch, and realistic expectation and health results from weights training.  So, join us!  RSVP only if you are certain to attend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7792036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255358265000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253901098000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Women's Weight Training - How Do You Begin-New Day and Time</name><id>11465487</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255185000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/11465487/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/7/global_10454295.jpeg</photo_url></item>
