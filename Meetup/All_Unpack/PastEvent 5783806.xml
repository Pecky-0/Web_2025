The taste factor?The average item on your dinner plate travels over 1500 miles before it reaches the consumer. On the route to the supermarket, which can take as many as fourteen days, many valuable nutrients are lost (plus your food is often made appealing through artificial means, including gassing and dyeing). Food purchased at a farmers' market is usually picked the same day, a difference your taste buds will appreciate! At our markets, all of the farm products sold are from CT farms and travel no more than 55 miles, meaning you get real flavors straight from the source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric will be your contact for this event...860.214-9361. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179752701000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179319241000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Haven Farmers' Market Opening Day! 9-1p.</name><id>5783806</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179579600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5783806/</event_url></item>
