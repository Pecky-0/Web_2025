The Citizen Wine Bar is one of the Niche Hospitality Restaurants that also own Bocado, Mezcal and The Jewel Box and they have a fun little menu with delicious food and great wine and beer. They also have the best chocolate mousse that I have ever tasted and a fun intimate atmosphere. Check it out at www.thecitizenwinebar.com. We will meet there at 6:30. Just ask for Sue and I will make sure the staff knows where to direct you. I am looking forward to meeting you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279383743000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277745435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at The Citizen Wine Bar in Exchange Place in Worcester</name><id>lrfxnynkbtb</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279233000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/13936779/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/6/global_16135222.jpeg</photo_url></item>
