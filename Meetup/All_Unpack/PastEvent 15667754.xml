These events provide a way for people to talk about inspiring movies on a deeper level and how they affect our lives, our attitudes, our perceptions. Itâ€™s also a great opportunity to meet like-minded people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In December we will be featuring Beyond Belief:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two strangers, Patti Quigley and Susan Retik, formed a common bond in their grief when both lost their husbands on Sept. 11, 2001. This documentary chronicles how the two coped with their unimaginable loss, traveling to Afghanistan to meet women there who were also widowed by violence. Director Beth Murphy follows Quigley and Retik as they discover that they share a kinship with their Middle Eastern counterparts, even though they're worlds apart.&lt;br /&gt;Our December Conscious Movie supports  &lt;br /&gt;Beyond the 11th &lt;br /&gt;to support widows and their families in Afghanistan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292170611000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291739821000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Meetup for December - Beyond Belief</name><id>15667754</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292112000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/15667754/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/f/4/global_20105620.jpeg</photo_url></item>
