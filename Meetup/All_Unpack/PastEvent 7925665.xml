The plan is essentially the same.  If it turns out to be rainy on Saturday, we will hike on Saturday the 21st instead, same time, same place!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owl's Head! We leave at 7:30 am from the Lincoln Woods Visitor's Center. Only 10 hikers in 1 group are allowed in a designated wilderness area. The round trip is 18 miles, 2,850 feet, completed in a book time of 10:25. If the group wishes to shorten the hike to 14 miles we can bushwhack in the open hardwood forest on the way in &amp;amp; on the way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike can be matched up with the Franconia Falls hike and camping option. These details are still being worked out, but this is a good time to camp out the night before the early hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your response/signing up for a hike certifies that you have read, understand, and agree with the NEHAAG disclaimer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hiker profile is complete so we can verify that your qualified to join us on this White Mountain hike.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Light green Subaru Outback with Bike Rack on back</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bara</member_name><member_id>3491697</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1213616464000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>It'll be fun to do it as a team.
