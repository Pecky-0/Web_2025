As part of its worldwide tour, it will play November 14, 2009 at 3:00 PM and 8:00 PM in TD Garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information and video, visit www.StarWarsInConcert.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated live by Anthony Daniels (the actor who portrayed C-3PO in all six films), the production features a full symphony orchestra and choir, accompanied by specially edited footage from the films displayed on a three-story-tall, high-definition LED super-screen - one of the largest ever put on tour. The live music and film elements are synchronized in order to create a full multi-media, one-of-kind Star Wars experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanying the concert is an exclusive exhibit of Star Wars costumes, props, artifacts, production artwork and specially created behind-the-scenes videos from the Lucasfilm Archives. Many of these pieces are leaving Skywalker Ranch for the first time. The exhibit features many classic fan favorite artifacts, as well as several new and never-before-seen items, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Full costumes for Jedi Masters Kit Fisto and Plo Koon will be on display.&lt;br /&gt;    * For the first time ever, pages from John Williams' original hand-written sheet music for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace will be exhibited for the public.&lt;br /&gt;    * Also on display will be various never-before-seen props from the films, including blasters and helmets from Coruscant, Tatooine and other iconic Star Wars locations.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signage. possible food before (Porters Bar and Grill?). stay tuned.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>74173</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>3</waitlist_count><updated>1258417336000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257607131000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>STAR WARS IN CONCERT</name><id>11818532</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258244100000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11818532/</event_url></item>
