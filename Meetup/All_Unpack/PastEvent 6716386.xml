<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We held our first meetup group inside for November because the weather was pretty chilly that day!  The indoor space was great, and there was definitely enough room for everyone to run around.  We played fetch and the dogs had a great time!  Even shy Daisy played for a little - she is coming out of her shell!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with a friendly, playful pooch is welcome to join us for Decembers meetup.  It will probably be held inside again due to the weather!  Winter is upon us!  I hope to see you all there!  Please email me with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mirya&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197915141000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>activedogs-159</urlname><id>565327</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194721639000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Dogs December Meetup</name><id>6716386</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1197741600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/activedogs-159/events/6716386/</event_url></item>
