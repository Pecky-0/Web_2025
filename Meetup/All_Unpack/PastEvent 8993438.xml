<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Same deal as before. Let me or Greg know if we're over RSVP quota and you want to come with a small instrument. I may not be there as I am traveling this month, but I hope you all have a nice full session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, bring charts if you want to stray from the real book. Bassists and drummers are essential for these things, so if any b's or d's sees we don't have one, please try to help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have been very fun sessions in the past. Have a good time!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call Greg at number listed here; door is usually open.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed</member_name><member_id>7538494</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226882342000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Jazz Fans/Musicians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>jazz-190</urlname><id>1202977</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Cambridge/Somerville/Boston Jazz Meetup/Jam</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224472701000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Jam at Greg's</name><id>8993438</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1225060200000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/jazz-190/events/8993438/</event_url></item>
