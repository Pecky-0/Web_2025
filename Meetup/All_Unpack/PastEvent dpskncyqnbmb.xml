&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;This novel was a finalist for the &lt;strong&gt;Pulitzer&lt;/strong&gt; and a finalist for &lt;strong&gt;The National Book Circle Critics Award&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a synopsis from the publisher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone who cherishes the gift of language will cherish Diane Ackerman's narrative masterpiece, an exquisitely written love story and medical miracle story, one that combines science, inspiration, wisdom, and heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One day Ackerman's husband, Paul West, an exceptionally gifted wordsmith and intellectual, suffered a terrible stroke. When he regained awareness he was afflicted with aphasia—loss of language—and could utter only a single syllable: "mem." The standard therapies yielded little result but frustration. Diane soon found, however, that by harnessing their deep knowledge of each other and her scientific understanding of language and the brain she could guide Paul back to the world of words. This triumphant book is both a humane and revealing addition to the medical literature on stroke and aphasia and an exquisitely written love story: a magnificent addition to literature, period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a review from Publisher's Weekly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two phrasemakers and longtime married partners had to relearn a shared, intimate conversation post-stroke as Ackerman narrates in her touching latest work. Paul West, Ackerman's 75-year-old British husband (she is 18 years younger), was a retired English professor and the author of 50-plus books, survivor of diabetes and a pacemaker, when he was struck by a massive stroke that left "a small wasteland" in his brain, especially in the key language areas. For literary minds like West and Ackerman, his inability to formulate language (reduced to repeating numbly the sounds "mem, mem, mem" in anger and confusion) was a shock to them both: "o be so godlike, and yet so fragile," his wife writes in despair. Her memoir of this terrible time, first in the hospital, then at home, records the small victories in his speech making and numerous frustrating setbacks; she even took it upon herself to make up humorous but challenging exercises for him to do, Mad Libs–style. Contrary to the bleak prognosis, West gradually made progress, while their journey makes for goofy, pun-happy reading, a little like overhearing lovers coo to each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
