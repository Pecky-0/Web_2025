(look at the pic, he's crackin there! :-)  He also ran the karaoke at times when Jimmy Z wasn't around.  (I always helped him with the electronics! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://panacheband.com/"&gt;Panache&lt;/a&gt; has been around for quite a while before Ronnie graced them with his presence! ;-)  I was talking to Slakas' lead Chris and he loves their mix of music that he said was great to dance to!  And he was right!  We love to dance with this band!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haluwa has one of the bigger dance floors in the area to dance ON!  And be in the mood for chinese! (I love their Chicken Wings, Rice w/Shrimp and Combo Platters ($10!)!) Watch their Scorpion bowls, they seem to have a REAL affect! lol &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Haluwa is off exit 6w in Nashua in the Nashua Mall, just beyond Denny's &amp;amp; Radio Shack, but before&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/b/4/event_161385492.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; Shortys. We'll start at 8, music is at 9, til closing around 1!. We're usually in the center section of the club, where we can add tables as we add people thru the night! So don't be afraid to come late if you have to. We've had some big crowds there and the late comers keep us up to the end! And we have fun with other groups there too!&lt;/p&gt;
