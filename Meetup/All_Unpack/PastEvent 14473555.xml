Now you can get that fix for rolling your dice (and roleplaying your character).  For those of you who participated in season one of Encounters, your character is now fully legal in LFR.  Otherwise, please download the LFR Character Creation Guide available at &lt;a href="http://www.wizards.com/rpga/downloads/LFR_CharGenGd.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.wizards.co...&lt;/a&gt;.  We look forward to seeing you as we adventure across the world of Abeir-Toril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINI2-2 &amp;quot;Ravens Under the Midday Sun&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;The tale of Ravens Bluff continues as a new generation of heroes find themselves caught in the whirl of intrigue and menace that only the City of Adventurers can provide. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Ravens Bluff for characters levels 1-4. This is the second part of the three-part &amp;quot;Return to Ravens Bluff&amp;quot; mini-campaign. For maximum enjoyment, it is recommended (but not required) that you play the mini-campaign adventures in sequential order, using the same character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DALE1-7 &amp;quot;Arts&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Isolation can be a boon â€” but when strange events leave the members of an airborne boarding school for young nobles in High Dale ill, only aid from outside can offer a solution. Can the adventurers solve this discretely and in time?  A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in the Dalelands for characters levels 1-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note:  LFR adventures are intended to be played in 4 hours.  As the store closes at 10PM on Wednesday nights (and we very much like having a store to play in), it's imperative that LFR events begin promptly at 6PM in order to ensure sufficient time to play the adventure.  Please arrive on time (if not a little early) and be ready to start the adventure at 6PM sharp.  Please have a character pre-made as pre-generated characters will not be available.  Due to issues arising from previous sessions, if you do not come with a pre-made character you will be seated last at a table, as it's unfair to others who RSVP and are ready on time to have to wait and potentially have the adventure not finish in time before the store closes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>11344282</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283466988000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1282230841000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Living Forgotten Realms</name><id>14473555</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283377500000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/14473555/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
