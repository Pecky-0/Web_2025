(Will it ever stay warm?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June, we had a good turn out at our usual location (Starbucks on Boylston at Berkeley St.), which I appreciate since I goofed by neglecting to update this site to let everyone know where we were meeting.  Regardless, we had a good turn-out, so I thank those who assumed it would be at the usual place and showed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For July, we're going to change our meeting date to the SECOND Sunday of the month (July 9).  I'm doing this because of the Objectivist Conference being held in Boston which will conflict with our meetup if we keep in scheduled for July 2.  So... mark your calendar for July 9, 5PM, Starbucks on Boylston at Berkeley Streets.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what we'll discuss, we're going to continue discussing OPAR (Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand).  We'll focus on Chapter 2 and revisit Chapter 1, which we discussed briefly in June.  For June, we also had planned on discussing &amp;quot;Think Twice&amp;quot; from The Early Ayn Rand (a collection of unpublished fiction), but we didn't get to it, so I'm game for talking about it in July.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Don't worry if you cannot find time to read both of the suggested readings.  The point of the group is to meet other folks interested in Ayn Rand's philosophy and grow in your understanding of it.  Feel free to come with as little or as much knowledge of Ayn Rand as you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll hope to see you the SECOND Sunday of July... July 9 at 5PM in the basement of Starbucks on Boylston at Berkeley!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to pay meetup.com $19.00 per month to use their site, but for me, this is a small price to pay for the opportunity to meet other people interested in Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand.  However, if anyone would be willing to donate a dollar or two to help me defray the monthly expenditure, that would be great.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amanda</member_name><member_id>2499401</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ayn Rand Fans and Objectivists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aynrand-150</urlname><id>211108</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ayn Rand Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1149458462000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Ayn Rand July Meetup</name><id>4964272</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1152478800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aynrand-150/events/4964272/</event_url></item>
