<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The third in our series of jam sessions -- If you sing or play an instrument, we'd love to have you come and join us!  We'll likely have guitars, hand drums, keyboard and a microphone with a small amp. Rock/jazz/folk/pop standards are the usual fare.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our member Bob Trebra has graciously offered to learn any specifically requested songs and says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot; please let everyone know that if they have a song they want to sing , to please E-mail me (bob.trebra@comcast.net) with it along with the Artist's name and I will type up the Stage sheet in the key of the actual recording. (unless they give me the Key they want to sing it in) This way I can practice/learn it. I will then forward it back on an E.M attachment so they can take a copy for them selves. This way we don't spend half the time looking up songs on the Internet like last time. I will need their requests ASAP so I'm not bombarded with songs a few days b/4 we get together. :~)&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be serving nibbles and wine/beer/soft drinks as usual (and possibly some birthday cake, too!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>White colonial house in the historic district of Chaplin</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Northrop</member_name><member_id>8657197</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275227648000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272206901000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Birthday Jam Session @Victoria's</name><id>13283540</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273960800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/13283540/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_6487468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
