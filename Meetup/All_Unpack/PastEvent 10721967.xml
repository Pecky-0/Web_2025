There is no stress on those who aren't yet proficient, yet there are enough fluent and native French speakers so as not to be boring for those who speak with ease.  Those who are debutantes can speak if they want or if they feel they are not yet ready they can listen without feeling left out.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251244096000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>french-789</urlname><id>1150221</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Boston Metrowest French Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245811613000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MIDSUMMER MEETUP FOR LOVERS OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE</name><id>10721967</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248217200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/french-789/events/10721967/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/0/global_4128560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
