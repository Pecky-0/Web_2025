<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to become more active and maybe lose a few pounds in the process? Beginning just after the first of the new year, let's make that resolution come true with a proven, gradual walk to jog program that will have you running your first 5K race in just a couple of months. This meet-up's details will be updated as we get closer to New Year's, but I wanted to get this announced to see if there was enough interest to move forward.  I am working on recruiting a coach so there might be a nominal charge, but it would be no more than $25 per person for a several week long program that would get you ready for your first (or next) 5K race. &lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357659137000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289498652000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Year's Resolution: Couch to 5K</name><id>16279530</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357214400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/16279530/</event_url></item>
