<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Julia has over a decade of professional experience as an energetic healer and intuitive coach. She uses her intuitive abilities to guide people into a deeper awareness of the forces shaping their lives, and then offers concrete tools for empowerment and growth. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We will be meeting at a very comfortable location in Dedham. The address will be given to people who have a Yes RSVP a couple of days before the event. Donations are voluntary. We will be giving Julia at least $100. If you can donate at least $10 then it will make our costs lower. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Feel free to bring snacks. There will be a couch, chairs and room to lie comfortably on the floor. This will be an interesting, educational, relaxing and exciting event! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
