 RAIN SNOW CANCELS THIS EVENT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather permitting, I think it would be fun to go for a bike ride on the Windham Depot Rail Trail. Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; I thought that we would bike to Salem (3 &amp;frac12; miles) then head to Derry (6 miles) and have lunch at on East Broadway, then bike back to the&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; parking lot.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Depending on how fast we can bike the trail and how long we take for lunch, the whole event will take anywhere from 2 &amp;frac12; hours to 3 &amp;frac12; hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get back into the shape for biking!&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; This short trail (total of about 12 miles round trip) has great scenery along the way, and is now paved all the way to Derry!&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; So, come and join me for a fun time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 10:00 am at the Depot Rd parking lot in Windham, NH.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Please follow these directions. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;From route 111 take N. Lowell Rd, drive till you see Depot Rd on your right.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; Take the right and the parking is on your right about 1000 ft further on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring your sunscreen, insect repellent and lots of fluids and dress in layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; There is no need to RSVP no!&lt;/p&gt;
