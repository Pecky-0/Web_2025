&lt;p&gt;This is an ONLINE event: The first nationally televised Republican  presidential debate in the 2012 election cycle will be held on May 5,  2011. Because of this, it is imperative to showcase Ron Paul as the  leading frontrunner in the race. On May 5, 2011, we will hold an online  money bomb in support of Ron Paul for President 2012. A money bomb is a  24-hour fundraising event aimed at dramatically increasing funds for a  specific can&lt;span&gt;didate. In November 2007,  Ron Paul raised more than $4.2 million in a single day. In December  2007, Ron Paul raised the most money in the history of American politics  in a single day, raising more than $6 million; a record that still  holds strong to this very day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please invite your friends, and  tell them that it is essential that we all donate to Ron Paul on May 5,  2011, in preparation for the first nationally televised Republican  presidential debate for 2012. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The money bomb will likely be held  on Ron Paul's official campaign website, which will be linked here once  it is created. For now, please visit LibertyPAC.com, and consider making  a donation before the official money bomb. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Join the conversation at: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ronpaulforums.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.RonPaulForums.c&lt;/span&gt;om/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.DailyPaul.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You may also pledge here: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.debateday.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.DebateDay.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>shemdogg</member_name><member_id>7638748</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304689046000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302989346000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul's Debate Day Money Bomb</name><id>17329279</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304568000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/17329279/</event_url></item>
