We'll have some food court food, talk about holiday plans, discuss plans for Union activities in the new year and new member involvement, conduct our Yankee Swap book exchange, read poems aloud in a food court full of enthralled mall shoppers, and generally run amok. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find us by looking for the crowded table full of books and wrapping paper, or by calling me: 617-935-4951. This is a great chance for folks who aren't generally available to join us for a Friday night workshop, to catch up or introduce themselves around.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230947884000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226711452000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Poetry Meetup: Holiday Book Swap</name><id>9165159</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229796000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/9165159/</event_url></item>
