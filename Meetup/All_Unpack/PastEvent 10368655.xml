If you've hiked with us in the past and want a more&lt;b&gt; challenging day&lt;/b&gt;, but not too challenging, join us for this hike! We'll try one of the longer, slightly more difficult trails at Sleeping Giant, with a snack/lunch break somewhere in the middle, and good people to explore with.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at Sleeping Giant, the Connecticut State Park located in Hamden.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN:  &lt;b&gt;Please do not RSVP yes unless you a) have hiked with us before at Sleeping Giant, and b) desired a challenge that exceeds what the tower trail has to offer.&lt;/b&gt; Regarding the level of this hike: this will be a challenging, but not a &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; hike . . . but at the same time, if you tend to lag behind the group when you hike with us, then this one is not for you. (If you're not sure, email me,I'd love to help you sort it out! -Sarah)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN AND WHERE: Meet at the entrance, which is located on Mt. Carmel Avenue, between 8:45 and 9, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by five after 9. This particular hike will be 3 to &lt;b&gt;4 hours&lt;/b&gt;, including breaks, so please keep that in mind when planning the rest of your day. . . i.e., it may take 4 hours and ten minutes, so plan accordingly. . . we want to relax on the break, and keep a comfortable pace, not having to rush back.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING: At least two liters of water!, snacks and/or lunch, bandana/hanky, a backpack of some kind to carry your stuff, a sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads;  appropriate socks and layers of clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website.
