This is the cross country ski season calling you for your season opener at Great Brook Touring!!!!  Its going to be an awesome day this Saturday at Great Brook, they are opening officially for the season on Friday at noon.  The snow from yesterday gave them 7 inches, and they are going to wait until it gets frozen again tomorrow to groom it.  If for some reason the weather turns south or they say the conditions are not going to be good, I'll send out a notice on Friday night.  But as of now they are confident of great conditions for Saturday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get there in time to be ready to ski by 10:00 AM. You can be back home and doing your holiday shopping by 1:00 that afternoon, refreshed by all the sun and fresh air. Or you can keep skiing into the afternoon, bring a picnic lunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Great Brook is CASH ONLY and its cheap, $12 for a pass and $13 to rent skis/boots/poles. And a season pass is only $60!!  We'll split up into at least two or three groups, and there usually enough skiers to have a beginners, intermediate and advanced group. If we have enough people I'll skate with whoever wants to skate, or do some backcountry loops.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I'm scheduling an event for the next day, Sunday at Windblown!!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy in the Santa hat....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260812423000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260458324000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Brook Season Opener!!</name><id>12058764</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1260630000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/12058764/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
