&lt;p&gt;The Red Sox Natives have been organizing Patriots Game Watching Events over the past 2 months with&amp;nbsp;up to&amp;nbsp;50 people attending&amp;nbsp;at Boston and Woburn venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we will head to a smaller and differrent suburban venue with a Holiday twist on Sunday, December 18 at 3:30pm to watch the Patriots take on the Denver Broncos.&amp;nbsp;This could be a playoff clinching game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish your Holiday shopping at the nearby malls along Routes 1 and 128 then join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington's Food and Spirits in downtown Wakefield is a cozy Irish Restaurant and Pub with two floors. We have been there before. The food is great and the full menu will be available for purchase. Owners Lisa and Dan have offerred us a section of the first floor bar area to watch the game. They promised to turn up the volume and provide some light&amp;nbsp;treats to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrive early at 3:30pm and get yourself a prime seat and enjoy some pre-game socializing. Since&amp;nbsp;Harrington's is all Irish the Red Heads get special treatment here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game Time is 4:15pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a Holiday twist with some door prizes for lucky Red Sox Natives and guests.&amp;nbsp;You must be there before half time to be eligible. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is free parking in downtown Wakefield in the public lot across from Harrington's in front of Bank of America and along Water and Main Streets. The location is T accessible by the 136 and 137 Bus from the Orange Line in Malden Center. And Commuter Rail accessible from North Station (departs 2:45pm)&amp;nbsp;via the&amp;nbsp;Haverhill Train stopping at Wakefield Station (3:08pm) with a less than 10 minute walk up Albion&amp;nbsp;Street, right on&amp;nbsp;to Main Street and 1 block to Water Street. If you are joining us from the City this is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is responsible for their own food/drink.&amp;nbsp;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER AND TIP YOUR SERVERS!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please&amp;nbsp;RSVP early if you think you can attend. Invite, guests, friends, co-workers and Red Heads. Soon we will&amp;nbsp;invite several&amp;nbsp;other groups to join us so space may become limited. Let's have as many Natives there as possible and take over Harrington's!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following groups have been invited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield Weeknights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Happy Hour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Fun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
