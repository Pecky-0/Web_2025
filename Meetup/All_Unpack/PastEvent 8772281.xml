Last year's  festival proved to be an eye-opening experience for many of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Route 181&lt;/b&gt; is the result of Khleifi and Sivan's two-month journey from the south to the north of their country of birth. They traced their trajectory on a map and called it Route 181. This virtual line follows the borders outlined in Resolution 181, which was adopted by the United Nations on November 29, 1947 to partition Palestine into two states. As they travel along this route, they meet women and men, Israeli and Palestinian, young and old, civilians and soldiers, and film them in their everyday lives. Capturing the fragments of a land shattered by politics, history, and colonialism, &lt;b&gt;Route 181&lt;/b&gt; presents an oral history from a wide variety of people living along the 1947 partition line. By portraying both the divide of the physical landscape and that of the humans who inhabit it, the film conveys a fuller understanding of this conflicted part of the world.
