Sometimes this allows the dreamer to act with intention in the dream, such as walking, flying, speaking, or moving something hands-free with mind energy. Sometimes it allows the dreamer to control the content of the dream, such as a change of scene or making someone appear or disappear. In this Meetup we will explore these and other lucid dream experiences. In addition we will share techniques to intentionally dream lucidly. Through guided meditation we will practice the art of lucid dreaming. Bring your lucid dreams and other unusual dreams, to share, or just bring your curiosity. Come with us on these amazing and wonderful journeys! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
