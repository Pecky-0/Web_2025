We had a couple of cancellations today, but Krista and I had a great video chat! we're making great progress. During this meeting we will discuss the designer information we received in greater detail to determine the ones that will best work for our planned event. We will also take a look at planning a more definitive date for this photo shoot. This meeting will take place online...via Google+ share. You need to have a google+ account to join us. You also need to add the members to your circle and join in my hangout.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lorrie Pearson</member_name><member_id>2115352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332256236000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>beauty, fashion, photo stylists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-beauty-fashion-and-photo-stylist</urlname><id>1460783</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Beauty, Fashion and Photo Stylist</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1331596781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>6th planning meeting for designer collection event</name><id>56098332</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332199800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-beauty-fashion-and-photo-stylist/events/56098332/</event_url></item>
