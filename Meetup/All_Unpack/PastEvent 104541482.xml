We will meet at Sandyâ€™s Restaurant, within the main parking lot for Long Beach, and then carpool in 4-WD vehicles to the Goldenrod Field Station located just north of the crossover on Ryder Way. From there it's a 2.5 - 3 mile round trip around the end of Long Beach and afterwards we can relax at the field station. The tide should allow for this unless we get a storm, in which case we'll have to postpone. When replying, please note if you can bring a 4-WD vehicle, so we can make sure everyone has a ride. Limited to 12 people&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorie</member_name><member_id>8662901</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361891680000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360812299000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Full Moon Hike at the North End of Plymouth Long Beach</name><id>104541482</id><headcount>9</headcount><duration>7200000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361835000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/104541482/</event_url></item>
