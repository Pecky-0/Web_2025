Also, photos with Santa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is a locally-made independent comedy feature film, &lt;a href="http://www.burialboys.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;Burial Boys&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (with new, added scenes), that I have a small but memorable role in (I'm a flamboyant, perverted, gay makeup artist).  See photo for a look.  A new short film from the same filmmakers will also be shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7pm &amp;quot;red carpet&amp;quot; actors coming.  8pm film.  Afterwards dancing at the club (&lt;a href="http://www.terminal110.com/peppers/" target="_blank"&gt;Sargent Peppers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10.  Although the last 2 showings (Wallingford, &amp;amp; Hartford) sold-out, they say this place is big enough, it won't sell out.  Tickets available &lt;a href="http://burialboys.ticketleap.com/burial-boys-new-haven-screening/" target="_blank"&gt;in advance&lt;/a&gt; or at the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be drink specials.  Apparently food sold too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's OK to RSVP &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot;, but Meetup has removed that option, so just put a note in your &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;.  (annoyed?  Me too.  Complain &lt;a href="http://meetupblog.meetup.com/2010/12/no-more-maybe.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/help/contactus/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRAILER:&lt;/b&gt; (unrated, NSFW) &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UUxjr8e0Rc"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; (the film is rated R)&lt;br /&gt;The film is a low-budget, loose, goofy, over-the-top indie dark comedy. There's a lot of swearing and crude jokes. Not much blood. No nudity (damn). If you know Neil or Andrea, you can ask them for their review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; Jason, cell 203-901-4957 (texting is fine too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARKING:&lt;/b&gt; Free lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SYNOPSIS:&lt;/b&gt; Royce (Aaron Sandler) is home for the holidays, but while back from College, his Grandma unexpectedly passes away. She leaves behind the family business (a funeral home) to her only grandson. Royce chooses to take on his Grandmother's legacy with the help of his best friend Seppy (Christopher Husta). Things get tough as the two friends try to run things on their own, dealing with some serious debt to the IRS. While running out of options, Royce and Seppy put together a diabolical plan to save the funeral home. MURDER those in town they can't stand - and COLLECT.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Text me</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292634472000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292354665000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fri. 12/17 - Movie and/or dancing, all at Terminal 110</name><id>15732687</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292630400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/15732687/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/global_20262112.jpeg</photo_url></item>
