Through the energy of joy, love &amp;amp; gratitude, we magnetically attract the gifts of the Universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Law of Attraction becomes very powerful when you feel tremendous joy &amp;amp; excitement and have a deep knowingness of what you want. Since your emotions are your guidance system, accessing your Intuition (your sixth sense, your vibe or gut feelings) can affirm whether what you want to attract is right for you or not. You no longer have to rely exclusively on other peoples' advice &amp;amp; opinions or be in a state of confusion, doubt... &lt;b&gt;Intuition, our invaluable inner compass, helps us to clear the path to attain our heart's desire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ji Hyang, a sixth sensory practitioner,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;ChewHoong, BostonLOA member,&lt;/b&gt; share intuitive games. music and tools that you can use to begin and/or expand your connection with your Intuition. Our desire is that you develop the ability to trust &amp;amp; follow your intuition consciously, mindfully &amp;amp; consistently instead of occasionally &amp;amp; sporadically. This moves you to authentically have more clarity of your purposes and desires. Trusting your vibes allow you to have the confidence to know &amp;amp; attract more of what you truly want in your life and live with more ease &amp;amp; grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Boston Law Of Attraction Meetup is very pleased to offer this get-together with JiHyang's &amp;quot;Trust Your Vibes&amp;quot; community.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Thank-you very much, Ji Hyang and ChewHoong, for your gift of time, knowledge &amp;amp; facilitation of this wonderful adventure into our Intuition.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Ji Hyang:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ji Hyang is a Buddhist Chaplain and Director Of Spirituality &amp;amp; Education at Wellesley College, MA.
