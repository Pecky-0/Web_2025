<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi all! This is a meetup to bring whatever craft project you are working on and meet other crafters! Plus, if you have any craft supplies around the house (or unwanted holiday gifts!), bring them and maybe you can swap them for something you can use! Don't worry if you don't have anything to bring for the swap - it's totally optional. For now, the location is my house in Arlington, but if anyone has a suggestion for a good meeting place closer to a T-stop, let me know. I will email my address and directions to everyone who has RSVP'd &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; by Jan.10. Feel free to bring a drink or snack. No smoking please. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1236452475000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Crafters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondiycrafts</urlname><id>1301641</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Jewelry Design and DIY Crafts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1229648551000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Crafting plus Supplies Swap!</name><id>9360881</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231696800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondiycrafts/events/9360881/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/e/global_5889278.jpeg</photo_url></item>
