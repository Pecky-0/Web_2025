Stefan is here to answer any straggler questions &amp;amp; to help members further use the 2 processes more effectively (discussed at our September In-Person Meetup this past Tuesday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Also, for folks who were at the meetup on Tuesday:&lt;br /&gt;If you want us to mastermind with you to get suggestions of &amp;quot;inspired actions&amp;quot; you can take &lt;br /&gt;re: what you &amp;quot;Nevillized&amp;quot;, join us on the call.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 2 processes have helped Stefan use the Law of Attraction more consistently towards manifesting his huge dreams. These processes are taught by Dr. Joe Vitale, another teacher featured in “The Secret”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The processes respectively relate to Ho’Oponopono and a Cleaning and Clearing Method. They help you identify, isolate, and eliminate counter-intentions that are currently attracting undesired results into your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much, Stefan ( www.greenpointma.com ), for being available for our members this evening.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To review details of September 9th Meetup agenda:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://lawofattraction.meetup.com/139/calendar/8456316/"&gt;http://lawofattractio...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do check our Message Board for info/ discussions from members.
