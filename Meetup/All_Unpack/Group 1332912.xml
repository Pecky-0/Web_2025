Our book choices range from fiction, nonfiction, biography, history, and everything in between.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who loves to read, relax, and socialize with great people is welcome to join. We'll generally keep the RSVPs to 12 people to keep the group manageable and allow everyone to get into the discussion. Looking forward to meeting our new members.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.74</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1228446123000</created><lat>42.9799995422</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>2767</id><urlkey>bookclub</urlkey><name>Book Club</name></topics_item></topics><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name><id>1332912</id><members>406</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>13265674</member_id><name>Laura Anne</name></organizer><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/c/a/600_6582442.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/c/a/highres_6582442.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>6582442</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/c/a/thumb_6582442.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Manchester</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/</link><lon>-71.5100021362</lon></item>
