Its so cool the sign is just a red fez (look for the hat on the sign - its a cone-shaped hat with a gold tassel). Incidently the grilled cheese is amazing. We'll be upstairs at the bar and there are tables to sit at too. So let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Anne Marie is hosting this one!!!
