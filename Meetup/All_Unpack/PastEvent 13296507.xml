I would like to set up a few top ropes from easy to hard.  While I have enough gear to set up two ropes, I'm hoping others can bring additional gear.  If we have enough ropes, I would like to set up one to practice ascending with jumars or prussiks.  If no one brings additional gear, then the size of the event will have to be reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should have some top rope experience.  If you do not, you should try to get instruction at one of the local rock gyms, usually around $50.  If you had instruction and are rusty, just let me know so I can be backup belayer.  You will also need gear: harness, locking caribiner, belay device (GriGri preferred), climbing shoes, helmet, food, water, DEET bug spray, sunblock, and sunglasses.  If you have a rope and anchor gear, please bring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet up at the H wall where I will be setting up one of my ropes.  This is a nice wall because it has a range of climbing from low 5's to 5.9.  There is an online map of the quarries at the Boston Rocks book web site (&lt;a href="http://bostonrocksonline.com/pdf/QQ.pdf)" target="_blank"&gt;http://bostonrocksonl...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weather is wet, we won't be climbing.  I will send out a confirmation email the day or two before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Boston, take I-93 south to Exit 8 (Furnace Brook Parkway/Quincy).  Turn right at Ricciuti Drive.  Go up the hill for 0.2 miles and turn right into the big parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also take public transportation.  Take the Red Line to Quincy Center.  Then, take bus&lt;br /&gt;#215 to Copeland and Willard Streets, walk on Willard Street, go under I-93, then turn right onto Ricciuti Drive.  Walk up the hill for 0.2 miles, and turn right into the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ken Domino</member_name><member_id>4332297</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1273545814000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272308285000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climbing at Quincy Quarries</name><id>13296507</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273323600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/13296507/</event_url></item>
