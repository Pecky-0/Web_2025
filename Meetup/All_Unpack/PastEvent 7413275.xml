I'm so sorry that I won't be there to meet everyone and congratulate Monty and his parents on being reunited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - Kathy is now officially an organizer on this group as well, so if you have any suggestions or ideas for future meetups email either of us and we'll get together to make this the best group possible.  Also a reminder please take pictures so we can show our dogs off to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206494417000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Shiba Inu Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-shiba-inu</urlname><id>792612</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>Shiba Inu Meet Up of Eastern MA &amp; Southern NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204058943000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March Meetup</name><id>7413275</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206205200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-shiba-inu/events/7413275/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/d/global_2504141.jpeg</photo_url></item>
