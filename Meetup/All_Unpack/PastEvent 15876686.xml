Feel free to suggest games you want to play, or wait until you arrive to have me throw a few games at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those who want to immerse themselves in a full day of gaming, think about considering Unity Games XVII in Woburn, MA on Jan. 29, 2011. The game day starts at 9 am and ends at midnight, with 400-ish people in attendance, many of whom have brought games to share with everyone. The cost is $12 if you prepay (and I can collect for those in NH who plan to attend) or $20 at the door. If you want to prepay, the deadline is Jan. 15.
