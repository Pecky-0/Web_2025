I do not know what to expect and would welcome any feedback or advice from any members who have hiked this area. I think we'll need to &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pack a lunch and extra water and treats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for our hardworking hiking friends. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;DIRECTIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIA TRAILHEADS AT WINSLOW STATE PARK:From exit 20 off I-93.
