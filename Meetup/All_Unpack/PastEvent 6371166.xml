<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Meet to play Scrabble every Sunday.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard time is currently 4pm but it has been fluctuating in the last few weeks. If you are interested in joining, RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; and what time you plan to be there.  Some of us show up without RSVPing but there's no guarantee anyone will be there if not coordinated beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are other days/nights you would like to meet, please email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All levels of players are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Eileen</member_name><member_id>4371720</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1193169822000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Scrabble Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>scrabble-326</urlname><id>546956</id><group_lat>41.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>Central CT Scrabble Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189980567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Central CT Scrabble Meetup</name><id>6371166</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192996800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/scrabble-326/events/6371166/</event_url></item>
