It has low fencing all around it making it a quasi dog park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll bring a gate to close off at least one of the entrance holes in the fence. Bring one too if you have any. That way maybe all Paws can be off leash for this meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since this day is also Dave's birthday... how about we go to &lt;a href="http://eatatmoejoe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Moe Joe's Restaurant &lt;/a&gt;afterwards, down the street, and mark the occasion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The restaurant part closes at 8 pm and the sportsbar section is open until 10 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Dave just sent me an email and in his words (which are far more eloquent than mine):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Although I certainly don't want or expect any presents you can put something about I would like to be able to share a piece of my birthday cake with people who show up which I will be bringing with me.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4894798</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1231605682000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231010268000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lighting up Youngsville Park on Dave's Birthday</name><id>9434750</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231283700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/9434750/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/9/1/global_6812961.jpeg</photo_url></item>
