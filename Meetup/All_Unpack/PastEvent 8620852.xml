But we will be talking about one of the greatest secrets that mystics and saints have known for ages: the joy of giving. Here is what it is about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We admire people who are able to give, who are generous and enthusiastic. We secretly think we are able to give and so are a giving person.  But what does it take to give and is there some way to learn how to give to other people?  This lecture will show you how to give of yourself and be generous to other people.  Having light within you is the necessary step to truly being able to give of yourself.  Join us to experience the blessing of being a lighted giver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All are welcome. We will be having this and all future seminars and events at our new location at 844 Grand Ave. in New Haven.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
