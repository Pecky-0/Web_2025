Please join us for good food, good people and good discussion at David Homa's permaculture farm in Portland.  It was nearly two years ago that we formed Transition Initiative Portland and for a variety of reasons, our small initiating group eventually dissolved.  The recent activity on this site has been so exciting to see, and this event is an opportunity for all who is interested and/or curious in engaging in the transition movement here in the Greater Portland area.  The evening will begin with a potluck followed by discussion of what brought us all together and what we might do about it.  It is mostly a chance for us to meet one another, share ideas and possibly begin some discussion of plans and hopes for the future in regards to Transition Initiative Portland!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Homa </member_name><member_id>2587064</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily </member_name><member_id>7733467</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280607370000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>TT'rs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>TI-Portland</urlname><id>1233823</id><group_lat>43.6899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2900009155</group_lon><name>Tohidu Transition - Portland Maine</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279230305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Potluck and Discussion</name><id>14114971</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280352600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/TI-Portland/events/14114971/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/a/global_4989194.jpeg</photo_url></item>
