We tend to play the exact route somewhat by ear, but we'll be traveling between 15 and 20 total miles at a not-very-fast speed. We're going to leave the park by 6pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet us at the parking lot in the front of Fort Adams (near the food vendors on your first right as you enter via Fort Adams Drive). Some people have had trouble finding us in the past, so PLEASE bring my cell phone number so we can direct you if you can't see us. If you see any sailboats in front of you when you're driving, you've traveled too far and missed the parking lot where we're meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to be riding on the roads. That means cars - not a whole lot, but some. For this reason, we *HIGHLY* recommend that you bring a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things you should bring include a bicycle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a joint meetup between the Newport Friends and the Providence Bicycling meetups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, feel free to message me.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call Adam's cell: 401-699-7304.
