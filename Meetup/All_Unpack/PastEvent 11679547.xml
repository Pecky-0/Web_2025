We should make sure everyone knows how to do the upgrade so that we can all take advantage of the fantastic new features in this release!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We'll see what else people want to talk about, and maybe we'll pick one of the following topics depending on what people are interested in: backend database access tips and mysql primer; database backup/monitoring systems; how to set up custom fields; how to write custom searches; etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you think of something specific that you'd like to talk about, please post a comment about it&lt;/b&gt; so that we can begin to develop a somewhat structured agenda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, contact Sean Madsen at 617-283-6304.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sean Madsen</member_name><member_id>10130891</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256857693000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-CiviCRM-Meetup</urlname><id>1462401</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston CiviCRM Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256150671000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston CiviCRM Meetup</name><id>11679547</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1256684400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-CiviCRM-Meetup/events/11679547/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/f/global_8834671.jpeg</photo_url></item>
