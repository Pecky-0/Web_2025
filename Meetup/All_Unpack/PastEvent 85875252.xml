&lt;p&gt;We will be joined by other meetup groups so it should be a fun night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My house is right next to "12 Hampshire Ave" my house is so new that it's not yet on the "gps" system or on any maps, I will have a "Tiki" torch next to my dirt driveway. Please park on the side of the road or driveway. Bring a flashlight if you can as it's quite dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not bring any wood as I have plenty! But brings as much food that you want to share as I'm quite hungry.I do not have electric near the bonfire for reheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $4 or more donation would be greatly appreciated to help cover the cost or running this meetup group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone gets lost my telephone number is: 603-312-6735. If it rains or the winds are too high I will reschedule this event, please check back on this meetup site to see any updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you all there!&lt;/p&gt;
