While no Gradle (someone mind volunteering?), we will have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jQTouch (Jerry Gulla) - &amp;quot; Interested in writing an application for the next generation of&lt;br /&gt;smartphones like the iPhone, Android or Palm Pre but don't have a Mac&lt;br /&gt;or want to learn a new programming language to do it? Now you can,&lt;br /&gt;using the standards-based web technologies you use every day. A jQuery&lt;br /&gt;plugin, jQTouch, makes it easy to write cool apps that look and feel&lt;br /&gt;like native iPhone applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This presentation will cover what jQTouch it, what it does and give&lt;br /&gt;examples of how to create an application using both static and dynamic&lt;br /&gt;data.  You don't need any knowledge about MacOS, Objective-C or Cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;Just HTML, Javascript and a little bit of server-side glue.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grails Database Migrations (Steve Pember) - Curious about ways to deal with changes in production-level databases? Jealous of the Active Record system in Rails? There was some talk / interest in hearing about this subject, so I'll present what I've learned in dealing with database migrations in Grails. I'll discuss the top database migration systems for Grails (although mostly Liquibase, as it's fantastic). You'll learn how to run migrations, get started using migrations amongst your developers, how to get migrations to kick-off automatically on app start, and how to package your migrations into your war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's the glass door on the right at the top of the stairs</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Pember</member_name><member_id>9587085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277915710000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Grails-Boston</urlname><id>1458975</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Boston Grails Users' Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1277262413000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Grails Meetup for June: another round of Mini-Topics</name><id>13883062</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1277854200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Grails-Boston/events/13883062/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/5/global_9810037.jpeg</photo_url></item>
