We can bring some phrase books and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Any requests, we'd love to hear them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed directions:&lt;br /&gt;38 Ash St. is off Washington St., between Kneeland and Marginal Way, opposite Oak St. &lt;br /&gt;The closest T stop is New England Medical Center. &lt;br /&gt;Walk toward the South End (away from Chinatown) on Washington St and take the first left onto Ash St. The entrance to the building is in the first small street on the left. There's a sign for BCNC- Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. Sign in at the front desk and ask for the Meetup conversation group.&lt;br /&gt;Parking is limited in the area, due to the theater district, but sometimes you can find spaces on the surrounding blocks. There are pay lots on Kneeland and Tremont Streets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.bcnc.net" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bcnc.net" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bcnc.net...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1128985258000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Chinese Language November Meetup</name><id>4779950</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1132009200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/4779950/</event_url></item>
