John Joseph is a former Army Instructor and taught a similar course in the Service. Randy Parker, a Surveyor with Land Management Systems, Plymouth, are  setting up a mapping course and preparing excellent materials. While highly professional, you'll find John easy going and patient (I know because he's been trying to teach me what you'll be learning). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The course will begin with classroom instruction on orienting and interpreting a topological map, determining how to find where you are, and planning a trek from point “A” to point “B”.  Classroom work will be followed by an outdoor exercise in which you can practice the skills you learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attendance is limited to 15.  If you have reserved a place but are uncertain as to whether or not you can actually come, please let us know so we can keep our folks on the waiting list informed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to bring a simple (clear plastic) map compass (not a lensatic) with a measuring scale along one edge.  Typically these compasses sell for less than $10.  They’re available at Walmart, REI &amp;amp; EMS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John asks that everyone please dress appropriately for rugged terrain, insects and weather. Bring water and wear a hat, long pants and sturdy shoes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the Headquarter's Conference Building (across from the Headquarter's parking lot). Please be prompt. The class will begin at 9 AM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This course presents a great opportunity for someone who wants to teach others how to read maps and navigate outdoors. If you are interested in teaching others. Let us know so we can assure you space in the class.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharl&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come up the stairs and into the conference building.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286318391000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274291842000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Map Reading &amp; Navigation Training</name><id>13532913</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284210000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/13532913/</event_url></item>
