We will meet in the upper level where they should be able to reserve a table for us at 7:00 and then head downstairs to hear the music which should &lt;a style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;start&lt;/a&gt; at aroundÂ 8:30. It will be a low key night and not a late night for those of you who still have to go to work in the a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who cannot make it for 7:00 p.m. , you should be able to find at 8:30 when the music starts.We can welocome in the first full day of spring with some good freinds,music, and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think I`m going to open this up to our freinds at active singles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am upsating some of the details.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we still do not know if we are still going to be in the upper or lower level, but when you arrive just let them know you are with meetup, and you can give them my name, Tim.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Patrick Clark</member_name><member_id>17851281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1363946900000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1361577457000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ironworks Dinner</name><id>105934992</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363906800000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/105934992/</event_url></item>
