Which room we will be in and on what floor will be announced in a subsequent email.  There is also parking available at a cheap evening rate in the building. Parking is also free on the street in front of the building at 6 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 6:30 PM Jim Wilson will be discussing the often misunderstood features of JavaScript language features such as: * Functions as first class citizens * call() and apply() * Anonymous closures * The &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; keywords.  &lt;a href="http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=Blog" target="_blank"&gt;http://trephine.org/t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He won't be doing a power point.  Rather he will be pasting example code to run into an etherpad, so anyone in attendance with a laptop will be able to make changes or ask questions via code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the presentation | demonstration, we will go around the room introducing ourselves and asking the group for advice | opinions on any JavaScript-related issues members are facing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back from the Cape and will be leading the meeting as well.  I look forward to meeting all our new members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft will provide pizza again. What a generous organization! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and bring guests.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marsh Sutherland</member_name><member_id>3795141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256854802000</updated><rating><average>4.42999982834</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>JavaScripters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>javascript-2</urlname><id>884541</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>The Boston JavaScript Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>44</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253121688000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Often Misunderstood Features of JavaScript Explained.</name><id>11388339</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253829600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/javascript-2/events/11388339/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/4/f/global_2825455.jpeg</photo_url></item>
