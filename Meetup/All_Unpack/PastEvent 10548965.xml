Some call them hindrances, some call them demons, and can include fear, anger, doubt, restlessness, boredom, grasping, and judgment. Regardless of what we call them, by naming them and observing without judgment, we can begin to loosen the power that these distracting emotions can have on us and our practice. Most important is being present with what is, and changing our relationship with aspect of ourselves we might otherwise label as bad or unwanted. Come join us in spiritual community as we seek to cultivate a mindfulness practice. All levels of experience are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting people at the door until about 6:35pm.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247520443000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243897894000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Meetup: 'Naming the Demons'</name><id>10548965</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1246917600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/10548965/</event_url></item>
