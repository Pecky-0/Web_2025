<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a hike that our single members might enjoy. Charlie's Active Singles hikes are for active single people in their 30's through 50's and average up to 100 people per event! These events have been found to be fun and well planned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet-up is at 9:00 AM at location of the hike. Hikers are usually split up into 3 different hiking skill levels (something like advanced, novice, and social) and the difficulty of the hike corresponds. The hike starts at 9:30 AM and usually lasts about 2 hours. Afterwards, dinner facilities are arranged for refueling and socializing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (a bit sketchy but best I have -Contact Charlie for clearer directions): &lt;br /&gt;I-84 West&lt;br /&gt;* Get off Exit 10&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp take right onto Church Hill Rd.&lt;br /&gt;** Follow Church Hill Rd up hill to Intersection of Rte. 25 ( Flagpole ).&lt;br /&gt;* Turn left onto Rte. 25 South and continue on Rte. 25 till it turns into Highway.&lt;br /&gt;* Get off Exit 9, Parking lot is across street at end of Ramp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I-84 East&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 10&lt;br /&gt;* At end of ramp take left onto Church Hill Rd.&lt;br /&gt;* Follow direction above (**).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Route 25 North&lt;br /&gt;*** Take exit 9&lt;br /&gt;* End of ramp turn left onto Daniels Farm Rd.&lt;br /&gt;* Cross over Highway and take first right onto Park St.&lt;br /&gt;* Parking lot on left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merrit Parkway&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 49N onto Rte 25.&lt;br /&gt;* Follow Rte. 25 North directions above (***)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Singles is a 10 year old, non-profit Connecticut organization that brings together singles who enjoy participating in a variety of outdoor activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTACT: Charlie (organizer of Active Singles) 860-489-9611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No official Hartford Area Hiking leadership is planned to be at this hike.
