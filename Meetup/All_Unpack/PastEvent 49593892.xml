&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;If you are participating please RSVP yes to this event and list the link to your donations page so that others in the group can help support you and your efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;If you can't, please consider sponsoring those who are - I am sure they would appreciate a donation of any amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Right now I am not able to participate on this date but encourage our members to get out there for a good cause. If you are going to participate post your desired route in your RSVP so that you can coordinate with others who may be going your way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t able to climb but would like to volunteer there may be a way for you to get involved too. To learn more contact Abby Blackburn, Events Coordinator, at ablackburn@mountwashington.org or (603) 356-2137 x 230.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Seek the Peak?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Seek the Peak welcomes hikers of all ages and abilities from around the world to the rugged, windswept trails of Mount Washington, New Hampshire. Boasting world-class alpine trekking and stunning views to the Atlantic Ocean, Canada, the Adirondack mountains and beyond, Mount Washington is the pinnacle of the New England hiking scene. Scaling its windswept summit as a participant in Seek the Peak offers an immensely rewarding physical challenge, while benefitting a great cause: the legendary Mount Washington Observatory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Sponsored by Subaru and Eastern Mountain Sports, Seek the Peak is Mount Washington Observatory's largest fundraiser. Since the event was founded in 2001, Seek the Peak has raised nearly $1,000,000 for the nonprofit institution, helping it maintain its famous weather station on the summit of Mount Washington and continue its important work collecting weather data, performing research, and educating the public about the science of climate and weather.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Participating in Seek the Peak is not only fun, but rewarding, too. Participants are thanked for their efforts with awesome freebies, a kick-off party, tours of our famous mountaintop weather station, and a huge after party with live music, great food, and thousands of dollars in prize giveaways. It's easy to see why Seek the Peak has grown to become the nation's premier hiking event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
