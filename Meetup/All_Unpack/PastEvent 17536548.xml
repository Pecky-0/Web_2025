<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We will decide where to ski based on who is going and the weather. Possibilities are Lake Cochicutate or Great Herring Pond (Exit 2 off Rt. 3 South in Plymouth) Or at the waterfront place of one of our members. Other possibilities are saltwater near Boston Harbor. We will go depart from my place and then if others will meet at the ramp, will will pick a meet time at the chosen ramp. Share of Gas, etc should be $20.00 I expect the details to get firmed up as people RSVP and we talk about what you want. Please email me your mobile number if I do not already have it. I will have some skis for those who do not have their own. And bring your own if have them for you or to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be here or call my mobile.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter D</member_name><member_id>10327252</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310985697000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>We expect great weather.</why><group><who>Waterskiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonWaterSkiEnthusiasts</urlname><id>1517227</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston WaterSki Enthusiasts</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1304478537000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Waterski - Sunday Morning</name><id>17536548</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310911200000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonWaterSkiEnthusiasts/events/17536548/</event_url></item>
