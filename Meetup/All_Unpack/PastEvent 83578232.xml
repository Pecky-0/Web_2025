Come on over for some beading and bitching. Bring a project of your own -those old earrings you now only have one of, the charm you've been wanting to something with or a project you've been needing to work on, but just have not had the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have beading tools, please bring along as well as any beads or ideas you'd like to share. BYOB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And keep in mind, beading isn't just for jewelry. Think "out of box" curtain tiebacks, hanging light switches, window decor, add a little glamor to clothing or just about any fabric...&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Address will be provided week of event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>5999051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1352763044000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Funseeker</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>nefunseekers</urlname><id>1277691</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>Funseekers!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348324388000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beading &amp; Bitch Girls Night</name><id>83578232</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352507400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nefunseekers/events/83578232/</event_url></item>
