Looks like it's about as good as it's gonna get. I have off Mon and Tuesday. I'm looking at Sunapee on Monday (since it's $39) and Killington on Tuesday (I'll post that seperately). If no one is up for either of those, I might also just do Dartmouth Skiway.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330463311000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330192221000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monday..Ski Mt.
