Their name is World Premier Band. Their a group of guys that dance their a** off and sing really well. They dress nicely and are definitely entertaining. &lt;img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/981263258369601089/img/smileys/smile.gif" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;They sing new and older songs. They do have a website on Facebook. We can meet at 9pm. if you'd like. I don't know the cover charge, but I can call the Charlie Horse when the date gets closer. I guarantee these guys will have you out on the dance floor! &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;There has been a few times&lt;/span&gt; that I've organized meetups and &lt;strong&gt;people don't bother to change their rsvp.&lt;/strong&gt; I ask that you &lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;be courteous&lt;/span&gt; about your rsvp. I think it's RUDE and UNECESSARY. We all have cell phones so please call me on mine to say you'll be late, or if you&amp;nbsp;have any questions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My num. is 508)287-3377. Thanks. See you soon. It'll be fun......&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wait outside of the front door at 9pm. and wait (for 15 min. ) after that I'm going inside!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Amy Deneault</member_name><member_id>7882263</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1317605409000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1314150987000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dancing at the Charlie Horse</name><id>30658331</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1317434400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/30658331/</event_url></item>
