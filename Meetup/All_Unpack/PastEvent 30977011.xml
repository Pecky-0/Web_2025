The bar, one of the largest and certainly the most unique in New Haven, offers nearly 100 types of tequila in addition to an extensive wine list and myriad top-shelf liquors. In winter, the expansive dining room, framed in slate and walnut complete with a leather wall, is warmed by an adobe fireplace (traditionally called a kiva). In the warmer months, the glass paneled wall, which offers a year-round view of Crown Street, opens up onto the largest patio bar and dining area in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align : justify"&gt;While many modern eateries tout "fusion" fare, Geronimo is 100% Southwestern, arguably the original fusion cuisine. &lt;span&gt;The restaurant is named for the infamous Apache rebel whose current resting place, many believe, is New Haven. Geronimo's only request, when he finally&lt;/span&gt; surrendered to American authorities, was that upon his death his bones be returned to his homeland. If Geronimo's skull has, in fact, been brought even farther from his home to reside deep within a society of secrecy in our hometown, then at least we could bring a little flavor from his home to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
