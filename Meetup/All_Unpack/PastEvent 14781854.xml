We still have some details to finalize but wanted to be sure to get this on meetup so you can save the date! This is a great chance to check out the lodge before winter is upon us and the foliage should be spectacular!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current plan is to do a round of Frisbee Golf on Saturday and a hike up Kearsarge Mountain on Sunday. We'll start the weekend with a BYOB social on Friday night around our bar or on our screened in porch. We're working out the details on meals, but we may do a BYOG (G=Grillables) and have a Grillfest on Saturday night or hit a great restaurant in Cornish, ME, depending on numbers. Could be a great board game or camp fire night, depending on weather...so we'll see how the rest comes together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic fees are $20 per person per night for over night lodging. Everyone brings their own towels, toiletries, pillow, sleeping bag. Accommodations are dormitory-style bunk beds, in bedrooms separated by gender. Check out the lodge at www.wedeln.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for main events...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Folf course is in Limerick, ME., about an hour away from the house. There are 36 holes of varying difficulty set on 120 acres. Have a look: &lt;a href="http://www.woodlandva..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.woodlandva...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;The Kearsarge mountain trail head is a quick walk from the Wedeln Lodge. The hike will take 4 to 5 hours, depending on how long we spend up top. It's a moderate to challenging hike, good hiking boots are highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us know if you think you can make it. Whether you are a super duper brand new guest, a repeat guest, or a member, we'd love to have you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know. More details to come!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet on Friday night at the ski house. </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285982341000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Adventurerists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak</urlname><id>1297030</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Ski, Snowboard, and Outdoor Adventurers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284576326000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New Guest Weekend At Wedeln Ski House</name><id>14781854</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285977600000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-adventurers-ski-snowboard-kayak/events/14781854/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/b/9/global_11667001.jpeg</photo_url></item>
