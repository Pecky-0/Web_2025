It foretells Eric Blair's fears of what our future holds. You be the judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Storyline&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After The Atomic War the world is divided into three states. London is the capital of Oceania, ruled by a party who has total control over all its citizens. Winston Smith is one of the bureaucrats, rewriting history in one of the departments. One day he commits the crime of falling in love with Julia. They try to escape Big Brother's listening and viewing devices, but, of course, nobody can really escape... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a depressing movie, but one that MUST be seen by everyone concerned about our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We usually have documentary movies and this movie comes from a novel. The thing is that this book is possibly a documentary about the future, as Eric Blair (George Orwell was his pen name) saw it coming. There is a good article out there comparing the dystopian visions of 1984 and Brave New World. Hopefully someone will bring a copy of that article to this viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a website called Orwell Today that analyzes current news stories and references passages in the articles to sections of 1984 - very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Nashua screenings are at the Balanced Health Center at 9 Simon Street (just a few doors to the right of the Sunset Restaurant). Doors open promptly at 7 and after a review of a few things, we start the movie. Please bring a box of tea or a snack to share with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have other screenings in other areas, so please check the calendar on this site for other offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's don't let 2011 turn out like 1984.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>8382546</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294190082000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294170913000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nashua - Nineteen Eighty-four (1984)</name><id>15916484</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294185600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/15916484/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/1/global_20612881.jpeg</photo_url></item>
