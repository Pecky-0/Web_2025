&lt;p&gt;Check if the &lt;strong&gt;Smoothie Stand&lt;/strong&gt; inside the &lt;strong&gt;Harvard T Station&lt;/strong&gt; is still there and open. It has received good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the pigs, chickens, cows, dairy calves, lambs, sheep, goats, and water living creatures. Worldwide, 51 billion (10 billion US) farmed animals are killed each year. The suffering this represents is staggering. Hidden away, animals are abused and neglected in factory farms throughout the U.S. Female pigs, egg laying hens, and veal calves are kept in cages and crates so small that they cannot turn around. Common practices include tail docking, beak cutting, castration, branding, and forced impregnation, all without anesthesia. Starvation for 7-14 days (forced molting) is routinely practiced on laying hens. Animals' deaths are just as bad. They are dragged, terrified, to their deaths. They are often skinned while still alive. Chickens and other birds are killed without even the most lenient protections. Most "food animals" are killed at such young ages, that if they were dogs or cats, they would still be called puppies or kittens, and farmers would be called animal abusers.&lt;/p&gt;
