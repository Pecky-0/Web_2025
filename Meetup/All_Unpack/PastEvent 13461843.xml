Now's your chance to keep them in tip-top shape! On Saturday, June 5, thousands of REI members, customers and employees will celebrate American Hiking Society's 18th Annual National Trails Day. Roll up your sleeves and join the fun as we build, repair and give back to our favorite trails. For 2010, REI is teaming up with the Essex County Trail Association at Bradley Palmer State Park in Topsfield. Working together with the Mass. Department of Conservation and Recreation, we will help to repair some trails damaged by the winter storms. . Volunteers who register at www.rei.com/stores/26 receive a free t-shirt the day of the event! Meet at 9am; work will finish at 11:30 and then we'll join the other festivities of the day. Don't forget to enter the drawing for a mountain bike donated by REI. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Register at www.rei.com/stores/26 &lt;br /&gt;For the day's events, see &lt;a href="http://www.ectaonline.org/events/june-5-national-trails-day-at-bradley-palmer" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ectaonline...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a Tufts baseball cap and a Meet-up sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275854222000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273683499000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>National Trails Day at Bradley Palmer (REI &amp; ECTA)</name><id>13461843</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275742800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/13461843/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/4/9/global_14993449.jpeg</photo_url></item>
