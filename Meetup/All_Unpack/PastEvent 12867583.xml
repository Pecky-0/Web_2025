So it will be great to see everyone again.  Watch the SOX vs Rays, CELTICS vs Heat, and dinner at 8, followed by Karaoke at 9.  Everyone pays their own way.  On good thing is there is no cover charge.  Also, the food is great, the hospitality is superb, and terrific company too!  Spring in full swing ;) (Yes - pun intended).  Lol.  NOTE:  We will meet at the bar in time for our dinner reservation.   The SOX game starts at 710.  If you wish to get there in time for the first pitch, then feel free.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Slammer</member_name><member_id>9179551</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271722015000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268506434000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner/Watch SOX and CELTICS/Karaoke</name><id>12867583</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271548800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/12867583/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/7/global_9098151.jpeg</photo_url></item>
