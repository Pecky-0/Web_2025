Fifty-three years running for New Haven, and four for the NHC. Don't fancy parades, you say? Well this ain't your grandpappy's St. Patrick's Day Parade! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, the elected officials of this fair burg of ours, in their infinite wisdom, have long decreed that imbibing openly upon city streets is to be allowed on this festival of festivals (but no other day). So don't be shy! Pick your favorite poison, your means of conveyance for said poison (handbag, backpack, wagon, draft animal, spouse, etc.), and come on out to hoist to the saint. But wait, you say, St. Patrick's Day isn't until the 17th! Well and true enough, but in New Haven, we're so hardcore that we have a pre-St. Patrick's Day St. Patrick's Day! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in years past, starting at 12:15 we'll be staking out the sidewalk in front of the Yale Art Gallery, for the administrators of that institution generously allow the public at large to use their facilities, free of charge (perhaps, ironically, hoping to avert enthusiastic artistic expression on the part of those who might otherwise see the outside wall of the gallery as one huge canvas). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parade starts at 1pm. Those driving should be able to find parking in the York Street garage.  If you don't mind a little walk, depending upon how long you park, parking at Yale-New Haven's Air Rights garage could save you anywhere from a little to a lot of money.  Traffic-wise it should also be easier to get in/out of the garage (where the heck did they get the name Air Rights anyway?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info on the parade, click here &lt;a href="http://www.stpatricksdayparade.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stpatricks...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in sum, I hope you'll join us in painting the town green. Feel free to wear your most oddest green clothing and hats imaginable so you'll fit right in!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Robyn-Allise 203.823.5302 Once parade is underway, unsure if I'll be able to hear my phone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238341809000</updated><rating><average>4.61999988556</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1236029556000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NHCs 4th Anniversary Attending the New Haven St. Patricks Day Parade !!!</name><id>9863191</id><headcount>40</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237133700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9863191/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/b/0/global_7526224.jpeg</photo_url></item>
