Then, there will be a relaxation or concentration exercise followed by a guided meditation. This meet up will meet for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wanted to invite you to these great seminars coming up at the Center of Light lead by Father Peter Bowes. He is one of the Great Teachers who has devoted his life in service to God. The one called &amp;quot;silence&amp;quot;on Friday February 6 is particularly related to meditation. They are posted as new meet ups in the home page and when you click on it you will be able to see all the description of the seminars and who Father Peter Bowes is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward seeing you soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Peace,&lt;br /&gt;Rev.Christine&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273544096000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232375433000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Boston Meditation Meetup</name><id>9555006</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233189000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/9555006/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/8/global_1017208.jpeg</photo_url></item>
