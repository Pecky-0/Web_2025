&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May I Be Frank -  A film About Sex, Drugs and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May I Be Frank documents  the transformation of Frank Ferrante's life. Frank is 54 years old,  obese, depressed and addicted. He stumbles into a local raw, organic and  vegan restaurant in San Francisco, Caf&amp;eacute; Gratitude.&amp;nbsp; When Ryland, a  server at Caf&amp;eacute; Gratitude asks Frank "What is one thing you want to do  before you die?" Frank replies, "I want to fall in love one more time,  but no one will love me looking the way I do". &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ryland, his  brother Cary, and Conor, his best friend, are inspired by the  possibility of helping Frank.&amp;nbsp; For the next 42 days, Frank will eat only  raw food, practice gratitude, visit local holistic practitioners, and  get a weekly colonic.&amp;nbsp; Ryland, Conor, and Cary get to support Frank's  miraculous transformation.&amp;nbsp; Frank gets a new body, a clearer mind, and  most importantly, a soaring spirit.&amp;nbsp; May I Be Frank documents the  essence of the human condition and what it truly means to fall in love  again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To help  clarify what food is and what food isn't raw vegan;  &lt;br /&gt;2. Our members  may of course eat whatever they like when not attending our events but  when bringing a dish to our events, it is imperative that the dish be  100% raw vegan so all members attending will be able to eat the dish as  some of our members are 100% raw vegan; and &lt;br /&gt;3. To help our members  get the most nutritional and enzyme benefits from food.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Definitions: &lt;br /&gt;Raw  means that the food was not cooked, baked, roasted, pasteurized or  heated over 118 degrees. &lt;br /&gt;Vegan means that there are no animal  products or honey included. These are animal products:  animal meat,  fowl, fish, fish eggs, chicken or other eggs and cow or goat dairy  products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh is Best:  &lt;br /&gt;When adopting a raw food diet and  creating delicious raw food recipes, the main goal is to include as much  fresh food into your daily diet. Raw living fresh fruits, vegetables,  seeds and nuts can be combined to make delicious and unique flavors.  Adding anything that is NOT fresh will generally reduce the nutritional  benefit of the food. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many things that are labeled "raw" or  "fresh" have actually been flash-cooked (or flash- pasteurized).&amp;nbsp;This  kills "bad" bacteria, but also harms good bacteria, enzymes and  vitamins.&amp;nbsp;For example, "raw" almonds from California are required to be  pasteurized, while "raw" almonds from Spain or Utah are not.&amp;nbsp;We  recommend looking for the word "unpasteurized" on miso, juices, tahini,  nuts and nut milks.&amp;nbsp;Most unpasteurized liquids come in glass bottles not  cartons or plastic.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Action Guide: &lt;br /&gt;1. If you are using  something that has multiple ingredients, please read the label and  ingredients list carefully and compare any questionable ingredients to  this document.  &lt;br /&gt;2. If you are uncertain if an ingredient is 100% raw  vegan, please exclude it from your dish.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Environmental Impact: &lt;br /&gt;According  to John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods Market, a full third of the  energy used in the production and consumption of food is at the final  stage of cooking. Raw foodists do not cook food so that energy is saved.  Please consider reducing the use of dehydrators, juicers, blenders and  food processors to keep the energy use down when preparing delicious raw  vegan meals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the Creative Process: &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the creative  process and challenge yourself to come up with wonderful meals using the  freshest ingredients without using too many ingredients or dried  products. Creating food &amp;ldquo;to live for&amp;rdquo; starts with &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; foods.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Below  are suggestions and ideas to assist you in creating amazing fresh  dishes.  &lt;br /&gt;We appreciate you and want to support you in your raw living  foods experience. &lt;br /&gt;Raw Vegan Food Information &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Always Raw Vegan  Foods (use these foods primarily): &lt;br /&gt;Live fruits; &lt;br /&gt;Live vegetables;  and &lt;br /&gt;Live nuts and seeds labeled as "raw." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raw Vegan Foods that  are processed: &lt;br /&gt;Kombucha; and &lt;br /&gt;Miso. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not Raw Vegan Foods: &lt;br /&gt;Bee  pollen; &lt;br /&gt;Capers; &lt;br /&gt;Dairy products (lactose, casein, yogurt, cheese,  milk products;  &lt;br /&gt;Flour (sprouted live grains are raw vegan); &lt;br /&gt;Honey  (agave nectar can be substituted only if it says on the label that it is  "raw"); and &lt;br /&gt;Maple syrup is always boiled down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not Really Raw  Vegan Foods (used by some raw foodists but not others--under dispute): &lt;br /&gt;Braggs  Liquid Amino Acids;  &lt;br /&gt;Nama Shoyu (yes it is fermented and live but it  started from cooked soy and wheat); &lt;br /&gt;Nutritional Yeast is produced by  culturing the yeast with a mixture of sugarcane and beet molasses. This  again starts from a cooked product (sugarcane and molasses) and then in  many cases MSG is used to preserve it. Since the yeast is a live  enzyme, many raw foodists use nutritional yeast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not Necessarily  Raw Vegan Foods: &lt;br /&gt;Agave nectar is raw only if it says on the label  that it is "raw"; &lt;br /&gt;Dried fruits or dried veggies are raw only if  heated to 118 degrees maximum when dried: &lt;br /&gt;Nori sheets are only raw  when they are labeled as "raw"; &lt;br /&gt;Nuts and Seeds are raw only if they  are labeled as "raw." They are best when soaked &amp;amp; sprouted; &lt;br /&gt;Vegetable  Oil is raw only if the label states that it is "cold pressed";  &lt;br /&gt;Olives  are raw only if they are specifically labeled as "raw" olives;  &lt;br /&gt;Sea  salt other than Celtic and Real Salt are processed; and  &lt;br /&gt;Vinegar is  raw only if it is labeled as "raw." Some makers of apple cider vinegar  are secretive about how they make it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is best to Buy Organic  because: &lt;br /&gt;1. Organic foods have more nutrients by and large; &lt;br /&gt;2.  Organic foods have fewer pesticides and chemicals; and &lt;br /&gt;3. Organic  foods are sustainable and come from chemical-free land. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raw Vegan  Food by Flavors &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raw Vegan Sweeteners: &lt;br /&gt;1. Agave Nectar only  when it says "Raw" on the label; &lt;br /&gt;2. Bananas, ripe and preferably  spotted; &lt;br /&gt;3. Dates pitted, most dates that have been pitted usually  have been steamed. Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s and Whole Foods carry dates with pits  for raw food dishes; &lt;br /&gt;4. Palm Sugar look for it at Whole Foods; &lt;br /&gt;5.  Raisins, look for organic varieties as they usually have no additives;  and &lt;br /&gt;6. Stevia powder or better yet Stevia leaf may be used as long as  it is just the Stevia without additives.  &lt;br /&gt;7. Any sweet fruit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raw  Vegan Sour Flavors: &lt;br /&gt;1. Lemon; &lt;br /&gt;2. Lime; &lt;br /&gt;3. Raw Apple Cider  Vinegar only when it says "Raw" on the label although preferably use  Lime or Lemon juice.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raw Salty Flavors: &lt;br /&gt;1. Celery; &lt;br /&gt;2.  Celtic or Real Sea Salt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Dill; &lt;br /&gt;4. Kelp or Dulse;  &lt;br /&gt;5. Nama  Shoyu (could use sea salt and dates or raw agave to replace the Nama  Shoyu flavor); &lt;br /&gt;6. Nori sheets only when it says "Raw" on the label;  and &lt;br /&gt;7. Miso. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raw Spicy Flavors: &lt;br /&gt;1. Cayenne Pepper (confirm  that it's raw); &lt;br /&gt;2. Live Jalapeno pepper; &lt;br /&gt;3. Dried chili pepper  (confirm that it's raw); &lt;br /&gt;4. Freshly ground pepper &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raw Bitter  Flavor: &lt;br /&gt;Fresh or dried herbs such as dill, parsley, basil, cilantro,  etc; and &lt;br /&gt;Seasoning blends Spice Hunter or Spicely or Whole Foods  brands are good. &lt;br /&gt;Use herbs that you know have been dried properly,  dry them yourself if possible or buy from companies such as &amp;ldquo;Spice  Hunter,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Spicely,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Whole Foods.&amp;rdquo; Herbs do not take much heat to dry  them; 90 to 95 degrees works well.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Created by Darlene Navarre  contact@fruitygreenfamily.com and Daryl Elliott elliott7@comcast.net  with an assist by Jason Firth. &lt;br /&gt;Version 6, January 6, 2010&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please print or make a Meetup Name Tag http://www.meetup.com/RawBoston/grow/nametags/ and contact members via Meetup messages to carpool.
