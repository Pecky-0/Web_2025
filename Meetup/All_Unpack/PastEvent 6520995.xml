The discussion was lively and the thirst for knowledge about Fibromyalgia and how to recover was intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the November meeting I will be talking about Detoxification and Supplementation as it relates directly to Fibromyalgia sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come prepared with questions and please think about the healthcare providers that have helped you with this illness.  Bring a list with the practitioner's name and phone number and any relevant information you have about them so we can add them to a master list in the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Betsy Timmerman</member_name><member_id>3507700</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195171642000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>People With Fibromyalgia</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fibromyalgia-301</urlname><id>586410</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191974646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Reading Fibromyalgia November Meetup</name><id>6520995</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194998400000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fibromyalgia-301/events/6520995/</event_url></item>
