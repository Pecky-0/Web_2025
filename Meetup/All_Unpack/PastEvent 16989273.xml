&lt;p&gt;Environmental Lobby Day is your chance to "green up" the Massachusetts Statehouse! Join the Sierra Club and our environmental allies for a day of advocacy, bringing environmental concerns and priorities directly to state lawmakers and officials. We will work to arrange appointments for you with as many lawmakers/staff lawmakers as well as give you tips and information to make your meetings as productive as possible. The day includes lunch at the Statehouse with lawmakers, staff, professional environmental lobbyists, and other citizen activists. &lt;em&gt;This is a free event&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the Grand Staircase, 2nd floor.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mass Sierra</member_name><member_id>3278292</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1303498284000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Make Your Voice Heard on Earth Day!
