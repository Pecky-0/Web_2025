These movies cost only &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; per ticket ($4 for Criterion Club members) and show at 11:00am on Saturday and Sunday. I will choose one of the days and if you can't go on that day and want to go the other day, feel free.&amp;nbsp; The start time is always 10:45am because they show the movies promptly at 11:00am with no trailers.&amp;nbsp; Saturday is supposed to be rainy, perfect day to stay inside and see a classic film on the big screen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get information about any of the films by going to their website and scrolling over the poster:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.bowtiecinemas.com/cine-classics-plaza.php"&gt;http://www.bowtiecinemas.com/cine-classics-plaza.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not seen "North by Northwest" on a big screen, you really need to do it.&amp;nbsp; The scale adds tension to several key scenes.&amp;nbsp; Hitchcock's 1959 film, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and others, tells the story of "middle-aged Madison Avenue advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill [who] is mistaken for a government agent by a gang of spies. He gets involved in a series of misadventures and is pursued across the States by both the spies and the government whilst being helped by a beautiful blonde."&amp;nbsp; Which is rather like&amp;nbsp;describing 'Psycho' as "Marion Crane checks into a hotel while on the lam."&lt;/p&gt;
