I Love You, released 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A young widow discovers that her late husband has left her 10 messages intended to help ease her pain and start a new life. Staring: Hillary swank, Gerard Butler, Harry Connick Jr. plus many more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IF you can't meet us at 6:00 but still want to come and join in, don't worry you can join us the movie starts at 7:30, you just have to be there before that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chunky's has changed their policy for groups making reservations. This is not my policy. It is theirs. PLEASE read below carefully. If for any reason you do not think that you can keep your RSVP or agree with their policy, please update your RSVP as soon as possible I will be giving the correct count of people attending in our group(s), by Tuesday 2/19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their policy is that if 25% of the group doesn't attend,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I will get charged&lt;/strong&gt; a $25.00 flat fee for the missing people&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I am taking a chance on you past “no shows”, that you will come through and attend this event seeing that you have already signed up. IF you have been a no-show in the past, then send me a message and tell me if you plan on coming to the movie this time, I would HATE to have to pay for something that is out of my control and totally in yours!! Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost for the movie:&lt;/strong&gt; FREE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food:&lt;/strong&gt; You pay for what you eat, we will try for separate checks or get 2 people on each check, so it is easy to figure out for everyone, please try to bring small bills so it is easy to figure out what you have to pay and easy on the waitstaff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reservation:&lt;/strong&gt; I have already made the reservation for the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be scheduled on my 2 Meetup sites, (Our Circle of Friends and Connection &amp;amp; Friends) there may be more people going to this event then you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute now and put the Meetup phone into your phone, that way if you are are running late, can’t find us or need to cancel at the last minute, you already have it in your phone: 978-304-2811, please note this phone does not accept text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time for you to pay your dues? Please look at your profile page where it states “Membership dues last recorded by your Organizer” You can pay your dues at any event. Thank you in advance for paying your dues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow may cancel this event please remember to check back to see if we are still going to this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a courtesy to everyone in the group come back to the event page and change your RSVP if your plans change or call me/send a message through the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing you at this event!&lt;/p&gt;
