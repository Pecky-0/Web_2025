I've reserved 10 spots under my credit card but when you reserve, you must reserve under your credit card and they will deduct from my credit card your confirmation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll likely bike about 20 miles per day, eat, have ice cream, bike some more, eat again :-), and swim at the beach etc...  stuff like that :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could rent a group taxi into town for night life.....whatever the group feels like doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Youth Hostel is $35 per night.  Parking is at 49 Yarmouth Rd and is $15 per day.  There is a shuttle from the parking lot to the dock at 141 School St.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll take the Steamship Authority from Hyannis on the 9:15 am departure.  Cost for the ferry is $33 round trip plus $12 for bikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a $5 fee that goes toward maintaining this group's website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;More details to follow!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob Fox, Organizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please indicate in your RSVP if you'll be doing the day or overnight option.
