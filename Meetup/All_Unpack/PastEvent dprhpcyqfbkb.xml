&lt;p&gt;Long ago, the Sabrak clan of dwarves, in an effort to restore their clan&amp;rsquo;s lost power and status, meddled with dark forces in the Sunset Mountains. The dwarves succeeded only in creating their own isolation and madness. Their clan grew smaller and ever more degenerate&amp;mdash;so that today, only the three brothers who lead the clan and a handful of other dwarves remain. Of the three brothers, Zarnak, the eldest and most powerful, is a seer whose mind shattered long ago when it came into contact with an ancient evil known as the Elder Elemental Eye... and who now plots to spread the abyssal plague throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players who played in the last season "Beyond the Crystal Cave" can transfer one item they gained from that season to their new character this season to give them an extra edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D Encounters is a bi-weekly Wednesday ongoing in-store campaign, playable in two encounters per meetup (approximately 2-3 hours per meetup). Players earn experience and treasure for their characters as they participate in a compelling ongoing story arc that lasts for a few months. &amp;nbsp;They also gain reknown points that earn them special promotional fortune cards available nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This season also features the newest set of D&amp;amp;D Fortune Cards from the "Spiral of Tharizdun" set.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dale King</member_name><member_id>4528347</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David P.
