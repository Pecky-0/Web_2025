That being said, it appears that there is a &lt;a href="http://www.riparks.com/pdfs/coltmap.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;parking lot near the office&lt;/a&gt; - let's plan to meet there tomorrow at 2pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be the one with a red bike and red helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing you there -- otherwise I hope you're all enjoying a great holiday weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Labor Day weekend but you'll work for your holiday with this ride (get it? labor means work??). Anyway, I'll add more details later but wanted to at least get this on your calendar. We'll plan to start at the Colt State Park in Bristol, RI (plenty of parking, restrooms). It'll be another out-and-back trip so the group/individuals can determine how long we'll ride once we get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 14.5 miles of paved bike path with connection to 3 miles of paved path in&lt;br /&gt;Colt State Park in Bristol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: Predominately flat with one steep hill in East Providence. Path exposed to&lt;br /&gt;Narragansett Bay on upper and lower stretches, making for occasional stiff head winds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail condition: Good to average. This is the state's oldest major bike path. A long&lt;br /&gt;section in Barrington was resurfaced in 2001. Narrower than most newer bike paths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special characteristics: This path provides a vision for all other bike paths in&lt;br /&gt;Rhode Island, connecting five communities. Terrain is very diverse from city to urban&lt;br /&gt;waterfront to bayfront to forested areas to neighborhoods and villages centers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural attractions nearby: Boating and fishing in Narragansett Bay. Passive&lt;br /&gt;recreation in Colt State Park. Wildlife viewing at Audubon Society of Rhode Island&lt;br /&gt;Education Center in Bristol, with long boardwalk bisecting the path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historical attractions nearby: Historic homes and shopping districts in East&lt;br /&gt;side of Providence, Warren center, Bristol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Services nearby: Shops, restaurants, museums, schools, government centers,&lt;br /&gt;libraries, parks, ferries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: From Route 95, take Rte. 195 east to Gano Street exit. Take left to&lt;br /&gt;India Point Park. Trail begins at right with ramps to path running on bridge alongside highway.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bethany</member_name><member_id>10111481</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252623489000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251161201000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>East Bay Bike Path</name><id>11191553</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252260000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/11191553/</event_url></item>
