It is Oktoberfest time in Newport!!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I will be sailing somewhere in the Caribbean on October 9th (well, maybe that is not so unfortunate after all... :-), but our Bettie is there and has volunteered to &amp;quot;host&amp;quot; this event for us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you, who have never been to the October Fest, this is a great opportunity to enjoy a fun part of the German culture: German beer songs, German beer, German Volk-dance shows, German food and A LOT of German minded people. I can tell you it has always been a lot of fun. I am sad I am not around this year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bettie will meet you at the entrance of the tent at the Newport Yachting Center at around 2 p.m. If you can't make it until then her phone number is 401 523 1930. Tickets are $ 20 at the door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a lot of pictures so we can post them here on the web site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun all of you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viele Gruesse, Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Bettie with the German flag!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bettie</member_name><member_id>8418124</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286718287000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284319679000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Oktoberfest in Newport!</name><id>14744155</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286647200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/14744155/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
