<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;br /&gt;Ten miles of trails include the Milliken Memorial Path, planted with flowering shrubs in the late 1920s by Arthur N. Milliken as a memorial to his wife, Mabel Minott Milliken. Several glacial erratics dot the landscape, including a grouping called Ode's Den, named after Theodore &amp;quot;Ode&amp;quot; Pritchard, who lived under one of the boulders after losing his home in 1830. Bigelow Boulder honors the author of the first volume of The Narrative History of Cohasset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sixty-two-acre Turkey Hill is co-managed with the Towns of Cohasset and Hingham. Its 187-foot summit affords spectacular views. A cinderblock NIKE building is all that remains of an anti-missile radar control station sited here during the Cold War to thwart potential nuclear attack by the Soviet Union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of Whitney and Thayer Woods was originally the &amp;quot;Common Lands of the Hingham Planters,&amp;quot; referring to the colonists who settled the area beginning around 1634. Around 1904, Henry M. Whitney began purchasing parcels of abandoned farmland to create a private estate. The Whitney Woods Association later acquired much of the estate and donated more than 600 acres to The Trustees of Reservations in 1933. Ten years later, Thayer Woods was also donated, and the Reservation became known as Whitney and Thayer Woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/392_whitney_and_thayer_woods.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thetrustee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the Turkey Hill entrance in the parking lot at the end of Turkey Hill Lane (at the cell towers):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;time=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;ttype=&amp;amp;q=290+Turkey+Hill+Lane+Hingham+MA&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=30.957823,71.015625&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.24056,-70.853727&amp;amp;spn=0.007053,0.017338&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;om=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;From Route 3, take exit 14 and follow Route 228 north for 5.8 mi toward Hingham.  Turn right onto Leavitt Street off Route 228 just before reaching Hingham Town Hall. Follow for 0.6 mi and bear left onto Turkey Hill Lane. Continue on Turkey Hill Lane until it dead ends into Turkey Hill. Entrance and parking area on left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest using the google maps link above and noting the street names for RT 228 North (they change several times) to generate your own directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the walking will be on flat, wide, gravel and dirt packed roads.  There will be some&lt;br /&gt;sections with rocks and roots that are more technically challenging.  Overall a moderate walk.&lt;br /&gt;Hiking boots/sneakers are recommended.  The walk will be about 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If people are interested, we can meet for lunch at Not Your Average Joe's.&lt;br /&gt;111 Pond Street (RT 228) Norwell MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.notyouraveragejoes.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.notyourave...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=111+Pond+St,+Norwell,+MA+02061&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;dirflg=&amp;amp;saddr=290+Turkey+Hill+Lane+Hingham+MA&amp;amp;f=d&amp;amp;sll=42.171324,-70.886364&amp;amp;sspn=0.007061,0.017338&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.176762,-70.865593&amp;amp;spn=0.028242,0.069351&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;om=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198525014000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197212211000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Whitney and Thayer Woods (Turkey Hill)</name><id>6882657</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198341000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/6882657/</event_url></item>
