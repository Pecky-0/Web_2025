  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;RSVPs open&amp;nbsp;on July 12 at 6:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event takes place at 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, July 20, at Phillips Auditorium, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge. Doors open at 7:30 p.m., but 
&lt;strong&gt;get there early . . . even before 7:15 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served for the main lecture room. The overflow crowd sits in a separate screening room. Admission is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If weather permits, rooftop stargazing through telescopes will follow the presentation. Dress for stargazing. Don't forget to protect yourself against mosquitoes at this time of night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the "staff only" signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Harvard stop on the MBTA Red Line, take any bus or trackless trolley going west on Concord Avenue in Cambridge (Arlmont Village and Belmont Center&amp;nbsp;buses; Huron Avenue trolley) and get off at the Observatory Hill stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For more information and directions,&lt;/strong&gt; go to&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events&lt;/a&gt; or call 617.495.7461.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line forms early for this event. Please do not cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. (If you are in the separate screening room, turn right after you exit and walk toward the courtyard, then look for signs pointing the way to the telescopes.) You can also look for me and my meetup sign while we are waiting in line to look through the telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the left rear of the lecture hall is a way to let people find me and an empty seat that much more easily. The lectures are lots of fun, though, and I can certainly understand if you would like to sit up front and closer to the (very entertaining!) talks. Please sit where you are most comfortable. If you are bringing children to the event, you may want to sit toward the front so they can see and ask questions. We will be able to chat after the lecture, while we wait in line for a chance to stargaze through the several rooftop telescopes. Each telescope is usually trained on a different sight in the nighttime sky, so waiting in several lines gives us plenty of time to introduce ourselves. And plenty of nighttime objects to observe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span style="color : #19294b"&gt;"The Real Music of the Spheres," Don Kurtz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;
    &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;We human are visual creatures -- "seeing is believing." But there are other ways to know the world and the universe. For many species of bats, "hearing is believing." Two thousand five hundred years ago,&amp;nbsp;the Pythagoreans believed in a celestial Music of the Spheres -- an idea that reverberated down the millennia in Western music, literature, art, and science. Now we know that there is a real music of the spheres. The stars have sounds in them that we can use to see right into their very cores. This multimedia lecture will look at the relationship of music&amp;nbsp;to stellar sounds. You will hear the real sounds of the stars&amp;nbsp;(with a key change) and musicial compositions where every member of the orchestra is a real (astronomical) star. The Kepler spacecraft lets us "hear" the stars 100 times better than with telescopes on the ground. Come see exciting discoveries about strange stars and learn how stellar sounds help in the search for another Earth. 
    &lt;strong&gt;*****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;We will go&amp;nbsp;to the Algiers Coffee House (40 Brattle Street, Harvard Square), if people would like to go out after the lecture, or&amp;nbsp;after the stargazing,&amp;nbsp;weather permitting.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
