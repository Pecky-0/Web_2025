Those that are available to help out will meet at the Lots and More parking lot and then drive over to West Road which is the street we adopted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of this project is real simple. Pick up the trash along side the street. There will be trash pokers and pickers, so no need to worry about picking up anything nasty by hand. Garbage bags will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions, please contact Sharon Harden at sryals@mail.com or 860-268-2204.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meeting at Lots &amp; More parking lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Petrillo</member_name><member_id>8764866</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258592152000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256936985000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Adopt a Road</name><id>11751737</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258299000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/11751737/</event_url></item>
