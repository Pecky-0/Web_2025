We are hoping to have a few games going on in smaller groups. This way we can venture into some games that have not been played yet. Please feel free to bring any of your favorite games. We have lots of two player games and a few group games, but would be very interested in learning new ones or experiencing the classics. The event will start at 7, feel free to bring snacks and drinks. Alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks are welcome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll see you with your festive holiday sweaters in December!
