Shar's Pugs, Buford, Millie, and Max are all celebrating their birthdays, and all their Puggie friends are invited.  Bow-wow-ownies! shrieks Clovis!  Back we all go to that fabulous huge yard in Carver.  Nuts to the yard, sez Stone, I'm sneaking into the kitchen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a quiet street with plenty of parking.  We hope to see you all there!  Please bring folding chairs.  The group has grown big enough so that there probably won't be enough resident chairs to go around...    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluids will be provided, but now we are counting on our various meetup members to bring the goodies - since they've already been doing a bang up job of packing the table with tasty treats for Pugs and owners alike.   It isn't just the Pugs who stuff themselves at these meetups... your faithful organizer manages to go home with an extra pound or two on board every single time!    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT FEED CLOVIS!  He has a damaged brain stem and has trouble swallowing.  Imagine a Pug who has trouble swallowing!  (Okay, you can feed him bits of soft food broken into tiny pieces... are you happy now, Clovis?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next meetup is on the SECOND Sunday of November.  See you then!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR LAST MEETUP...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had some pretty unusual visitors at our Halloween meetup.  First of all, several members of the Red Sox showed up.  A shark with his half eaten dinner, arms still flailing, showed up.  A pony appeared.  Various bugs, a fourlegged hotdog, a Hawaiian dancer, a working stiff in dayglo orange with his tools on his back.  Even a chubby mummy showed up, mournfully trailing his rags...  And a (real) Brussels Griffon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was our biggest meetup yet - I counted at least 36 people, which means about 40 Pugs, the Griffie, and the obligatory French Bulldog, showed up.  This was Zoe's first house party, and she and her parents handled it well.  Nice job fencing the back yard, John!  The picnic table was loaded with goodies and surrounded by Pugs, an enterprising few of whom managed to make it onto the table.  I think it was Bugsy who dived headlong into the pumpkin cookies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did everyone have a great time?  You bet they did!  We hope to see everyone back at the next meetup!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE MEETUPS...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all responsible Pug owners here, so don't be concerned about your baby. Wherever we meet, we'll make sure to have shade and plenty of water for keeping Pugs cool. There will be biscuits for the dogs and soft drinks and something to snack on for the adults! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other small dogs are welcome, but please ask in advance if you can bring dogs other than Pugs. If you have a little Puggie roughneck on your hands, you can bring him too - but be prepared to keep an eye on him. We want everyone to have fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your organizer pays $19.95 per month for the privilege of organizing the South of Boston Pug Meetups, and believe me, it's worth every penny for the fun we have! If you would like to help defray the costs, make a voluntary contribution of $1.00 to Charlotte Creeley each time you attend. Remember, it's VOLUNTARY - even if I had to pay twice as much, it would be worth it for the just to see the smile on Clovis and Stoney's faces when Puggie Sunday rolls around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are coming to your first meetup, please let us know, so we can introduce you to everyone and make you and your Puggies feel welcome!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Creeley</member_name><member_id>2129718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194980879000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Pug People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SouthofBostonPugs</urlname><id>226623</id><group_lat>42.0800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South of Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>35</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192388769000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The South of Boston Pug November Meetup</name><id>6548849</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194807600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SouthofBostonPugs/events/6548849/</event_url></item>
