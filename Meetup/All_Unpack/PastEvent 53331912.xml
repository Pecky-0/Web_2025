<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;So I decided that this will be the year of health, wealth and VIGOR.... so to that end we will be hosting (and I'm looking for some creative ideas and help) a series of events that will help all of us become healthier more vibrant human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will have to do with diet, some with exercise of all kinds, some dealing with mental and spiritual growth (I really need help with that one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be making these up as I go along so I'm serious - I want your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it's short notice but I want to try to do cooking classes at least twice per month. The first one is on Salads. We all need more raw vegetables and I get sick of the same old combinations. So I'm looking for some of your ideas and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Monday night I will choose at least 3 salads for our group to sample. And those salads will come from you my fellow members. I will make my favorite. If you have a specialty please let me know.&amp;nbsp; No worries if you don't have one. Your only requirement to attend is the desire and will to create a healthier lifestyle. In addition to salad ingredients if anyone has any great Salad dressing recipes - please bring them along with the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you bring a recipe please email it to me so I can print copies for the guests. Bring a 3 ring binder and you can start your own cookbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please no store bought salads or dressings. Organic if possible. I know that's not in everyones budget but it would be good to share ideas and recipes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will email address to attendees</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger L</member_name><member_id>7989869</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330956201000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329923876000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vigor - Salad Night at my house</name><id>53331912</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330471800000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/53331912/</event_url></item>
