Organizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather looks good for next Saturday so come on out to Revere Beach for a kite festival.  The turnout should be good and arriving early will give us the opportunity to capture pre-flight activities as well as kites in the sky.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event begins at 9:00 AM.  We can shoot 9:00 - Noon and anyone who wishes can remain and make it a full beach day.  There's free street parking but keep in mind if it's a &amp;quot;beach day&amp;quot;, spaces near the event may fill up fairly early.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're up early, come for breakfast at Santorini's.  I'll be there at 8:00 am for pancakes.  Let me know if you want to meet early by answering the question when you RSVP or post on the message board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a little more info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seasidekites.com/local-events/info_10.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.seasidekit...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet 9:00 AM at the sea wall directly across from Santorini's</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne</member_name><member_id>5274985</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219669773000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CAPEGroup</urlname><id>729767</id><group_lat>42.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.6200027466</group_lon><name>Cape Ann Photography Excursion (CAPE) Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219115190000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Revere Beach Kite Festival</name><id>8574036</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219496400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/events/8574036/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_3584529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
