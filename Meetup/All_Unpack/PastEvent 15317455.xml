We hope that choices like that will make YOUR choice easy, and that you'll join us at 7:00 pm on Thursday, November 18th, to meet the Martin's newest girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mia Regazza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;287 Washington St. (Route 18)&lt;br /&gt;Abington, MA 02351&lt;br /&gt;781-871-5800&lt;br /&gt;Website: &lt;a href="http://www.miaregazza.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mia Regazza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizer:&lt;/b&gt; Mike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Yes. Two per member allowed.

Grilled pizzettas start at $6.99 (8 inch) and $9.99 (12 inch) and go up as you add toppings.

Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over four years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, November 17th @ 7:00 pm. Any changes made after this time may not be seen by the Event Organizer.
