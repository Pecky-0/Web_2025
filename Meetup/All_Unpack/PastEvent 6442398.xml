The practices are held each Sunday from 4:30-6:00 pm at the Community Art Center in Cambridge.  They cost $5, and are open to the public--for dancers of all levels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will provide music, mirrors, hard wood floors, and a few fun, welcoming people to get the dancing started!  There will be no organized instruction, so all participants should come ready to learn from and to help each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please continue to check the message board for updates, because we will post any changes or cancellations there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Bonus!! Meet-up Member DJ Rob Suave has generously offered discounted admission to Salsa Sundays at Ryles for all practice participants. When you arrive at the practice, you will simply sign-up on the list and pay $7, and then you can stroll into Ryles that night at any time you'd like! (Please note: sign up will only take place from 4:30-5:30 pm at CAC. Regular Admission to Sundays at Ryles is $10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For directions and parking information, please click here or paste this link into your browser: &lt;a href="http://www.metamovements.com/salsa/Locations.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metamoveme...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Anara (&lt;a href="http://salsa.meetup.com/193/members/2988644/"&gt;http://salsa.meetup.c...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ana Masacote (manager)</member_name><member_id>2622923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542257000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Salsa Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsalsa</urlname><id>278345</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston &amp; Cambridge Salsa Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190941738000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Salsa Meetup Practice</name><id>6442398</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194816600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsalsa/events/6442398/</event_url></item>
