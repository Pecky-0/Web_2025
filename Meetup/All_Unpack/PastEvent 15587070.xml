An assortment of appetizers and main dishes will be offered at each table, so there will be no need to pre-order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time and date are set for Friday December 17 from 11:30 to 1ish.  If you have a scheduling conflict, come a bit late or leave early.  You will still be able to share some of the tasty food and enjoy the company of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a $15 fixed price for food and tea.  If you want a glass of wine or other beverage they will be available on a pay as you go basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought it would be fun to have a raffle, so if anyone can bring an item, gift certificate for services, etc., please do.  The more the merrier as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also be gathering words of encouragement for Nikki Rasmussen of YOLO as she deals with the fire that recently destroyed her business location.  Nikki has been a great supporter of AWBL and has payed it forward to many women in the community.  Please be thinking of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jingling all the way,&lt;br /&gt;Your leadership team &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa </member_name><member_id>9510638</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cheryl Roby</member_name><member_id>10682494</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Janet Carpenter</member_name><member_id>10721723</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292861513000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Association-of-Women-Business-leaders</urlname><id>1543671</id><group_lat>41.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>AWBL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291067902000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December 17th AWBL Holiday Luncheon at Shangri La</name><id>15587070</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292603400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Association-of-Women-Business-leaders/events/15587070/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/e/f/global_19949871.jpeg</photo_url></item>
