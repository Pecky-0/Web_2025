This riotous and touching Tony-nominated musical tells the story of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’ eccentric relatives, Big Edie Beale and her daughter, Little Edie. The two shared a dysfunctional and co-dependent relationship that dragged them from their perch atop high society to a life of squalor and isolation as East Hampton, Long Island’s most notorious recluses. Based on the famous documentary film of the same name, this musical offers theatrical magic: the actress who portrays the mother in the first act takes on the role of the daughter in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I've changed the date to Friday 15th as Saturday sold out already!!
