The mission of Rosie’s Place is to help women maintain their dignity, seek opportunity and find security in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the women Rosie's place assists are working and in housing but simply can’t make ends meet. Some are newly homeless, while others women have been living on the streets for years. We serve women as young as 18 and as old as 80. Approximately one-third of our guests have children"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosie's Place is always in need of the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Clean, in-season women’s clothing, particularly nightgowns, slippers, new underwear, bras and socks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boots in good condition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New regular and travel size toiletries, including shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, lotion, soap, toothpaste and toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Non-perishable food items, particularly canned vegetables and fruits, cereal, peanut butter, pasta, non-refrigerated juices and rice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Bath towels and wash cloths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 New Twin size sheets and blankets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Coffee mugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Children’s books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Buttons and jewelry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Playing cards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lets see what we can find in our closets and donate it on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to go to the drive then let us know, maybe we can meet you somewhere to pick up your donation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Claudette</member_name><member_id>14230550</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1354253679000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353992847000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Donation Drive for Rosie's Place(Women's Clothing)</name><id>92974212</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>3600000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1354233600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/92974212/</event_url></item>
