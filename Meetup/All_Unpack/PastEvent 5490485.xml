This book addresses the issues of human interference with life's natural principles that has resulted in massive environmental, economic, political, and personal imbalance.   This imbalance has created the growth of spiritual interests everywhere, with many people searching for a natural spirituality of respect for all life. They have begun the transition from outer authority to soulful alignment with their internal security. The deeper causes for these conditions are examined in this book. Katharina will offer self-help tools for soul centered healing, and shows how the evolution of human consciousness takes place in cycles of contraction and expansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, many come to the potlucks other than Meetup members, so do not look at the RSVP's to determine if it will be a well attended event!  We do hope you will come and join other like-minded folks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541032000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1171757082000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Indigo Children and Parents March Meetup</name><id>5490485</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174168800000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/5490485/</event_url></item>
