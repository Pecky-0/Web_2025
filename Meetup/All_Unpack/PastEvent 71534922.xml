&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a very brief ride on West Shore Road, we enter Rocky Point.  I am eliminating the Large Hills, we rode in May.  Those in Training, are more than welcome to ride them.  We will do the short, but Beautiful Biking/Walking Path, at Rocky Point.  The Views of the Bay are Gorgeous.  This looks like a Good Place for our Break, at the Beach.  There are Porta Potties here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who want,  can head for more  Shoreline at Conimicut or I can take you to Buttonwoods.  Again, this is a Ride, I am still designing, be patient.   I want to stay near the Coast, because it should be cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of places to go for food, after the Ride.   Some have outdoor seating, for those who transport their Bikes, on the outside of there cars.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>There is a Big Lots, in this Plaza.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave N.</member_name><member_id>10478672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341947610000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341167112000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike the Shores of Warwick</name><id>71534922</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341756000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/71534922/</event_url></item>
