Come climb, meet regulars, new and different climbers, and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that haven't been to BRG before, it has a nice variety, something for everyone, and a friendly community atmosphere.  Pure slab, vertical, and sustained overhanging routes, multiple cracks,&lt;br /&gt;dihedrals for stemming and laybacks, and more, for building many different techniques and strengths.  You can toprope, boulder, and lead.  Let us know what your preferences are.  Leading the ceiling is a ton of fun, straight on or via the dark crystal, that moves!  High quality wall route and boulder problem setting (some of the best on the east coast) for fun and challenge.  From easy juggy speed routes to super hard 5.13 and V10+ problems, you'll find it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet up at 7 PM by the benches in the central TV room/area, to make introductions and team up.  If arriving later, just come find us on the walls. (I'll post what I plan to wear to this page the day&lt;br /&gt;before to help locate us).  I'll likely get to the gym around 6 PM, so if you want to meet and start climbing earlier, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've never climbed there before, you'll need to take &amp;amp; pass a belay test for rope climbing.  Call the gym or see the website below for more info.  Full-acess Day Pass $16.  Bouldering-Only Pass $14.  On Thursdays (I think) students get in for half price.  If interested in regular workouts, I'd recommend checking out membership prices, definitely saves you money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info and directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonrockgym.com/general_info.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonrock...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>9443907</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276278547000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275624589000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BRG Thursday</name><id>13693674</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276210800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/13693674/</event_url></item>
