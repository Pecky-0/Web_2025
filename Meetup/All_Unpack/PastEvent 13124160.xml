Big dance floor, good food and plenty of room. So, that with the fact that Mama Kicks is playing there, and Deb S. would like a nice place to celebrate her birthday, there you go...we're en route for a fun night! Anyone else have a birthday we can celebrate, the more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner we can plan ahead of time, as it's an Italian restaurant. According to tpsscoreboard.com, the restaurant's website, the bands start at 9pm, and of course to check out Mama Kicks music go to mamakicks.com. Please just indicate in your reply, if you'll be dining with us, as they will reserve tables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This location is right off the highway, it took me 40 minutes from Pelham, NH, so it's not too far. &lt;br /&gt;the address is 15 Middlesex Canal Park, Woburn, MA 01801&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're heading to the Castleton that night, then enjoy!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suz&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup signs on the tables</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271633981000</updated><rating><average>2.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
