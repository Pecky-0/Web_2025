If you want to choose the exhibits, you can organize your own event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I'd like to see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ori Gersht &lt;br /&gt;

 History Repeating &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event occurs during Member Guest Days, when members can bring up to four additional guests, beyond what their membership allows. This means I can bring five guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are other members around who can bring guests, let me know and I'll hook you up with someone who needs a ticket. Of course, I encourage you to support the museum, and buying a membership is an excellent way to do so -- you can get into all the Friday night social events, and also go to most other museum functions, and gain free admission any day the museum is open. What a bargain!! Some memberships start to pay for themselves after three admissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular adult admission is $25, but you may also be able to borrow passes from your local library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's meet in the lobby, in front of the statue of Orpheus and Cerberus, and let's go see the exhibitions that I want to see.  Of course, this is still a free country, pending the results of the election, and you can also look at some of the exhibitions you would like to see.  I won't stop you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron R.</member_name><member_id>4515948</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1355496522000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351315517000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MFA - see the exhibits Ron wants to see</name><id>88773092</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1355441400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/88773092/</event_url></item>
