Based on early signups (I know, this is posted way in advance), I'll talk to the business and see what sort of group rates we can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the season I'd like to do an outdoor session, but April weather may be a bit unpredictable still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estimated cost will be $32 at most for admission and rental of gun, mask, paint and co2 cartridges.  Again, if we get enough people, I can get group rates and reduce this cost.  Depending on how long we intend to play, additional paint will likely be necessary. (200 rounds doesn't last long as I recall)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1209402420000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205240280000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indoor Paintball</name><id>7509664</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1209229200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/7509664/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/3/global_3163235.jpeg</photo_url></item>
