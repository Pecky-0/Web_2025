<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>So back in Wisconsin I was a regular at a local cover band - I used to go out dancing every Tuesday night.  And when I talk dancing, I don't mean the skeezy bump and grind, but I mean full-on dancing-home-in-front-of-the-mirror karaaaaazy dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know lots of you can't make the 80s nights because you all need to work in the mornings (I'm with ya!), but I'd like to hear your excuse for why you can't come throw it down on a Friday.  And when I say I'd like to hear your excuse, I don't really mean it - you should be out dancin to all your favorite 90s jams period!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar serves food till 11, too, so if you work up an appetite there'll be plenty to nosh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***note - last time we didn't need to pay a cover cuz we got there early enough, but i'd bring $5 or so for a cover just in case!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>RSVP for details</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245847180000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242361655000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>90s Night at the Common Ground in Allston</name><id>10416971</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245459600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10416971/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/6/global_9108742.jpeg</photo_url></item>
