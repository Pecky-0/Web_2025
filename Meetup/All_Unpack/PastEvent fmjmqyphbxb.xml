<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We will be viewing and discussing a Keylontic Science DVD presentation by Terry Schile called "Introduction to the Monad".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in the accompanying handbook,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Monad is&amp;nbsp;an aspect of our multi-dimensional self that holds direct connection to Source....&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the "spark of the living flame"....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can think of the Modad as the light generator, the energy that comes through the template and brings it to life, and the seed atom as the core template that energy is beamed through.&amp;nbsp; They are both formed of the same intention, and are just two aspects of that intention that are necessary to create a projected, perceivable hologram or reality field."&lt;/p&gt;
