Do you always take &amp;quot;just one more&amp;quot; run? If you answered &amp;#147;yes&amp;#148; to either of these, it may be time for a Wintervention. Narrated by skiing icon Jonny Moseley, Warren Miller&amp;#146;s Wintervention is the definitive solution for the snow-obsessed. Wintervention takes riders like Chris Davenport, Jonny Moseley and Lindsey Vonn on a global tour of Alaska, Norway, Canada, Antarctica and beyond&amp;#133; delivering a successful Wintervention for all of us in need. Warren Miller films attract a cult-like following and mark the official start of winter for sports enthusiasts everywhere. Warren Miller premieres are an experience, a party and a phenomenon not to be missed &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet for drinks and a bite to eat beforehand at 5:00pm at Acapulco's at the Cummings Center in Beverly and then see the film afterwards at Endicott College Auditorium. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acapulcos &lt;br /&gt;900 Cummings Ctr # 101T &lt;br /&gt;Beverly, MA 01915-6196 &lt;br /&gt;(978) 232-0100 &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Showtimes Sunday, November 7, 2010 - 7:00pm  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket Information &lt;br /&gt;(Apparently EMS in Peabody knows nothing of being a ticket source, so I'd skip them as an option to purchase tickets.)&lt;br /&gt;Leighton O'Connor did a little checking for us and tickets are supposed to be $19 at Endicott's box office.&lt;br /&gt;TICKETMASTER online, and the Endicott College box office night of show only.  (Ticket was $28 with shipping and took 2-3 days to arrive-so don't bother with Ticketmaster this if you haven't already got a ticket.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please order your ticket before you RSVP - Yes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather Cowen&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>heather cowen</member_name><member_id>11687483</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289348088000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288035760000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wintervention-Beverly, MA Warren Miller Movie</name><id>15224255</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289174400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/15224255/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/8/global_14726280.jpeg</photo_url></item>
