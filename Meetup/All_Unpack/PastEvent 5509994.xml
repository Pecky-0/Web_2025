I want to plan a garage sale and craft sale to raise money for a medical account for these babies. They are in our group.  I will be talking with my accountant to make sure it is set up as non-taxable money.   I am planning to do this in May or June depending on the groups input... So bring your ideas; a snack or drink to share and the theme for this party is wear your green.. Happy St. Paddy's Party...&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>patty</member_name><member_id>57327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1173805835000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172333838000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March Pug Party</name><id>5509994</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1173632400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/5509994/</event_url></item>
