&lt;p&gt;Distance: 3-4 miles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration: up to 2 hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulty: strenuous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hike is open to all members that are in good physical condition. It is especially geared to the new members as an introduction to the club and what can be expected from hiking with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a great introductory hike planned for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hike will take us through a woodland area that has all the features and beauty of what you can expect from hiking in Rhode Island. There are giant boulders strewn about, babbling brooks, rocky outcroppings and stone walls everywhere. There is an abandoned farm site and of course the mysterious cairns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm rating this hike as strenuous due to the many hills we will encounter. The terrain will vary from soft packed trail to rock hopping up and down hills and over small streams.&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/5/4/event_188907732.jpeg" width="269" height="184" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; I'll be planning my own route which will incorporate both blue loop trails along with the yellow connecting trail. With this route we will be seeing most of the sights from both loops but without doing the whole 7+ miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good hiking boots as well as plenty of extra water carried along will be required for this hike. Please read the Rhode Island Hiking Club's liability waiver and understand that it applies to this and all hikes with the club and is a condition of your participation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meet in the lot</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>michael</member_name><member_id>8899394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1367770967000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RhodeIslandhikingclub</urlname><id>1527097</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Hiking Club        " Walks and Rambles "</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1367422804000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hi, Welcome to your club!</name><id>117153912</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1367674200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RhodeIslandhikingclub/events/117153912/</event_url></item>
