&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What are we doing?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a small group of fast hikers to hike the entire Kilkenny Ridge in a day. This includes two 4K peaks (Cabot and Waumbek) and a bunch of NE 100 highest peaks (Bulge, Horn, the Weeks). &amp;nbsp;This isn't really a peak-bagging trip - if you need these peaks, there are much easier ways to get them! This hike is geared towards people who enjoy long, fast day hikes and are looking for a physical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 6:00 am at the Starr King Trailhead (at the end of Starr King Rd) off Route 2 in Jefferson, NH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Trip Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;On this 
&lt;strong&gt;moderate/fast-paced&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;one-way trip we will&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;hike about&amp;nbsp;21.5 miles&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;strong&gt;climb about 7,300 feet&lt;/strong&gt;. Book time is nearly 16 hours - but our plan/goal is to hike faster than book time and finish in 13-14 hours. This trip is considered to be &amp;nbsp; 
&lt;strong&gt;ADVANCED+/EXTREME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain&lt;/strong&gt;. Between the hiking and the car spots, this will be a LONG day - and you should be prepared to hike out in the dark if we run behind schedule. &amp;nbsp;You may want to stay over/camp the night before and/or the night after.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spotting cars at the Starr King trailhead, we'll drive to the Berlin Fish Hatchery and begin our hike at the southern end of the Unknown Pond Trail. We'll take the Unknown Pond Trail up to the Kilkenny Ridge trail, and pass the Bulge and the Horn, before reaching Cabot. We'll continue on the Kilkenny Ridge trail for miles and miles past Terrace and over the Weeks before getting to Mt. Waumbek. From there, we'll take the Starr King trail down over Mt. Starr King and back to our cars near Route 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have hiked many sections of this route, the section over the Weeks will be new to us. While we have researched this trip, we expect all participants to bring a map, and be familiar with the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;To sign up for this hike, you should be an experienced hiker who has recently completed trips of similar distance and elevation - faster than book time. Please answer all RSVP questions - if we haven't hiked with you before, you may also be contacted by meet up organizers to further elaborate on your preparation/experience.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two before this event.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;/strong&gt;
