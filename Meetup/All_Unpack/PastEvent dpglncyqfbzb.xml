&lt;p&gt;Just a quick summary of the last meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed any challenges you were having meeting your goals. This will be an ongoing theme through all the meetings and if you find yourself in need of help - moral support or ideas- please you let the group know at the beginning of the meetings and we'll make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you did not send me your goal sheet please do so by Sunday the 26th. Because sharing it with all of us will help us hold you accountable to the ideas and goals you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not be doing this at every meeting. I would like to spend time actually discussing your projects in the future meetings. So at the last meeting we decided that everyone will make a print from their projects and bring it along to the meeting. We will discuss these prints and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also asked you to come with ideas on ways to reward yourself for completing your goals. Please be prepared to share these with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice work everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is quite a bit of time between these meetings. So I am hoping you will ask yourself each week and maybe each day- "What can I do to reach at least one of my goals today?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's stay focused and on task. 2012 is they year to make things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
