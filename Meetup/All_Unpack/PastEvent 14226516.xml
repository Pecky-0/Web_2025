A donation of $10 gets you an admission sticker and map to other WH eateries participating in the event. Each offers a drink, dinner or appetizer special so you can have a moveable feast and sample new eateries in the name of a good cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proceeds raised at the Charity Tastes N' Toasts event on August 11th will help support Foodshare's vision of creating a community where hunger is universally unacceptable and where businesses, organizations, and individuals work together to ensure that everyone has access to good, nutritious food.   Foodshare serves as our regionâ€™s food bank and distributes 16 tons of food each day to a network of nearly 350 local partners that feed our hungry neighbors. Every $30 that Foodshare receives provides enough food for a hungry person for an entire month and 94% of Foodshare's resources go directly to ending hunger.  More info on their FB page:  &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=128117183897723" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.c...&lt;/a&gt;   There is a page on the Blue Back Square site but it still has the July dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a weekly event sponsored by the Blue Back Square restaurants.  Each week a different restaurant hosts a different charity.  The host restaurant offers the opportunity to learn about the specific charity benefited by the day's activities through an educational display within the restaurant.  Since I volunteer for Foodshare, I have information about this event and thought it sounds like fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set the start time as 6:30pm because I don't get out of work in time for the 5:00pm opening.  I'll try to get to Flemings a little before 6:30pm so we can meet and then decide as a group what sounds most interesting:  Moveable feast with appetizer at one location and main course at another?  Or just one restaurant for the evening?&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margo Lynn</member_name><member_id>513710</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281648847000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280230476000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Night Tastes N' Toasts at Blue Back Square - August 11th</name><id>14226516</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281565800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/14226516/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/1/5/global_3916629.jpeg</photo_url></item>
