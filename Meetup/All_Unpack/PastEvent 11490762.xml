The walk will start at the entrance to the Storer Conservation Land before you get to the High School. Watch for WLT signs and activity as you drive up the road to the high school. There is parking along this road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana will then explore the newest part of the Chester Brook trail on the land between Waltham High School and the Kennedy Middle School. In the last couple of years Waltham Land Trust members have worked to make this trail accessible. (I helped build one of the bridges)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This walk is part of a series to introduce the trails that are part of the Western Greenway, a comprehensive nine-mile trail plan to link open spaces from Belmont to Lexington, with a loop through Waltham that will eventually connect with a future rail trail.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>15</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255482232000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254170501000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Chesterbrook Woods - Waltham</name><id>11490762</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255280400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/11490762/</event_url></item>
