As of now (late Thursday night) we seem to be a go for a 6:50pm showing according to the Kendall Square website.  I have removed the maybes from the RSVPs in accordance with our groups policy of removing maybes within 3 days of the event and as per my previous mention of same (so legalease ..eh!).  Those that were &amp;quot;maybes&amp;quot; can change to &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; on their own.  The limit is now 24!   We seem to have a fair amount of folks so we will probably go with 2 or 3 tables for the post movie discussion.  I am closing responses by 9am Saturday so I can make the proper reservation. If you can't make it..change to a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; ASAP.   This is a happenin movie and lots of cool people are coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), life catering to suburban blue-hairs at the local regional theater in Schenectady, New York is looking bleak. His wife (Catherine Keener) has left him to pursue her painting in Berlin. His therapist (Hope Davis) is better at plugging her best-seller than she is at counseling him. A new relationship with the alluringly candid Hazel (Samantha Morton) has prematurely run aground. And a mysterious condition is systematically shutting down each of his autonomic functions, one by one. Worried about the transience of his life, he leaves his home behind. He gathers an ensemble cast into a warehouse in New York City, hoping to create a work of brutal honesty. Co-starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michelle Williams, Tom Noonan, Emily Watson and Dianne Wiest. Written and directed by Charlie Kaufman, screenwriter of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go to Cambridge Brewing Company afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At the END of the movie, upfront, right side of the screen  w/ Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Frank</member_name><member_id>4007722</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1229384992000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228082459000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Synecdoche, New York</name><id>9252640</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1229211900000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/9252640/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/1/3/global_6475043.jpeg</photo_url></item>
