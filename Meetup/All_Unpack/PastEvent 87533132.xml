Since it's construction, this old barn has been home to many different businesses including Worthen Manufacturing, a manufacturer of carriages back in the mid-1800's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveniently located near the Pow Wow River Walk. Parking is available on the Water Street parking deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a great menu that has a little bit of everything on it.  Check out their menu here:    &lt;a href="http://www.thebarnpub.com/barn2011.pdf"&gt;http://www.thebarnpub.com/barn2011.pdf&lt;/a&gt; and their Gluten Free menu here:   &lt;a href="http://www.thebarnpub.com/glutenfreemenu2011.pdf"&gt;http://www.thebarnpub.com/glutenfreemenu2011.pdf&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
