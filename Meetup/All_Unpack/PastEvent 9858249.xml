For those unfamiliar, JiffyCon is a organized one-day gaming meetup for the purpose of hanging out, meeting new folks and playing fun games! Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What: JiffyCon Boston&lt;br /&gt;When: Saturday, March 21st, 9am-7pm&lt;br /&gt;Where: Unity Church of God, Somerville, MA&lt;br /&gt;Cost: 10$ admission, covering cost of space rental, snacks and a pizza lunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need events! If you are interested in running a game, please email me (n.d.paoletta@gmail.com) with the event title, a short descriptive blurb, the number of players you can handle, and whether you prefer the morning (9.30-1) or afternoon (2-6) slot. Events will go up on the website as they are received. JiffyCon is historically slanted towards small-press and independently published games, but we've also had sessions of D&amp;amp;D, Traveller, and other &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; games, so feel free to submit anything you want to run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preregistration! You may preregister in order to ensure a slot in games that you really want to play - and it helps us out by giving a rough head count for food purposes. Preregister by sending me an email with your name and the game(s) you wish to register for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details (including directions to the venue and a list of events submitted) are available at the website: jiffycon.com. Feel free to send me or Dev (dev.purkayastha@gmail.com) an email if you have any addition questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christian Loidl</member_name><member_id>1035154</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238023415000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235982485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>JiffyCon</name><id>9858249</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1237640400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/9858249/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/global_3081279.jpeg</photo_url></item>
