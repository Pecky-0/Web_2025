If you get there early enough? If you will allow him too? Steve Ob1. will do his best, to make sure you are introduce to as many people as he can.  Therefore as always, If you attend one of Steve Ob1. events? You will not be able to say."I did not meet anyone."  Plus, seats and tables will be hard to hold without a body in them. So, please join us as close to 8 as you can. The doors open at 7:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is complimentary parking in the Crowne Plaza garage.  But, you need to have your parking stubs validated as you pay at the door to the Dance, or the hotel front desk. Do this on arrival instead of the end of dance... It works better for all that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul, who puts on this dance, has his own meetup group, SuperSingles(TM),&lt;/p&gt;
