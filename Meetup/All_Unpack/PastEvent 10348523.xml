In Rio's underbelly, home of pimps, prostitutes, and other misfits, director Karim Ainouz tells a story of desperate dreams that transcend poverty and squalor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free and open to the public. Screened with subtitles in English. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date: Tuesday, May 12, 2009&lt;br /&gt;Time: 6:00 - 8:00 pm&lt;br /&gt;Location: CGIS South, Tsai Auditorium, 1730 Cambridge Street, Cambridge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/brazil/events/madamesata" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drclas.harvard.edu/brazil/events/madamesata" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.drclas.har...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be seated at the high tables downstairs, wearing an amarelo tshirt - Tonya</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tonya</member_name><member_id>3389565</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joana</member_name><member_id>4876115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1242606041000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Portuguese Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>portuguese-316</urlname><id>454600</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston/Cambridge Portuguese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241581424000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Another Free Brazilian Movie!!
