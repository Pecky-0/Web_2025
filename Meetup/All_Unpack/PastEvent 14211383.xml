Having completed her MFA at the Yale School of Music, she will be giving one final performance at the Neighborhood Music School this Saturday, July 31st, before leaving us to pursue her doctorate at the University of Michigan. Having been fortunate enough to have heard her sing before, I can not recommend strongly enough that you come and join us for this performance. There is an article in today's New Haven Register about Tiffany's life and impressive accomplishments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newhavenregister.com/articles/2010/07/25/entertainment/doc4c4b872a463c1492678060.txt" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newhavenre...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further incentive to come out is that, in addition to accompanyment from pianists Joel Martin and Rex Cadwallader and guitarist Myron Radawiec, Tiffany will also be accompanied by the NHC's very own amazing concert pianist Alexis Zingale! This should really be a fantastic show and a great time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;This recital is a fundraiser for Tiffany's doctoral pursuit. My sincere apologies for the earlier incorrect posting saying it was free.&lt;/span&gt; The suggested donation is $50, but they welcome and appreciate whatever support individuals are able to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we'll most likely do the tradional post-performance socializing over food and drinks at nearby Anna Liffey's, located at 17 Whitney Avenue. Please come out and join us for a wonderful evening!&lt;br /&gt;-Neil&lt;br /&gt;203-645-2008&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280801514000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280107552000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Opera star's final local recital &amp; Alexis on piano</name><id>14211383</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280619000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/14211383/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/a/global_351658.jpeg</photo_url></item>
