Whether you are the designer, the developer or both, Catalyst can quickly and painlessly (relatively speaking) create components from Photoshop, Illustrator or Fireworks files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny Savage will give present a project, starting in Photoshop, bringing it into Flash Catalyst and then onto Flex;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agenda&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Presentation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Social time:&lt;/b&gt;  There have been a few requests to have a bit of a party (tis the season).  Please feel free (but by no means obligated) to bring some refreshment such as an appetizer or dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prize giveaways&lt;/b&gt;!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We shall be giving away books, tshirts, software, software, software, swag and other goodies, as well as the grand prize of the Adobe software raffle (winner may choose which suite or package, not including the Master Collection).  You must be present to be eligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little side note:There are a number of members who don't RSVP to the meetup (or even know about Meetup.com), they just come.  So don't be discouraged if there is a low number of RSVPs saying yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Webster Hall, Room 106</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Penny Savage</member_name><member_id>10532962</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261264546000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ManchesterAUG</urlname><id>1532602</id><group_lat>42.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>Manchester Adobe User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260892947000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December Meeting</name><id>12089422</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261090800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ManchesterAUG/events/12089422/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/8/0/global_12259408.jpeg</photo_url></item>
