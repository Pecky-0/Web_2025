Players will play high officers at the Imperial court and try to outdo one another with kung-fu treachery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the March (kinda) installment of our series of one-shot RPG experiences to be offered monthly over the course of 2011.  Each month will feature a different GM running a new game.  This month's GM is Tewhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a game on your shelf that you've been itching to run, but your regular group just isn't interested?  Why not run it for us at the Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston!  We want to continue running one-shot games throughout 2011, and you can help!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the table with a mysterious silk handkerchief</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tewhill</member_name><member_id>3431516</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301764602000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Action packed Wuxia action!</why><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston</urlname><id>359705</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Role-Playing Fellowship of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1299202291000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>March (kinda) One-Shot - Mist Robed Gate</name><id>16790456</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301760000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/roleplaying-fellowship-of-greater-boston/events/16790456/</event_url></item>
