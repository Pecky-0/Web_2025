This is will be a self help bathing session, so we'll do the washing and cleaning and nail cutting, you do the drying and brushing. The rate will be $20.00 per dog, and it should be a fun time to have the group involved in the process! We'll need to know how many pugs will be participating, so if you could just shoot an e-mail to robgaleski@doggieday.com, we'll be able to plan accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jen</member_name><member_id>2407140</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>22</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1141657458000</updated><rating><average>4.55000019073</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Pug Devotee Extraordinaires</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-73</urlname><id>126274</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Pug Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>42</yes_rsvp_count><created>1139068997000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Pug March Meetup</name><id>4847256</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1141484400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-73/events/4847256/</event_url></item>
