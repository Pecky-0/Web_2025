<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Terminal 110 was awesome the last time around. We had a huge turn out (about 20) and lots of fun. Music was great and the after hours Denny's was perfect. The last time we had an event at Terminal 110 it was my first time there and i was really impressed. No drama at the club, DJ was awesome, Bar staff were great, and a big mixed crowd overall.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's go out and have a great night. Terminal 110, Friday Night June 17....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6/15/2011) Car Pool: Just a thought, Would car pooling be a good idea for some in the Hartford area to attend Terminal 110 Friday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6/10/2011) UPDATE: Thanks to one of our members, Ashley Violette, we got some perks on the night of Terminal 110. So far it seems the owner of Terminal 110 will be offering VIP treatment,&amp;nbsp;Table upstairs,&amp;nbsp;No cover charge, And maybe some free drinks... Also Sugar Hill Gang will be performing that night so this should be a crazy night. So lets have a good time. We had about 18 people show up last april, my target is 20!!! SO LET'S DO THIS!!!!...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
