I thought it appropriate because Ghandi is an example of a person so focused on his mission that he had a huge effect on the world. (Catered Indian food too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the details....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there, &lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TITLE: 100th Anniversary of Gandhi's Mission for Peace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 11th, 1906, Mohandas K. Gandhi launched the modern non-violence movement in his quest for justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 11th, 2001, that quest was challenged with the World Trade Center attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this 100th anniversary of Ghandi?s revolutionary cause, we have a choice to linger in the loss or resurrect the momentum of his radical mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This September 11th, join THE CENTER OF LIGHT~ BOSTON at Jimmy Tingle?s Off Broadway Theater at 255 Elm Street, Davis Square, Somerville for a dinner reception and fund-raiser in support of the modern-day peace movement.
