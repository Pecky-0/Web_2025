We'll be able to have a more private setting there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting will be back to our regular format of bringing images to share and general photography discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring drinks or food for yourselves as this space doesn't have a resturant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring any new work you'd like to share and discuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to see so many new faces at the last meetup. I look foward to seeing you at the next meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott Erb</member_name><member_id>762115</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1152837100000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Photography August Meetup</name><id>5023126</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1155252600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/5023126/</event_url></item>
