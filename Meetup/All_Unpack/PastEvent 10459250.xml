My plan is to get there around 4pm and stay until about 7pm.  So feel free to drop in anytime.  I thought we could walk around 6pm - short walk around the Pond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect weather for hanging out at the beach or a walk around the pond.   Look for myself  near the changing room in the beach area in the shade. My cell is 508-472-7900.
