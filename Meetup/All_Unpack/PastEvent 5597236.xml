Ethan is the premier promotor of &amp;quot;velomobiles&amp;quot; in Maine. What is a velomobile? That's Ethan in his &amp;quot;Mango&amp;quot; you may have seen on our home page, and you can find the definition and more details at his website, &lt;a href="http://www.velomobiles.net" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.velomobile...&lt;/a&gt;. Then come to our July meetup on Thursday 7/19 and try one out in person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   While we take turns trying out the futuristic wheels, Ethan will give us the lowdown on velomobiles: their features and benefits, the outlook for manufacturing possibilities in North America, and ElectroVelo Rally and Competition he participated in at Beech Ridge Motor Speedway in May. Come and experience this interesting design direction for human powered vehicles with Ethan and the Portland Bicycle Commuting Meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[*** NOTE: DIFFERENT DAY THAN USUAL! Also, we had formerly scheduled the topic &amp;quot;Traffic Safety&amp;quot; for this month. That will now be rescheduled for a later date, probably September]&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1185059121000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Bike Commuters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Portland-Bike-Commuting</urlname><id>225788</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Bicycle Commuting</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174644886000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Velomobile Demo and Discussion</name><id>5597236</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1184886000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Bike-Commuting/events/5597236/</event_url></item>
