The general manager gave out bags that give you 15% off for anything you can fit in them. The folks at GBM are really into what we are doing. It's a perfect place for a scooter club to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had 8 Scooterists at the last event, I'm hoping we can double that this time at this convenient location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 6 PM and then at 7 when GBM closes we will head down to Blue Ribbon BBQ (just down the street) for dinner. This event is FREE and open to all members and scooters alike, please no cars :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254658699000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254284983000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Scooter Night at Greater Boston Motorsports</name><id>11505758</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254434400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/11505758/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/a/global_10106570.jpeg</photo_url></item>
