After about one mile, turn left onto Monsen Road. Continue on Monsen Road until you see the refuge entrance on your left. Drive slowly and look for a small sign, the entrance is between 2 homes and can easily be mistaken for a driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a ride? Please ask for one in your rsvp, saying what area you are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This original 250-acre area that belonged to Samuel Hoar is still known as the ?Great Meadows,? and is open to visitors. Several trails are available for wildlife observation, including the Dike Trail, a 2.7-mile loop around one of the marsh pools. Trailside interpretive signs and an observation tower provide visitors with additional views and information about the refuge, its management, and its wildlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch afterwards at Cafe Luigi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://luigisbedford.com/lunch.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://luigisbedford....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;152 Great Rd # 2&lt;br /&gt;Bedford, MA 01730&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(781) 271-0666&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219070146000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218331911000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Great Meadows walk </name><id>8512476</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218897000000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/8512476/</event_url></item>
