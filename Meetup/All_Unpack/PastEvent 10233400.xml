We will have a panel of individuals representing various pieces of the educational &amp;quot;puzzle&amp;quot; including administration, classroom teachers, as well as PTO and School Committee representation. This is not intended to be a town specific forum, but rather a talk about how to get the most out of the process for your children's benefit in any town. There may, however, be opportunities to address town specific questions as well depending on the interest of the group and the availabilty of panel members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is a &amp;quot;moms only&amp;quot; event, potential members are welcome to attend! (Non-mobile infants are welcome to attend.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other events will be held in April-August (available to paid members only due to insurance liability policy requirements.) Annual dues to Mothers &amp;amp; More, a national non-profit organization, are $45. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom and Kids Lunch at Bugaboo Creek &lt;br /&gt;See the Big Trucks at the Framingham DPW truck lot &lt;br /&gt;Southwick Zoo Trip &lt;br /&gt;Tour of Whole Foods &lt;br /&gt;Berry Picking &lt;br /&gt;Ice Cream at Gerards &lt;br /&gt;Family Baseball Night -watch the Lowell Spinners &lt;br /&gt;Davis Farmland and Splashpad Visit &lt;br /&gt;Ice Skating &lt;br /&gt;Family Cookout &lt;br /&gt;Hopkinton State Park Beach day &lt;br /&gt;Water Fun Sprinkler/Slide/Wading Pool party &lt;br /&gt;Playground Drop-ins at designated Parks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Other events that Mothers &amp;amp; More offers- Movie Mamas monthly movie night at the AMC Framingham, Book Group, Cooking Group, Unfinished Object Night (scrapbooking, knitting, general projects on your to-do list.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanya</member_name><member_id>7153030</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243469679000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Moms</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mothers-and-more-metrowest</urlname><id>1284421</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Mothers &amp; More MetroWest Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240323423000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>School Panel</name><id>10233400</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241047800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mothers-and-more-metrowest/events/10233400/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/1/b/global_5549403.jpeg</photo_url></item>
