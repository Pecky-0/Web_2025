I would like to make this a collective brunch and let me know what you could bring!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be making &lt;br /&gt;Baked French toast&lt;br /&gt;Coffee and Tea..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My house is a 6 minute walk from the Forest Hills Stop on the orange line.  I will post directions later.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Heat is on!!  The convention is happening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not able to come to this one and are interested in these discussions, I would love to hear your thoughts for the next one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;There's something going on in the country right now. Many more people are engaged in the presidential election than in decades. People say this is the most interesting and engaged election they've experienced in their lifetime. At the same time, more and more of the American people  nationally, 35-40%  are calling themselves &amp;quot;independent.&amp;quot; Here in &lt;b&gt;MASS 49%&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of our voters&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;are registered independent&lt;/b&gt;. And now, independents are getting organized! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are looking to do these casual conversations every month. So, if you can't make this one, please let me know if you would be opened to another one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My cell is 617 429-9168</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane</member_name><member_id>4305566</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222560556000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fellow Foodies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brunchclub-107</urlname><id>273555</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, &amp; Dinner Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219728894000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's Talk Independently:  at  Brunch </name><id>8622505</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221406200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/events/8622505/</event_url></item>
