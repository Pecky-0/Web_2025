<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's meet at Cambridge Common, located near Harvard Square on Mass Ave. For a map of the park in relation to Harvard Square, &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=cambridge+common" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 4:00 on Saturday and throw the ball around while getting to know each others' names. After getting a little warmed up we'll get a game going! Check our About Us page for a list of game rules as well as clarification on some of the rules we've bent to make the game more accommodating for all players. If people are flexible with their time we can get some ice cream or grab drinks afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who take public transportation, the Harvard T stop and the 66 bus stop are a couple blocks away (see the map). Since we're meeting on Saturday, meters will be in full effect. &lt;a href="http://img371.imageshack.us/img371/8397/parkingfd7.gif" target="_blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for a map of metered locations.
