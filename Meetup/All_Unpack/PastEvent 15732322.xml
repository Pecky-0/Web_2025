We'll continue our discussion after watching another segment of Deepak Chopra. All ideas are welcome and if anyone has been reading anything insightful we'd love you to bring it in.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm grateful to be able to get together with a great group of people who are intentionally going to pave the outcome of what they want in life. This is what leads to happiness... :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year and look forward to seeing everyone Wednesday night! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caryn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Location is the same and new people will be sent directions. A small fee ($2-3) is collected to help cover costs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryn treister</member_name><member_id>10881211</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Clement</member_name><member_id>12646664</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295484513000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>MegaMagnets</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PLOAConnection</urlname><id>1426391</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Laws of Attraction Connection</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292352751000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Law of Attraction</name><id>15732322</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295479800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PLOAConnection/events/15732322/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/6/1/global_19547217.jpeg</photo_url></item>
