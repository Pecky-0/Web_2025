For most dreams of this kind, it will be enough to interpret dream characters that represent sides of ourselves. Surreal narratives and strange powers can seem otherworldly, but in fact are often symbolic of our physical, emotional, and intellectual lives here on Earth. Then occasionally, a dream may reach beyond this world to the afterlife and higher realms, where the spirits of departed loved ones and the wisdom of discarnate human teachers can further energize and englighten our paths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what of the stories and legends of magical encounters? From angels to aliens, devas to demons, met in various states of altered consciousness including but not limited to our night dreams, should we chalk them all up to the many forms of human imagination? What of gods and  goddesses, muses and nature spirits? Gnomes of the earth, undines of the water, sylphs of the air, and salamanders of fire? The Faeries of Ireland, the Peris of Persia, and the musician Gandharvas and dancing Apsaras of India?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this special Spring meetup for the very merry month of May, we will examine the possibilities for knowing when a dream character may be a side of yourself, another human (however evolved), or a non-human entity. Do you know the differences between a thoughtform (tulpa), an elemental, a deva, and a fairy? Do you know the connection between fairy myths and alien abductions, and how fears and ignorance can distort an otherwise beneficial contact between worlds? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be advised that this is certainly an area ripe with sensational mythology and popular fears, but that will not be our goal. Talk leaders Deerheart and Carl Schroeder have had their share of fantastical dreams, and with a sense of joyful possibilities will present examples of magical beings and the functions they hold. We'll review basic terminology concerning the planes of existence and subtle bodies (as collected by Theosophy from various esoteric traditions), and offer a reasonable classification system for the wee to the wonderous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel welcome to bring your own examples for discussion and analysis, of unusual dream encounters both dark and light, that reveal more magical sides to this greater universe that we all share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also invite you to tell us about what kind of art, music, nature settings and expressive experiences have worked for you to connect with magical beings, for indeed many are to be found in the joyful energies of creation. Deerheart has brought back water spirits into his dreams from the dance community. Carl met a centaur (one form of a Gandharva) after feeling a heart opening from the 1969 classic dreaming song &amp;quot;Light Flight&amp;quot; from Pentangle, check out the cosmic lyrics &lt;a href="http://www.justsomelyrics.com/1914197/The-Pentangle-Light-Flight-Lyrics" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.justsomelyrics.com/1914197/The-Pentangle-Light-Flight-Lyrics" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.justsomely...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a so-so sampling at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFOeZn20aGE" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFOeZn20aGE" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carl Schroeder&lt;/b&gt; is an engineer by trade and a mystic at heart.
