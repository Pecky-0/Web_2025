Whether you are an experienced drummer or just starting out, there is space for you in our circle.  And what would a circle be without dancers?  So come and join us for this joyous celebration of life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month I'm out of town, so our faithful assistant organizer Joe will be running the circle (Thanks Joe!).  The First Parish of Malden will also be running their Community Cookout and Justice Fair at the same time, so we'll have the opportunity if we like to bring our drums outside to share the rhythm with the festival goers.  We will meet as usual in the basement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:00pm Beginner's Class&lt;/b&gt; - Are you new to drumming?  No problem!  We'll have a beginner's class available just before the actual drumming begins.  Come out and learn the basics of good drumming form.  We'll learn a couple of very basic Native American rhythms, how to find the beat in the circle, and the etiquette of the drum circle so that we can all be good drumming citizens.   Class is free - donation is appreciated.  Bring your drum if you have one, if not, there will be drums to loan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:30pm The Sacred Drum Circle&lt;/b&gt; - Each month we'll cover a different aspect of the drum circle.  Learn about the energy of the drums, the interaction of the drummers and the dancers, how to use the energy of the circle to shift things in your life, and more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setting the Space &lt;/b&gt;- Together we will create an altar that sets the tone for the circle for the day.  Bring with you something to place on the altar that represents you.  We'll create that container together.  This month we focus on looking back.  In many traditions (Celtic and Wican people with Samhain, Mexicans with Day of the Dead, Native American with the turning to the fall sacred direction in the west, where the ancestors are) October is the month to honor, remember, and thank the Ancestors. We remember those who came before us and gave us the gift of life, and some of whom watch over us from the Spirit World.  Bring a picture or remembrance of you ancestors to place on the altar.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3:00pm Open Drumming &lt;/b&gt; - Bring your drums, rattles, Native American flutes, digeridoos, etc.  We will open up the room and get it rocking with the rhythms.  There will be space made for both heart-pounding beats and softer rhythms with room for voices and instruments.  There will be some instruments available for borrow, but it would be best in the beginning if everyone brings what they have so we are certain to have enough to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:30pm Mid-Circle Break&lt;/b&gt; - We'll take a break at roughly the half-way mark to allow people to introduce themselves and say what they bring to the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6:00pm - Closing Circle&lt;/b&gt; - We'll close the space as we opened it with a circling up of the participants and a closing of the energy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost: &lt;/b&gt; Guess What?  After months of searching, we found a venue so happy to have us there that they are not charging us for the space.  &lt;b&gt;So, that means the event is FREE.  (YAY!!)&lt;/b&gt;  We will put out a donation basket for those who choose to contribute.  (Suggested Donation is $7, but give what you can.) Donations will go to cover the costs of maintaining this meetup group, obtaining and repairing instruments, and the costs of electricity and heat for the church.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you have instruments to share, please bring them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've gotten a lot of new people involved in drumming and not many of them have their own drums yet.  So if you have extra drums, rattles and the like that you're willing to share, please bring them with you to the circle.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The First Parish in Malden, a Unitarian Universalist congregation, is located three blocks west of the Malden Center T station at 2 Elm Street (intersection with Pleasant Street), just off Route 60. Convenient, free parking is available between the church and the Beebe Elementary School. Visit MaldenUUA.org for directions and map. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We run this event once each month on the third Sunday of the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I look forward to seeing you all there!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe</member_name><member_id>9541111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256248339000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Rhythm Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-drum-circle</urlname><id>617617</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254786700000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Drum and Dance October Meetup</name><id>11556819</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255888800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-drum-circle/events/11556819/</event_url></item>
