The trail is mostly flat with a few small hills and a small section of rocky trail. Mostly and easy walk. Lovely pond with a beach area. Wear good walking shoes, bring water and perhaps a towel for wet dogs....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at Fisherman's Beach on Randolph St in Canton. The entrance to the parking lot is on Randolph Street, left after the temple (coming from the highway) or on the right after the horsefarm (coming from Randolph). Don't park in front of the fire gate directly across from the horsefarm, that is the AMC entrance.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park and walk down toward the pond, there is a sign board just before the beach I will be there</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jacqueline </member_name><member_id>7535746</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289236573000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287366520000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday at Ponkapoag Pond</name><id>15141999</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289142000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/15141999/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/6/9/global_9046201.jpeg</photo_url></item>
