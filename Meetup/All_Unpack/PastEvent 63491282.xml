Anyway- if I am in town tomorrow (will know by 10 AM) is anyone interested in taking a walk at Maudslay from 1-3?  Please bring a dollar to contribute to our meetup group fees, and a dollar (or two...but I think it's $1) for the parking meter at Maudslay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping the rain hasn't left the trails too muddy, but don't anticipate any real issue.  The paths are typically level and well-cleared here- a mix of gravel, dirt, and some packed meadow trails.  There are usually a couple very short inclines- like stepping up from one trail to another or something, but these are really very easy walking trails...sneakers tend to suffice just fine.  My standard disclaimer: any walk with me is typically an "exploration" walk.  i have been to Maudslay a few times, but wouldn't say I know it like the back of my hand.  So, it's possible we may get turned around or take a new route.  that being said, it is not the sort of park we are likely to stay lost in very long!  My goal is to walk the river trail and the Mtn Laurel trail...although I know some parts may be closed off for the eagle nesting.  Anyhow, it's a pretty park, and the weather looks great, so let's get out for a couple hours and enjoy it!  I tend to walk pretty quickly- or so I'm told- perhaps 18-20 min/mile, so we'll probably cover a few miles...plan on 1.5-2 hrs.  I have to be back at the cars at 3 PM, so we'll aim for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!  I'll wait at the edge of the parking lot.  Please leave plenty of time for finding Maudslay...we'll step off promptly at noon. &lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marilee </member_name><member_id>6596076</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336347980000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers</urlname><id>1336846</id><group_lat>42.5</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8700027466</group_lon><name>North Shore Not Too Intense Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336180875000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>We're on for Maudslay but note earlier time</name><id>63491282</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336233600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/North-Shore-Not-Too-Intense-Hikers/events/63491282/</event_url></item>
