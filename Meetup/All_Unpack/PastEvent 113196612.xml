&lt;p&gt;Join us after work for our first PGN social event. We'll relax, share stories about our current journeys, get ideas, talk of our goals, and maybe do an introductory process or two.  We'll drink, laugh, eat, and learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 is casual talk and refreshments. 7:00 we'll do a process or two. 7:30 we'll eat. 8:30 we've paid, tipped well, and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ask for a $1 donation when you come.  You'll pay your own food and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great place to bring your friends and family and just relax with other people who share your passion for creating the life you really want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Topic: Where is your "edge" currently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal growth requires pushing up against the edge of your comfort zone.  That edge can be uncomfortable and scary, but it's where your richest work takes place.  If you can push beyond the fear, beyond the uncertainty, beyond the discomfort of your edge without throwing in the towel, you can get to real gold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What comfort zone do you notice limiting your success today? Are you tired of it? Are you ready to pass beyond it?  What would you, your loved ones, and the people around you reap if you were able to pass beyond your "edge"?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note: It is fine to bring brochures of workshops to share (with *willing* listeners!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note: Responsible drinking is acceptable at this particular social event. (Other PGN social events vary on alcohol policy. Please check with other social event organizers.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
