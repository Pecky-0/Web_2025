We will stop for lunch at the tip and admire the views of Plymouth Harbor, Duxbury Bay, Saquish,  Gurnet Point and Bug Light.   Bring binoculars if you are interested in bird watching as the peninsula is a bird haven and is one of Mass Audubon's Important Bird Areas.  There is also an osprey nest which we will stop to observe on the return back. Sorry no dogs allowed on this walk, as the town has prohibited them on the outer half of the beach during nesting season, leash or no leash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to walk in loose sand at certain ponts of the walk. The hike will be 5+ miles and casually paced with many photo opportunities. Low tide is at 11:17.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Click the address for a map. Meet at the northern end of parking lot.
