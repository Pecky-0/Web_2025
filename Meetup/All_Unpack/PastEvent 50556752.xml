Peace is defined as freedom from disturbance; quiet and tranquility. It is a word used very often but a state of being yet misunderstood. In order to know peace, you must know and understand yourself &amp;ndash; and that is an understanding many do not have. During this seminar, you will be introduced to the way to come into a real state of peace that will unfold you into the person you know you can be. Calm, centered, alert and alive. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait another day, it&amp;rsquo;s too important. Suggested Donation: $25 (Bring a Friend for Free) &lt;br /&gt;
