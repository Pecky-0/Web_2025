We will have already done a car spot Sat night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dogs are Welcome!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike is best for hikers who can hike faster than booktime for extend distances with limited short breaks. It is expected that participants will hike or trail run at their own pace and regroup at several pre-identified spots along the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike is @ 22 miles in distance and summits 5 of the NH48 peaks. Book time is @ 12 - 13 hours. We hope to finish in @ 11 hours. Stops will be short.
