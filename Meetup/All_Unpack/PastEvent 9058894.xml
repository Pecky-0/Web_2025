Come and meet her and learn!&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;FEAR: Why We Are Afraid &amp;amp; the Path to Fearlessness&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, October 30 â€¢ 7:30 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world of self confidence, clarity, and peacefulness how does fear creep in so easily? It is the seed of anger, confusion, and war. Fear creatively gets us to think we are helpless, alone, isolated, and cut off.  But when the truth comes in you know differently; come to this seminar and learn to fearlessly walk the way of freedom from all that has held you from becoming your self.  &lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;about Mother Clare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare is a mystic; ordained priest; Master Teacher of Christian mysticism; and co-director of a mystical Christian Order, a school with 15 Centers of Light in cities across the country.
