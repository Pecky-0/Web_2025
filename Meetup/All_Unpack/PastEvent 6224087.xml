Gone are the days of living on mountain-tops and deserted lands in order to reach spiritual attainment.  Now the time has come to be in community, relating and working on ourselves through the work of relationship.  God is inside each person and the goal is to know that God, love that God, and love through that God.  &lt;br /&gt;Come and awaken to the gift spiritual community can have in your life and how to find the right one for you.  You will be glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
