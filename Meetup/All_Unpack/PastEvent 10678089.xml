Palestinians continue to suffer the devastating consequences of U.S. support to the unending blockade of Gaza. It is in this context that the National Assembly to End the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars and Occupations will be held July 10–12 to initiate an education and mass action campaign. We invite antiwar activists to consider how we can build a united movement that supports the various campaigns and actions of our local organizations. Join us in a discussion of strategy for building the antiwar movement locally, regionally, and nationally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is welcome to come!&lt;br /&gt;6:30 PM - Pizza and Refreshments&lt;br /&gt;7:00 PM - Discussion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is sponsored by the National Assembly Organizing Committee of Boston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please visit: www.stopthewars.org or www.natassembly.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information please call: 617-230-9382&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Take the elevator to the fifth floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matthew Andrews</member_name><member_id>5009779</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246207254000</updated><rating><average>2.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Socialists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonsocialists</urlname><id>519668</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Socialist Party USA -- Boston Branch</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245296616000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Building an opposition to the US wars in the era of the Obama administration</name><id>10678089</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245796200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonsocialists/events/10678089/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/4/5/global_8110933.jpeg</photo_url></item>
