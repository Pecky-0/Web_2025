Exit the Rotary heading towards the T station and get in one of the two left lanes. Take a left at the first light so the T is now on your right. You will go straight through 2 sets of lights. After you round the bend after the 2nd set of ligths the entrance to the parking lot will be on your right across from a condo complex. (If you go over the RR tracks you have gone too far.) Pull in, take a left and head towards the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet outside the Front Door.
