As a 16-year-old, John finished sixth in the third season of American Idol and is now completing his final year at Berklee before resuming his recording career!  Catch him while you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big band plays from 8:30 to 11:00pm, with a half-hour intermission during which time a jazz quartet will perform.  Also, there will be a beginner swing dance lesson at 7:30pm.  The lesson is a great opportunity for meetup members to meet each other (or at least the meetup members of the opposite sex) because the &amp;quot;followers&amp;quot; rotate through the &amp;quot;leaders&amp;quot; continuously.  Meetup members get a special hand stamp at the door so you can identify each other during the lesson.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Frank will be on stage conducting the band. Elizabeth will be teaching the swing lesson and be available for assistance during the band's first set.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elizabeth Miller</member_name><member_id>4485105</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224892355000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Swing Dancers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>swingdancing-110</urlname><id>549506</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston-Area Swing/Blues Dance Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1221968657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>American Idol Swing Dance in Concord, Mass.</name><id>8799983</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223163000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/swingdancing-110/events/8799983/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/2/global_5581826.jpeg</photo_url></item>
