I want to welcome any new members.... I know our group has not been to active lately... due to bad weather, and bad timing.... I want to let all of you know that you can plan play dates with each other, when we don't have a meet up... &lt;br /&gt;         We will have our Halloween party at my house this year.. I hope we get a good turn out.   &lt;br /&gt;I have picked Oct. 1st on Sat... hoping for no rain.. Rain date will be Sunday.  Be sure to check site to make sure the weather is not keeping us from having a good party...  Please bring your cameras to get some funny pictures...  &lt;br /&gt;          If you wish to bring a desert dish or healthy snack to share, that would be great.   Please call 641-3628 for any questions.  &lt;br /&gt; Pug hugs Patty&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please come in either the side gate or front door.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>patty</member_name><member_id>57327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257183398000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254745085000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Patty  </name><id>11550492</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1257010200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/11550492/</event_url></item>
