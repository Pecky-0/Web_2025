Here is a description of the event from Herb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Learn everything there is to learn about 6s, strengths, defenses, growth and development, relationship dynamics, subtypes of 6. Perfect for 6s, anyone in relationship to a 6, and anyone who wants to learn more about 6s.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested minimum cost of attending the workshop is $15.00. A sliding scale of any amount is allowed if the cost would otherwise prevent you from coming. The traditional cost of this workshop has been $40.00 so if you can afford more than $15.00, it helps the presenter and those who pay less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refreshments will be served. We are also welcomed to bring and share our own food as long as there is not any meat in it. Herb always has great snacks. Great food, company and an interesting topic - an awesome way to spend a Friday night!  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Herb Pearce</member_name><member_id>9052522</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295080226000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Intriguing-Lives</urlname><id>979502</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Intriguing Lives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292984536000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Special Workshop about  the Enneagram Type 6 (The Security Seeker) </name><id>15795336</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295051400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Intriguing-Lives/events/15795336/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/8/global_7203288.jpeg</photo_url></item>
