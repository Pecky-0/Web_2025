In the center of Poquonock at the traffic light, turn left onto River Street. Follow River Street for approximately .3 mile. Turn right into Strawberry Hills Park. During periods of low water, this area can be &amp;quot;scratchy.&amp;quot; Better launching times may be around 12:00 p.m. when water is typically released from the reservoir. NOTE: If you wish to run the rapids: In Poquonock, turn right onto Niles Road and continue to Welch Park. At the back of this town park there is a difficult carry to access the river and no formal boat launch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INTERMITTENT ACCESS POINTS&lt;br /&gt;Access Point 31, Pleasant Street Park, Windsor, CT This asphalt launch ramp is behind Bart?s on Rt. 159, located one mile north from jct. Rt. 75/305/159 in the center of Windsor.
