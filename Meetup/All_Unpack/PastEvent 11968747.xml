All children must be accompanied by an adult. My Daughter snow shoed and cross country skied this at the age of six and loved it. Parents can be the judge of what they think their child can handle.   &lt;br /&gt;Part of this trail will follow the Souhegan river which will lead us to Wild Cat Falls which everyone will want to take a moment to admire.We will then continue following the trail through wooded areas that will loop us back to where we started. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be dressed for winter conditions. &lt;br /&gt;Miles: 2 &lt;br /&gt;Time: Based on child's ability &lt;br /&gt;Place: Currier road Merrimack NH &lt;br /&gt;Follow Currier Road till the road starts to bend left.
