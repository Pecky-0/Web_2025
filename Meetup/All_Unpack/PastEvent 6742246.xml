Anything?  This Saturday I am planning an easy walk at Horse Hill Nature Preserve.  Horse Hill is the new nature preserve in Merrimack, NH on Amherst Road. If you go and someone asks you next week, you can say &amp;quot;I walked Horse Hill&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Horse Hill Nature Preserve:&lt;br /&gt;The approximately 563 acres of the Horse Hill Nature Preserve consist of gently rolling to fairly steep terrain and two hills of approximately 400' elevation.  The land was cleared for pasture in previous centuries, has been logged several times, and now consists primarily of a mixed hardwood forest with trees between 20 and 60 years of age.  The property includes a series of streams, ponds, swamps, and numerous wetlands totaling approximately 60 acres.  A power line easement traverses the property, creating a shrubland undergrowth area.  A small sandpit was created by previous owners, but sand has not been removed for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logging roads formed the basis of what is today a trail network used by hikers, bikers, hunters, snowmobilers, horse back riders, etc.  This trail network does cover the majority of the property, however, leaving large areas without defined access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The varied terrain, habitat, and large areas of undisturbed open space have encouraged a wide variety of wildlife to thrive on the property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the map, the main loop is approximately 4.2 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hhnp.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.hhnp.org/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195500981000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195079109000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy Walk: Horse Hill Nature Preserve</name><id>6742246</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195327800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/6742246/</event_url></item>
