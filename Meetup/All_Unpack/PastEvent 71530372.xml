&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

On July 4th, you're invited to come out to the annual anti-imperialist picnic/BBQ. There will be drinks, food and games by the beautiful Charles River. Feel free to bring a dish or beverage to share. The location will be the same as last year: right next to the the Charles River Canoe and Kayak. Here is a map and directions (look for the red and &lt;br /&gt;

black flags!): &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

11am til the fireworks start. &lt;br /&gt;

3:30pm pick-up football game &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

For many years Boston radicals have come out to the banks of the Charles on this day to band together to denounce the spectacle of July 4th. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

On the 4th of July, people forget about the brutal wars the USA is waging and has waged around the world. They are lulled into a nationalistic, delusional view that this country is better than all the rest; more free than the rest; the model the rest of the world should follow. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Don't sit back and take part in their spectacle. Come together to build a stronger community to fight against oppression and imperialism! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Fuck July 4th! Power to the people! &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

A special thanks goes out to the IWW local for donating money to help this event happen. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

In struggle, &lt;br /&gt;
