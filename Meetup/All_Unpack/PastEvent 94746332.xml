&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;This amazing, riveting, not-to-be missed documentary was filmed in 24 hours at Highland Hospital in Oakland, CA, where uninsured patients needing medical attention come to the ER of the nearly overwhelmed hospital and wait to be seen: 241 patients in 24 hours. Dramatic, funny and infuriating, the film shows, with unusually candid access, the inner workings of an ER close to the breaking point. We see not only the doctors and nurses, but also the feisty head receptionist (a real gem) in charge of keeping order in the waiting room, and back office staff trying to schedule the overloaded examination rooms and beds—and of course the wide variety of patients and their families—scared, angry, philosophical, caring, dignified. This spotlight on what's wrong with the American health care system is sure to provoke debate, yet its portrait of the dedicated efforts of the extraordinary caregivers trying to treat their patients humanely and competently under the most difficult of circumstances is also profoundly inspiring. Winner of both the Audience and Jury Prizes for Best Documentary at the San Francisco International Film Festival. Directed by Peter Nicks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;I will arrive at the theater at 6:15 p.m. and wait at the foot of the stairs in the theater lobby. &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for me carrying a red backpack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I already have my ticket and it can’t hurt to buy your ticket online or arrive early to buy it. &lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The movie starts at 6:45 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;At about 6:30, I will move into the theater auditorium so we can get seats (and I can’t miss the previews!). You can find me in the theater auditorium if you are late.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;After the movie, I will wait at the foot of the stairs in the theater lobby to gather everyone. &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for the red backpack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;If&amp;lt;&amp;lt; we decide to go out after the movie, be prepared to add 25% to the cost of your order for both the tax and the tip.&lt;/span&gt; Restaurants in the area add the gratuity to the check automatically. Bring &lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;CASH&lt;/span&gt; to make division of the check easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
