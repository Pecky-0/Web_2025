A man named Seth awakens to find himself chained to a table, looking up at a razor-edged pendulum on the ceiling. A videotaped message from Billy reveals that Seth had been sentenced to life in prison for murder, but was released on a technicality after five years. The pendulum descends toward him as it begins to swing; after 30 seconds it will be close enough to touch his skin, and after 60 seconds it will cut him in half. Seth is told that in order to save himself, he must "destroy the things that have killed â€” your hands" by inserting them into two presses and pushing the starter buttons inside. He does so, the presses crushing his hands, but the pendulum continues its descent. The clip ends at the 50-second mark when the title card comes up; Seth's fate is left unrevealed
