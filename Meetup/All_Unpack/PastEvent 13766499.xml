One of Roger Corman’s most notorious productions, this instant cult classic takes America’s obsession with violence to an outrageous extreme&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... I wonder how many points I would get if I ran over that bicyclist over there trying to cut me off? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Price&lt;/u&gt;: I believe each movie admission is $12.00 for each film, if I am not mistaken. It's pricey, but it still will be good to see both of them in 35 mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. Maher will be in The Garage on 36 JFK Street &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-garage-cambridge" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.yelp.com/b...&lt;/a&gt; starting at 5:45 pm in the lower level food court. There is a Subway that serves sandwiches, and a Taqueria nearby. Feel free to drop in! We can start walking over at 6:30 pm to the Harvard Film archive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J. is 5 foot 7, with short brown hair, blue eyes, a &amp;quot;Hello My Name is T.J.&amp;quot; nametag, and a red MEETUP sign attached to his black messenger bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is only an hour-and-a-half long. Let's grab beer or a late dinner after to discuss the movie somewhere in Harvard Square. Heh! I always seem to end up at John Harvards Brew House. Anybody have any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About SF-1970&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2010aprjun/sf1970.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The 1970s witnessed a remarkable efflorescence of science fiction films, with filmmakers in the U.S. and abroad channeling the relentless darkness and misanthropy of the period’s cinema into dystopian, paranoid and offbeat fables of a bleak new world. After 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), science fiction cinema entered an extraordinarily creative and fertile period equally distinguished by such brooding masterpieces as Solaris, Andrei Tarkovsky’s answer to Kubrick, and Nicholas Roeg’s haunting elegy for a dying race The Man Who Fell to Earth, as by the outrageous and imaginative satire of Death Race 2000 and Dark Star. Predicting a future ruled by reality television programs, genetic engineering, environmental plagues and insouciant robots, talented auteurs such as Robert Altman, David Cronenberg and Jim McBride brought a new sophistication and dark verve to one of the most popular postwar film genres&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Harvard Film Archive:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/general_info.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Harvard Film Archive offers a public cinematheque program, presenting films Friday through Monday nights year round. All screenings are held in the Archive's 200-seat theater located in the historic Carpenter Center for the Arts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The HFA frequently invites filmmakers to discuss their work and engage with the vibrant community of students, professors, artists and cinephiles who regularly attend Archive screenings. Recent visitors include the French director Agnès Varda (Les plages d'Agnès), American screenwriter and director Paul Schrader (Blue Collar), Catalan director Albert Serra (Birdsong), American independent filmmakers So Yong Kim (Treeless Mountain) and Lance Hammer (Ballast), Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel (The Headless Woman), Irish director John Boorman (The General), and Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong (Secret Sunshine), [...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The HFA's collection of 35 and 16mm material for almost 14,000 titles, as well as its many posters and documents, are accessible to faculty and students at Harvard, as well as to outside researchers, through our academic research services. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Established with the assistance of the Luce Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1979, the Harvard Film Archive has grown into an incomparably rich resource for scholars and filmmakers. A division of Harvard University's Fine Arts Library, the HFA is an affiliate of the International Federation of Film Archives&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/general_info.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://hcl.harvard.ed...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Harvard Film Archive is located in the lower level of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at 24 Quincy Street, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We are east of the Harvard Square Red Line T Stop, in between the Harvard Faculty Club and the Fogg Art Museum, one block north of Massachusetts Avenue between Broadway and Harvard Streets in the Harvard University campus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;u&gt;Parking&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Although parking in Cambridge is difficult (most of the surrounding streets have restricted parking for Cambridge residents only), metered parking on Broadway and Harvard Streets, as well as the rest of Harvard Square, is free after 8pm. Film-goers are encouraged to use public transportation, particularly the MBTA Red Line&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>T.J.
