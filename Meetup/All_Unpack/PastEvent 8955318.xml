We have planned a second Meetup for this month, to ensure that we will all have another chance to take advantage of the October loveliness, and to get some exercise and breathe fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOCATION: This Meetup will take place at West Rock, which is a Connecticut State Park located in New Haven and Hamden.  There are various entrances to the park, but we will be parking at Lake Wintergreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN:  West Rock offers various levels of hiking, as it is a very large park.  For this Meetup, we'd like to try a modest loop, beginning at Lake Wintergreen.  We will choose a route that is manageable for the average hiker.  No climbing will be required, but the hike may involve maneuvering over some rocky sections of trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE AND WHEN: Meet at the Lake Wintergreen entrance between 7:45 and 8, and we'll try to get rolling onto the trail by 8:15. This particular hike shouldn't take more than 3 hours, including stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRING:  A bottle of WATER! (And a snack if you like.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR: Hiking or other sturdy shoes with treads.  &lt;b&gt;LAYERS&lt;/b&gt; (something warm enough, over something cool enough, to be comfortable in the outdoors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST:  We ask for a donation of one dollar, towards the monthly fee that is charged by the Meetup Website.  Please bring any contributions with you on the day of the hike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?A=2716&amp;amp;Q=325276" target="_blank"&gt;Park website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Wintergreen+Ave+%26+Main+St,+CT+06514&amp;amp;sll=41.313428,-72.916724&amp;amp;sspn=0.007962,0.019312&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.35998,-72.962222&amp;amp;spn=0.007956,0.019312&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;g=Wintergreen+Ave+%26+Main+St,+CT+06514&amp;amp;iwloc=addr&amp;amp;iwstate1=saveplace" target="_blank"&gt;Google Map - Approximate Location of Park Entrance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:  The directions on the website seem vague.
