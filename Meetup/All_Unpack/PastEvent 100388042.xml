&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the likely high demand for this highly praised film I thought I'd add another meetup besides John's.&lt;/span&gt; The time is estimate; when the Kendall finalizes the exact time I'll update. And as always for the Kendall, advanced ticket purchase is advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Provocative writer/director Michael Haneke&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Caché, The Piano Teacher)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who previously won the Palme d'Or for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;The White Ribbon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, won the prestigious Cannes award again for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amour&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;("Love"). Treating his characters with unusual warmth and sympathy, his new drama shows old age and death with unflinching honesty, but nevertheless lives up to its title. This is a touching portrait of a longtime married couple, whose bond of love remains strong facing any hardship. It stars two of France's best-loved actors, both in their eighties: Jean-Louis Trintignant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;(A Man and a Woman, Z, The Conformist)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;and Emmanuelle Riva&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hiroshima Mon Amour)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;; both are superb. Georges and Anne are retired music teachers, living in a spacious apartment in Paris, venturing out occasionally to attend a concert by one of their former students. When Anne has an attack, Georges devotes himself to her care. Heartbreaking, uncommonly tender and haunting. With Isabelle Huppert. Nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress (Riva). In French. (Fully subtitled)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
