Go to dinner and a movie, or just dinner or just the movie!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meetup event is for those that don't celebrate Christmas, or find themselves with that evening free and would like to get out of the house for a few hours. Join us for dinner at the Royal Buffet in Manchester, and then if you'd like we can check out a movie afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buffet has everything to offer, from American, Italian, Chinese, steak, seafood, barbecue, seafood, and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.restaurantway.com/?restaurant=2745&amp;amp;view=restaurant" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.restaurantway.com/?restaurant=2745&amp;amp;view=restaurant" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.restaurant...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we'll be going to Sherlock Holmes which is opening that day.  The movie time is 7:40 so please be there no later than 7:25.  The movie theater is Showcase Buckland Hills.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you don't have to attend both events: join us just for dinner, or just for the movie. Just let me know which event you're going to attend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet by the front door - Lynne looks like her picture and she'll place a "Meetup" Sign on the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>3461529</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261955146000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>hartfordmovies</urlname><id>712992</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Area Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261072779000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a Movie:  Christmas Day</name><id>12104205</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261782000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/hartfordmovies/events/12104205/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/b/8/global_5165560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
