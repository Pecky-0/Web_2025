It's that time for all beginners to come and enjoy some completely beginner-level ASL! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you in ASL 1 or 2? Would you like to practice ASL with other beginners? Then come join us for ASL practice, plus Boston's best beer selection (112 beers on tap) at the Sunset Grille &amp;amp; Tap, 130 Brighton Ave. Take the Green Line to Harvard Ave, walk a block down Harvard Ave toward Brighton Ave, turn right, and you're there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bar/restaurant is right down the street from DEAF Inc., where many of us in the Boston ASL Meetup take (or have taken) ASL classes. We highly recommend DEAF Inc. for anyone learning ASL who wants to have experienced Deaf instructors leading their classes. Classes are held in the evening to accommodate work/school schedules, 6-8PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would love to meet you beginners! So come on out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Erika Wentworth</member_name><member_id>487803</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286286209000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>ASL Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonasl</urlname><id>1298565</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston ASL</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285934377000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beginner's Level Meetup at Sunset Grille &amp; Tap</name><id>14961802</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286238600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonasl/events/14961802/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/1/global_16399809.jpeg</photo_url></item>
