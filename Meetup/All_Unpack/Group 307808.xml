&lt;p&gt;We view the selected film and then go to a nearby restaurant to discuss. Sharing  thoughts and ideas from the multiple perspectives gathered, we learn from each other and also have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the group is to create a community for people who are interested in film and with that in mind, please RSVP with consideration for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is our custom, we meet near the front row at the movie's conclusion.  The organizer will hold a Meet-Up sign to make it easier to find us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to see interesting and challenging films that always lead to discussions which add a depth of understanding that makes each experience memorable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.58</rating><join_mode>approval</join_mode><created>1155954187000</created><lat>42.3600006104</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>542</id><urlkey>arthouse</urlkey><name>Arthouse</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>914</id><urlkey>indiefilm</urlkey><name>Indie Film</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>1201</id><urlkey>movies</urlkey><name>Movie Fans</name></topics_item></topics><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name><id>307808</id><members>313</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>2321575</member_id><name>John</name></organizer><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/7/0/e/600_22522286.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/7/0/e/highres_22522286.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>22522286</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/7/0/e/thumb_22522286.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><city>Boston</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/</link><lon>-71.0699996948</lon></item>
