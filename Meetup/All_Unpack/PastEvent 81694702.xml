Henry will give an informal presentation open for discussion with participants. This meeting is intended especially for those without a scientific background. Henry will introduce the greenhouse effect and discuss whether recent warming is man-made. In addition to talking about the causes of global warming, Henry will cover economic consequences of rapid warming. The meeting will include questions and answers and a group discussion. Henry believes it is important to act to overcome the bitter political stalemate that immobilizes the federal government on this and related issues. Henry is a seasoned scientist with many years in research and development, both in the biotechnology industry, and earlier, as a medical school faculty member. Most recently, until he retired in 2010, he was a patent agent focusing on biotechnology. Since 2010, Henry has become active in global warming and related environmental issues, including publishing his Global Warming Blog at &lt;a href="http://warmgloblog.blogspot.com/" class="linkified"&gt;http://warmgloblog.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt; . Henry has an A.B. in chemistry from Princeton, and he earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start with coffee and snacks from 4PM until 4:30PM, which will be followed by Henryâ€™s presentation and a group discussion. You are encouraged to bring a snack to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sholem</member_name><member_id>445389</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348962970000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347278926000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Global Warming: The Facts And The Issues--A Discussion With Henry Auer</name><id>81694702</id><duration>9000000</duration><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348948800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/81694702/</event_url></item>
