I was at the theater ,when I saw the trailer for this event and was intrigued.   I am a mega monster movie fan!  Monsters movie is part of The Best of 2010 Repertory Series being put on by the Brattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you not familiar with it, the Brattle is a wonderful old theater that puts old and little know movies on the big screen.  Pop corn with real butter, some baked goods and they serve beer and wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be in front of the Brattle near the box office at 7:15, the showtime is 8.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &lt;b&gt;strongly&lt;/b&gt; recommend buying tickets in advance.   Being in Harvard Square it is very popular with students and you don't want to get there and be disappointed.  The link to buy tickets is at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vendini.com/ticket-software.html?t=tix&amp;amp;e=d7b998b0559f541d708b9fe98e00358f" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.vendini.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie Details:&lt;br /&gt;(2010) dir Gareth Edwards w/Scoot McNairy, Whitney Able [94 min]&lt;br /&gt;This no-budget sci-fi feature marks a terrific directorial debut from Gareth Edwards. Shot on location in Central America with a barebones crew and spectacular – if sparingly used – creature effects, MONSTERS tells the story of a pair of unwilling companions who must make their way across a quarantined section of Mexico infested with dangerous alien lifeforms. A taut road movie infused with the impending threat of giant disgruntled monsters and two engaging lead performances, MONSTERS is a great little film from an up-and-coming filmmaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see the trailer:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://brattlefilm.org/2011/02/02/monsters/" target="_blank"&gt;http://brattlefilm.or...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a meetup pin and carrying a meetup sign at 7:15.
