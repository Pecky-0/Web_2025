<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>At one of the recent meet ups we talked about doing more events involving activities.  So, Robin has volunteered to lead this hike at Oak Hill – even if there is snow on the ground by then.    Of course, food is also involved if anyone would like to go for lunch at The Wholesome Café after the hike.  &lt;br /&gt;Oak Hill is near the junctions of Rt. 2 and 495.  Unfortunately at times the sound of traffic can be heard while on the trails, but this wooded area is amazing with the tophet chasm and summit rock features.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Rt. 2 to Taylor St north, or Rt 495 to Rt 2 to Taylor St North.  Then about 1 mile to 4 way intersection which is Littleton depot is on the right.&lt;br /&gt;At this 4 way intersection take a left on Sanderson Rd. for 1000' then right on Oak Hill for 1000', dirt parking lot on right, sign for Oak hill/Tophet chasm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can also take 2a/110 from Littleton or 495N to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or Liberty Square Rd off Rt. 111 out of West Acton, which becomes Taylor St. and goes over Rt. 495 then Rt. 2 to the 4 way Littleton intersection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://littletonconservationtrust.org/guide/oak-hill/oak-hill.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://littletonconse...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://wholesomecafe.net/" target="_blank"&gt;http://wholesomecafe....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please call my cell #508-361-7978 for help directions or other issues.
