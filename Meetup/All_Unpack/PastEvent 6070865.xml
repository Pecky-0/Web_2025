Since there is no such group in the Boston area, I figure I would create one to see if there is any interest.  No volleyball equipments as yet but we can work it out if there is enough members.  30 days before my card gets charge so join before I cancel:-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Huy</member_name><member_id>4635993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541825000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Volleyball players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>volleyball-122</urlname><id>585043</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Volleyball Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185306680000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston 2s Beach/Grass Volleyball Meetup</name><id>6070865</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185634800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/volleyball-122/events/6070865/</event_url></item>
