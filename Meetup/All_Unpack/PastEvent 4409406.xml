One of our members has kindly tracked down a new site for us for April, so we will be meeting at the Starbucks at Newton Centre on Union Street.  Geoff says the place &amp;quot;is huge, is very near a large municipal parking lot, and is right on the D Green Line (and by 'on,' I mean 'you can feel the trains go by.') Note that there are two Starbucks within about a quarter mile of each other in Newton Cent. This is the one on Union Street, immediately adjacent to the T stop, not the one on Centre Street, which is pretty tiny.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google Maps link: &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/m" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt; aps?q=70%20union%20street%2C%20newton%2C %20ma .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And note that April's meeting will be on Saturday, not Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1110751365000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Science Fiction Writers April Meetup</name><id>4409406</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1113076800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/4409406/</event_url></item>
