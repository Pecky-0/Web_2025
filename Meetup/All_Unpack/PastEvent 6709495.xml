Ya, you read that correctly, just a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to take a Greyhound bus from South Station, crazy early in the morning, at 7am, to NYC and when I get there, just walk around, maybe in Central Park, probably Rockefeller Center, Times Square, maybe do some shopping, have lunch, then come back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear comfortable shoes, and dress in layers to walk around outside, and to go in and out of stores, if that's what we decide to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone interested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I've been asked if this is a kid-friendly event.  It's going to be a very, very long day.  We're leaving around 7am and possibly won't return till midnight.  So, I guess it depends on the age of the kid and if everyone in the group agrees to have kids join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE # 2:  I bought my bus ticket online.  I'm leaving at 7am on the Schedule # bus 1815 from Boston and returning at 7pm on the schedule # bus 1864.  The coupon code is NYBOSR to get the discount.  I paid $31.50 total, which includes the credit service charge.

My cell phone # is 617-999-9094.  You'll need to call me that morning to find me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196779915000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194625290000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Road Trip - Boston to NYC</name><id>6709495</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196510400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6709495/</event_url></item>
