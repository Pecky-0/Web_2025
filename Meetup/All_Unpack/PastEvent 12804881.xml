<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>DoReMi is in Allston.  It has karaoke rooms just like the ones you would find in Asia.  We went there for my birthday and had lots of fun programming songs into the machine and taking turns singing.  The rooms are nice with comfortable seating and a table in the middle.  There are two microphones, but I think we can request more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The establishment does not allow alcohol, but you can bring whatever food or drink from outside or have something delivered.  I am thinking that we can all bring something we like to eat and share. When you RSVP, please let us know what you will be bringing.  There is nothing to heat the food up, so Jay and I kept everything in a &amp;quot;cooler&amp;quot; to keep the heat in last time we went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to karaoke but don't really want to do it in front of a bunch of strangers at a bar, this meetup is for you.  :0)  Here is the website:  &lt;a href="http://doremikaraoke.net" target="_blank"&gt;http://doremikaraoke....&lt;/a&gt;.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tammy </member_name><member_id>7303013</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269819296000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267927188000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Karaoke at DoReMi</name><id>12804881</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269646200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/12804881/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
