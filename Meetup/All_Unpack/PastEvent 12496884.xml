Now's your chance...while it's still cold outside, let's head inside to try some rocking climbing at the&lt;a href="http://rhodeislandrockgym.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Rhode Island Rock Gym&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I've never tried it but it looks like fun...I mean, how can you possibly keep a straight face while your climbing up an indoor wall with plastic blocks for foot/hand-holds and swinging on a rope?!?! Depending on the number of RSVPs we receive, I'll try to get the place to set up a group rate, however, at this point it looks as though you should be prepared to spend $20-30 &lt;a href="http://rhodeislandrockgym.com/content/rirg_rsc_pricing_3_09.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;depending on which package you chose &lt;/a&gt;(with or without lesson, etc.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming everyone is able to keep down their breakfast/lunch after some time on the ropes, maybe we'll find a spot for a quick bite/drinks afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://rhodeislandrockgym.com/pop_directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;DIRECTIONS HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bethany</member_name><member_id>10111481</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267067389000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265131367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rock Grinding - Indoor Rock Climbing!</name><id>12496884</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266688800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/12496884/</event_url></item>
