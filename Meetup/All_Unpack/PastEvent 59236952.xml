So don't delay in getting&amp;nbsp;out for some activity.&amp;nbsp;If you are looking for spring time fun with your pooch we have a great group for you. Best Friends is hosting a FREE meet-up group for friendly dogs. All breeds welcome so long as your dog likes to play with other dogs in a social environment. We have an indoor and outdoor playroom made specially for dog playdates. We provide water, toys, and clean up....as well as refreshments for both dogs and humans too! So come join us for a doggie play date on Saturday afternoon, we'd love to meet your pet. Please be sure your dog is current on Rabies, Distemper, and Bordetella vaccines because they will be around other dogs off leash. Please don't hesitate to call us with any questions you might have: 860-721-8080. &lt;span style="color : #800080"&gt;Happy Spring!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Pet Care</member_name><member_id>3611375</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335637609000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>All Breed Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DogLovers</urlname><id>448060</id><group_lat>41.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>The Rocky Hill "All Breed" Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333558567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring Fling Fun!</name><id>59236952</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335632400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DogLovers/events/59236952/</event_url></item>
