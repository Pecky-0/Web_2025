Just this little hole in the wall place, not fancy, but we have great karaoke on Friday nights at 9pm. If you like to sing this is the spot short rotation, but plenty of people enjoying the karaoke, so a great audience, and lots of singing for you, what could be better. Stop on in DJ Dave or DJ Jodi host each week, great song selection and professional equipment. Stop on in, we would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344112806000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343831367000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Karaoke in Everett @ Josie's Place</name><id>75838062</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344042000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/75838062/</event_url></item>
