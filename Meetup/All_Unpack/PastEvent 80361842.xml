&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 2:00 pm in the lot at the end of Coliseum Ave, which is off of Rte 130 in Nashua. &lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; RAIN CANCELS THIS EVENT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/4/4/event_11468004.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;A lot of us have the day off So, I think it would be fun to go hiking on the trails at Mine Falls Park in Nashua. Please know that our intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way. This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout. I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two or three hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail. This park is just full of beautiful views, so come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIRECTIONS: Take exit 6 from Route 3 (Route 130) and go west towards Brookline, take the second entrance to the shopping center area (Colliseum Ave), go all the way to the end of the road for the parking lot. Look for the meetup sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the event, if anyone cares too. We can go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a drink or some food, at Shortie's, a nearby restaurant at 2pm.. This event is at no cost. We hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress for the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
