The full grounds include 480 acres with the ruins of a 19th century estate and gardens, rolling hills, enormous trees, and in-season, the state’s largest mountain laurel display.   The scenery moves swiftly from riverside views, to deep pine woods, to open meadows – with lots of hidden spots once reserved for the rich and famous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be surprised by the extent and crumbling beauty of the land and surviving outbuildings. There are extraordinary trails, but no posted explanation whatsoever about the family that once owned this rambling acreage.  The Harvard Alumni page is the source for the information that follows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History of Maudslay&lt;br /&gt;The Harvard Alumni page is the source for the information that follows.  It seems that the former Fredrick Moseley Estate was originally called &amp;quot;Maudesleigh&amp;quot; and was built atop an early 19th century farm. There were up to 40 staff and 30 structures including separate houses for the head gardener, coachman and estate forester. Most of the newer buildings were built from 1895 to 1910.  The 72-room mansion was demolished in 1955. Landscape archtect Martha Brookes Hutcheson was among the first three women members of American Society of Landscape Architects. There were extensive gardens, extensive stone walls, many cold frames and greenhouses, a large bunker, an animal cemetery and an enormous rhododendron collection that blooms annually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the above information is borrowed, for the most part, word for word, from the following website, should you like to read more:  &lt;a href="http://www.seacoastnh.com/Travel/Scenic_Walks/Maudslay_State_Park/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.seacoastnh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Walk&lt;br /&gt;We will start the hike at 9:10.
