It's the &amp;quot;Rubber Match&amp;quot; as the Pats take on their arch-nemesis the Jets for the third time this year, once more in chilly Foxboro.  We, however, will be watching from the warmth of Talk of the Town.  We'll have our own table, so there will be space to watch the game instead of fighting for space in better-known establishment (Game time is 4:30).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overlooking Eagle Square, the Talk of the Town is a neighborhood bar with a bit of character. It's located at the far end of Atwells Avenue, just across the Route 6/10 overpass bridge from Federal Hill. Street parking on the bridge is legal and usually a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put on your face paint and your jersey, grab your friends and join us for this sure-to-be-thrilling game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher</member_name><member_id>10240270</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295290108000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295133655000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Patriots vs. Jets @ Talk of the Town</name><id>16061934</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295211600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/16061934/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/3/global_20804819.jpeg</photo_url></item>
