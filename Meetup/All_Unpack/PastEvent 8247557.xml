That Saturday night was the first house party for Ron and it was at Kevin's house.  We also had lots of other meetings at Kevin's house and Kevin hosted many people for Operation Live Free or Die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's now return the favor and help Kevin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin is running for the NH House as an Independent. In order to be on the ballot Kevin needs to gather 150 valid signatures.&lt;br /&gt;Please come help gather those signatures.&lt;br /&gt;The more people we have the faster this will go. We will probably go out in pairs.&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 9am at his house and go over the guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't make it until later please let us know and we will let you know we will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and spread the word.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dreepa</member_name><member_id>4145573</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216645417000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214853281000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kevin Roll signature campaign</name><id>8247557</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216472400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/8247557/</event_url></item>
