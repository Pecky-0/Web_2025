Those that couldn't get away for a mid-week trip wanted something planned for a weekend.  You asked for it and now you have it - a local whitewater rafting trip on the weekend.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience Class III and IV rafting excitement close to home on the Deerfield River’s most exciting section, the Monroe Bridge Dryway.  From Factory Rapid past Dunbar Brook, Dragon’s Tooth and Labyrinth, the rolling whitewater keeps you on your toes while the rugged northern Berkshires provide a backdrop of exceptional natural beauty. We will stop for a snack along the river and then after the trip we will return to Zoar for a barbecue lunch and a slide show of the day’s adventures.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cost is $105.06 per person and they are holding 20 spaces for our group until August 24th.  So make sure you get a spot by making your reservation before then, otherwise you might get shut out of this great event.  When booking your trip be sure to indicate that you are with the Blair Group so that they will keep the group together.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoar Outdoor  &lt;br /&gt;(800) 532-7483  &lt;br /&gt;info@zoaroutdoor.com  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zoaroutdoor.com/drywayrafting.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.zoaroutdoo...&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 9:30 AM at the Zoar Outdoor located in Charlemont, MA.  This will allow us enough time to meet and get ready for the trip.  Charlemont is approximately 2 1/2 hours west of Boston.  To get there from Boston take Route 2 west.  Where Route 2 merges with Interstate 91 in Greenfield be sure to exit again onto Route 2 west (exit 26).  Zoar is about 17 miles west of this exit, located in a red colonial on the north side of the road.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip begins at 10:30 and usually takes about 4 hours on the river and about 6 hours overall, including registration, transportation to the river, a snack stop, a barbecue lunch served at the Zoar, and a slide show of the trip.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a list describing the minimum gear and equipment required to participate in this event.
