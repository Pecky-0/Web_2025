We love the original store in Marblehead and are thrilled that we can now get board games in downtown Salem.  The owner of the store has graciously offered us their meeting space for an after-hours evening Meetup event from 7-9 p.m.  This Meetup will be a great opportunity to not only play some games but check out the store's selection and take advantage of the discount they will be offering us that evening.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be some food and drink provided, but you are welcome to bring any favorites you might like.  Please bring any favorite board games you might have and prepare to have a good time.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284875529000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281643339000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup at Mud Puddle Toys</name><id>14404900</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284591600000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/14404900/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/1/global_11205793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
