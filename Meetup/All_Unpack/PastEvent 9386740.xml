In 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be voted into public office in America. His victory was not just a victory for gay rights; he forged coalitions across the political spectrum. From senior citizens to union workers, Harvey Milk changed the very nature of what it means to be a fighter for human rights and became, before his untimely death in 1978, a hero for all Americans. Sean Penn stars as Harvey Milk under the direction of Gus Van Sant in Milk, filmed on location in San Francisco from an original screenplay by Dustin Lance Black, and produced by Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Sean Penn, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Diego Luna, James Franco &lt;br /&gt;Director: Gus Van Sant &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...mostly more conventional than compelling. &amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Kenneth Turan&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...a powerful drama stirringly told.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;USA Today&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Claudia Puig&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...most notable for the surprising and entirely winning performance by Sean Penn in the leading role.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Variety&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Todd McCarthy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet in the lobby no later than 7:15.
