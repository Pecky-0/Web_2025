Portions are large, the help is friendly and prices are quite reasonable. It's been in the neighborhood for quite a while and has a very loyal following. We'll be having lunch at 1:00. Entrees, salads and panini are almost all in the $9.95-13.95 range.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To locate the restaurant, walk down the left side of Hanover Street if you're coming from the Greenway and take your 2nd left ontoÂ  Prince St. (at Caffe dello Sport &amp;amp; St. Leonard's Peace Garden.) If you get there between 12:00 and 1:00, join us for a glass of wine at the bar. Haymarket is the nearest T-stop and the Parcel 7 Garage (entrance on Sudbury St.) the best place to park. Please bring cash, as we won't be getting separate checks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
