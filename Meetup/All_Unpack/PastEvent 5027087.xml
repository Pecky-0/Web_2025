Great venue to meet new faces, lounge out, and dance.  Diverse crowd and international clientele.  Hope to see everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plan:  Meet at 9pm at the CharlesMark Hotel (655 Boylston Street, across from Boston Public Library, Copley T stop).  We will meet inside the hotel bar/lounge before heading over to Saint at around 10pm.  Please try to meet us at the hotel bar as Saint can get really crowded and finding people will be difficult inside.  Give me a call if you need help with directions or finding the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picture is on this site (6ft tall Asian guy shouldn't be too hard to find).  When you see the group, just introduce yourself and say you are a friend of Charlie.  If your picture is up on the site, do RVSP and I'll look for you as well. My phone is 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an upscale lounge, so please dress appropriately.  I expect there will be a cover charge (most likely $15.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
