Those of us who were lucky enough to go to Monica's luau know how much fun we can expect to have!  Sandy and Andy are organizers and are planning the menu, so please email Joanne to let her know what you can bring.  She can work with them.   Here's their write up:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/25/08: Bring a bathing suit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monica will setup a sprinkler and a water table for the kids to play with. I'll come up with some water related games as well. There is a field down the street if we decide that the kids need to expend some energy playing soccer or kickball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep your RSVP's updated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- &lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/20/08: I am starting a food list for the BBQ.
