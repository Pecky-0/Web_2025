Both newcomers and experts are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that we'll be having dinner at Union Street Restaurant (if you'd like), and that Meetup.com charges us a small fee for using their services, which will average out to about $4 per person per meeting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Adam Marx</member_name><member_id>2037274</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540601000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Transformational Individuals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nlp-100</urlname><id>300638</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston NLP and Hypnosis Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160093066000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Neuro Linguistic Programming October Meetup</name><id>5177998</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1161903600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nlp-100/events/5177998/</event_url></item>
