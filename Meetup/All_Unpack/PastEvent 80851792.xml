If you can drive, put so in your RSVP along with how many passengers you can take in your car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is on their own this time when it comes to purchasing their tickets. There are places you can get them ahead of time. Please post here in the comments where you buy your tickets if you do buy them ahead of time. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking the best place to park the cars and meet would be the North Haven Stop &amp;amp; Shop parking loy at 10:00AM ???&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>simone</member_name><member_id>7013797</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1348784767000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Party People</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Partyexpress</urlname><id>478650</id><group_lat>41.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8600006104</group_lon><name>PartyExpress !!
