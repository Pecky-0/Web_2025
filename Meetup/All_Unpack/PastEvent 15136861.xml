Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain is historic. The Forest Hills Educational Trust opened the Contemporary Sculpture Path in 2001, establishing one of Bostonâ€™s most ambitious collections of temporary and permanent public art. On Sunday October 24 they are having a &amp;quot;10th Anniversary Celebration of The Contemporary Sculpture Path.&amp;quot; There are events from 1:00-5:00, but this meet-up is specifically for the 3:00pm flute concert (Bach and Debussy) and the 3:30pm tour of the sculpture path with some of the participating artists. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; I'll be at the main front gate of the cemetery by 2:45. I'm tall, look like my photo, and will have a Meet-up sign of some kind.  A little before 3pm, we'll stroll to where the concert will be held. If you get there later, find the flute concert before it ends. Since this is a guided tour that starts at 3:30, &lt;i&gt;we won't wait for stragglers&lt;/i&gt;, so be there or be square! (After RSVPs close, I'll send out my cell phone # to those who RSVP 'yes' and 'maybe.')   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a page with details of the full afternoon events (scroll down for the Oct. 24 listing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foresthillstrust.org/calendar.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foresthillstrust.org/calendar.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.foresthill...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Forest Hills Cemetery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foresthillstrust.org/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foresthillstrust.org/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.foresthill...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested in getting a bite and/or drink afterwards to talk about art, spirituality, and Halloween (or whatever), there's a number of fine spots in Jamaica Plain.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Main front gate (see listing below for more info)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob</member_name><member_id>2963965</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288461191000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287333167000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Contemporary Scultpture Tour in a Cemetery</name><id>15136861</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287945900000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/15136861/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/5/global_18806117.jpeg</photo_url></item>
