<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>For June, we don't have a formal presentation, but someone suggested delving into the details of how Python software is packaged and distributed.  I can show how I've done things, but there's stuff I don't know, so it'll be a collaborative exploration entitled:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ** I'll Show You My Package If You'll Show Me Yours **&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;If you've been confused by setup.py, setuptools, distutils, easy_install, eggs, pip, pypi, and so on, come and see at least part of it de-mystified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you know what any of these things are, then come and help educate the rest of us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be at Betahouse in Central Square.  Remember, cheap plentiful parking is just around the corner on at the municipal Green St. garage.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ned Batchelder</member_name><member_id>1824278</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247702326000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244568411000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>June Cambridge Python meetup</name><id>10613171</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245279600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/10613171/</event_url></item>
