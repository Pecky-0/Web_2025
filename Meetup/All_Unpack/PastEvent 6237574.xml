This food drive will supply food to needy people throughout the state.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Voluntary charities also promote self-reliance, but government welfare programs foster dependency.&amp;quot; - Ron Paul 2003 (&lt;a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul80.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.lewrockwel...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This food drive will help Americans understand that opposition to government welfare programs doesn?t mean opposition to charity, since private charities are more efficient and responsive than government programs.  And they involve one-on-one caring, rather than forced participation through taxation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To participate, bring at least one bag of food items to the rally on the 29th in Manchester, NH.  For more details on the rally, see &lt;a href="http://www.ronpaul2008.com/events/manchester-nh-rally-canvassing" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ronpaul200...&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;Cash donations will also be accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food items urgently needed are:&lt;br /&gt;- Protein items such as canned tuna or chicken and canned stews and pasta &lt;br /&gt;- Peanut butter &lt;br /&gt;- 100% juice boxes (no glass please) &lt;br /&gt;- Canned fruits in light syrup, applesauce &lt;br /&gt;- Canned vegetables, tomatoes and tomato sauce &lt;br /&gt;- Soups &lt;br /&gt;- Healthy cereals &lt;br /&gt;- Pasta, rice &lt;br /&gt;- Dry beans &lt;br /&gt;- Financial Donations:  $1 = 4 meals! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be bashful, the truck can hold 20,000 lbs of food!
