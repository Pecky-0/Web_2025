<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Please come join me for a lovely intermediate hike in the Quabbin. This hike is approximately 7-8 miles of mostly easy terrain beginning at Quabbin Gate 29 which will lead us down a partially old tar and gravel road. We will detour to Rattlesnake Hill then do a loop from there on some very nice scenic dirt roads eventually leading to a trail taking us back to the same road for our return trip back to gate 29. I've been told this is what is known by avid hikers as a Lolly Pop Hike;-). Some areas are very scenic so a camera is recommended. The hiking trail into Rattlesnake Hill is fairly steep but not very long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Please be able to hike along at the 2- 2 1/2 MPH pace expected in this hike. We will take our time however on the ascend to Rattlesnake Hill. Also plan to take a 20 minute lunch break at about the halfway point. Sound good;-)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Dressing appropriately for weather conditions is equally important. Don't want to loose anyone to heat exhaustion. An adequate water supply(at least 16-32 ounces) is also a must to bring with you on the hike. I hope this doesn't offend anyone but posting this because people do come unprepared sometimes unfortunately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Please wear bug repellent at least on your shoes due to heavy tick season and just a reminder of the EEE Virus and to protect yourself as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Also please let me know of your treatment plan and location of said treatment. Thank you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are parking at Gate 29 on rt 202.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Hiking loop trails to other gates. Historical sites, birdwatching, and views of the Quabbin. No pets, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates 29 and 30 both end up on the same paved road, but Gate 30 also crosses the lovely, stone-arched Keystone Bridge, built by hand in 1866 to span the Middle Branch of the Swift River. From the bridge a fisherman’s trail leads east along the river to the Quabbin Reservoir. Along the approximately 2½-mile main trail are many cellar holes, echoes of the lost section of New Salem, and varied habitats—woodland, edge, and open field—leading to the shores of the Quabbin. One side trails allows a loop hike that exits at Gate 28, with the last leg along Rte. 122; another connects with Gate 27 near New Salem center; and a third makes a steep climb up Rattlesnake Hill to a magnificent view of the reservoir. Consult a map or guidebook for details. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Rte. 2, take Exit 16 and go south on Rte. 202. Turn left on Rte. 122; Gate 30 is a few hundred yards further on the right. (&lt;span style="color : #008000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate 29 is a short way further south on Rte. 202, on the left.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Elm Street is opposite the parking area off rt 202 and can also be used for overflow roadside parking.&lt;/p&gt;
