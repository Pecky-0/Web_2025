There are views from both summits. Unless the distance of the hike is an issue for you I would rate this as an easy hike. It is mostly a line hike in that we will come back on the same trail the same way. The distance between summits is 2.3 miles one way (4.6 miles round trip) If at North Pack Monadnock we chose to take in the additional views from the Cliff Trail it will add approximately an additional mile to the hike.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;As we are hiking along the ridge of a mountain the elevation gain/loss is a about 400 feet as we go downhill and uphill again in between the two summits. The heights of the two summits 2290 and 2278 feet.
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Unless the price has gone up addmission to Miller State Park is $4 per person.
