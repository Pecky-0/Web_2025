We'll be using this time to share insights and epiphanies, do a group meditation, listen to an inspiring talk by one of our favorite mindfulness teachers, and have a short discussion about that talk to wrap things up. We've found these meetups to be a spirited community gathering for people who are seeking to bring more awareness, intentionality, and general mindfulness into their lives. While we often listen to buddhist talks because they are the ground from which mindfulness grows, we don't limit ourselves to buddhist thought or any particular teachers. We hope you can join us as we seek to cultivate more wisdom and compassion into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
