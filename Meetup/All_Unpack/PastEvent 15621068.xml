Meet activists and other volunteers. The Sierra Club office is fully accessible, located near the MBTA's Downtown Crossing and State Street stations. Come anytime! Weather/Snow notice: if the MBTA is running, the Party will go on! RSVPs welcome at meetup.com. This is a free event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are also taking this as an opportunity to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Artic National Wildlife Refuge.  We'll have a 10 minute video on the natural beauty of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the native people who live there and the challenge it faces from the demand to open it up to oil drilling.    You can also do one final good dead for the environment by signing a postcard to president Obama asking him to protect it permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mary Ann!</member_name><member_id>618637</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292526927000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Environmental Activists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Sierra-Club</urlname><id>229402</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Sierra Club Environmental Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291308718000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Annual Holiday Party and Artic National Wildlife Reufge Meetup</name><id>15621068</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292446800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Sierra-Club/events/15621068/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/3/global_7614675.jpeg</photo_url></item>
