<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Chris ShiningBrook will be joining us for another past life regression session.  Did you know your children before this lifetime?  You may be surprised at the different roles you have had with the people who are now your family and friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for great food and conversation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, many come to the potlucks other than Meetup members, so do not look at the RSVP's to determine if it will be a well attended event!  We do hope you will come and join other like-minded folks!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan gale</member_name><member_id>572960</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541321000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Families of Intuitive People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester</urlname><id>83587</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8700027466</group_lon><name>Paths to Light</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177196622000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Worcester Indigo Children and Parents May Meetup</name><id>5694977</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179612000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Paths-to-Light-in-Worcester/events/5694977/</event_url></item>
