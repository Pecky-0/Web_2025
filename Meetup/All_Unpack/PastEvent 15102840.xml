THIS EVENT IS CANCELED.&lt;br /&gt;Please join me and friends at anytime for late afternoon of fun and easy exercise, or just come to watch. Wimp Volleyball is a noncompetitive game. Totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We will be following the rules. But, having fun and learning will be more important than winning. We work on trying to keeping the volley going, rather than trying to end the volley. We count the laughs, not the score. So, bring your friends and teens, an your drinks to keep cool and hydrated and insect repellent. &lt;br /&gt;Also we often go out afterwords ( 6 pm. ) for some food or drinks. So, plan to join us for that also. &lt;br /&gt;We will be asking for a $1.00 donation to help play for the equipment. But please remember, your attendance is more important than the your money. We would rather you play than pay. The money is only to help pay for and maintain the equipment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will also have another event going at the same time, Wimp Volleyball Chatting &amp;amp; Cheerleading. This event requires a lawn chair and the ability to chat.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287434584000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287016355000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wimp Volleyball</name><id>15102840</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287342000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/15102840/</event_url></item>
