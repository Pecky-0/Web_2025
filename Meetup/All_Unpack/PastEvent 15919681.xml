&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to try working a little larger than ATC size you might like to use bingo cards (these are 3.5 x 5.75 inches). I'll provide the cards and basic supplies you'll need to make a couple. I'll have some vintage images, tissue paper, ribbons, colored pencils, buttons, puzzle pieces, assorted game pieces, etc.  This is a good time to use any of your own images that are just too big for ATCs. And since the cards won't be traded and put in sleeves they can be 3-dimensional. You can use found objects, old jewelry, small dolls, etc.  Please bring your basic tools including scissors, xacto knife, glue stick, and any other items you tend to use.  In case of snow or ice we'll need to reschedule, but since the Super Bowl is the next day it'll have to wait a couple of weeks. Please keep your status up to date so no one has to miss out if you can't come. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pat</member_name><member_id>4858394</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297222912000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294182946000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SUNDAY the 6th  - Altered Bingo Cards Workshop</name><id>15919681</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297015200000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/15919681/</event_url></item>
