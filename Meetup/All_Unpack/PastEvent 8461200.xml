Well, now you can take that ability and put it to good use!  At this event, you can shout out every word of the movie, if you wish, and this behavior is not only acceptable, but encouraged!  They're also having games, prizes and props to get us even more involved with Buttercup, Westley, Inigo, Fezzik, Vizzini, Humperdinck and all our other favorite characters!  Check this link for more details:  &lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/node/1959" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolidge.o...&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love this movie, you can't miss this event.  It's a guaranteed great time!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can order your tickets online. I have no idea if this will sell out, but ordering early is always a good idea.  The movie starts at 7:00 PM.  I'll arrive at 6:30 or a bit earlier.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email me with any questions!  Hope to see you on Monday, Aug. 11!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nikki&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be waiting outside (weather permitting) in a purple shirt.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219186448000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217687736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Princess Bride "Quote Along"</name><id>8461200</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218493800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/8461200/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/f/global_4486527.jpeg</photo_url></item>
