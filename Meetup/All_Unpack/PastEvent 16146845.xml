I heard them at Symphony Hall many years ago and was blown away.  They give a top-notch performance and their music is incredible in its breadth and scope.  Not to be missed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For over 30 years, Sweet Honey In The Rock has moved audiences mightily, singing and signing their way across the epic landscape of African-American music and culture from the blues to gospel, reggae and hip hop. At every performance, Sweet Honey In The Rock delivers songs of hope, justice, love, and peace with a pure, smooth, fabulous sound as only these vocal masters can. Believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Trying to describe an evening spent with Sweet Honey In The Rock would be like trying to describe seeing Moses part the red Sea. Unless you were there, you can’t fully take it in.&amp;quot; —Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be an American Sign Language interpreter at this performance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy the &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; tickets and I plan to go in to the box office &lt;b&gt;in person&lt;/b&gt;, so we don't have to pay the ridiculous $5.00 per ticket fee!  If you would like to join me, please RSVP &lt;b&gt;NOW&lt;/b&gt;.  Cost will be $50 per person - this includes the Paypal charge and a tiny bit for my gas costs.  DO NOT pay anything now.  Once you have RSVPed, I will send you an email explaining how to pay me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official website (including music samples!) here: &lt;a href="http://www.sweethoney.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sweethoney...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm giving a week's lead time - I'll be going to the box office early next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll email a meeting place.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1307293791000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Culture Vultures</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>culturevulturesBoston</urlname><id>1165987</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Culture Vultures - Singles over 50</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295731820000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Sweet Honey in the Rock" at Symphony Hall</name><id>16146845</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304726400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/culturevulturesBoston/events/16146845/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/1/global_20964289.jpeg</photo_url></item>
