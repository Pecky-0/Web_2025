Let's start with this one.  I've seen it and there are definitely some memorable performances.  The movie starts at 7pm so please arrive by 6:45.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane (1962)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two aging film actresses live as virtual recluses in an old Hollywood mansion. Jane Hudson, a successful child star, cares for her crippled sister Blanche, who's career in later years eclipsed that of Jane. Now the two live together, their relationship affected by simmering subconscious thoughts of mutual envy, hate and revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring: Betty Davis and Joan Crawford&lt;br /&gt;Director: Robert Aldrich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume you can bring your own popcorn, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the rest of the lineup for the season.  Let me know if you'd like to see any of them posted.  I'm definitely going to post From Here to Eternity.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 3: Blue Hawaii, starring Elvis Presley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 10: Jaws, starring Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfuss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 17: Local Hero, starring Burt Lancaster and Peter Reigert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 24: From Here to Eternity, starring Montogmery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Debra Kerr, Burt Lancaster, Donna Reed and Ernest Borgnine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 31: Beach Blanket Bingo, starring Frankie and Annette&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I've never been here so I'm not sure where the movie is shown.
