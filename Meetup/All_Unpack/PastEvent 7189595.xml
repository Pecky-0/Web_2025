Last summer, after a few discussions with the CEO of Integral Institute, Robb Smith - Nicole and Robb shared a few thoughts on how to help Ken Wilber meet-up groups move more towards a vehicle for growth - one that takes the theory of Integral from the realm of ideas and into the world of form, action, practice and evolution.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all feel that we have an amazing opportunity to redefine this group and take it to the next level.  In many ways - we have the opportunity to pave the way for other groups all over the world.  To do this, it takes vision, organization, dedication, compensation, action/involvement and commitment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For our next meeting, John and Nicole of Samadhi, would like to facilitate a discussion about the vision, tone and direction of this group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic topic for discussion will be  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remaining a Discussion Group VS. Becoming a Practice Group and what each of those mean.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do hope to see as many members as possible for this meeting!  This is our Integral &amp;quot;We&amp;quot; space and we want to get as much input as possible.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole Trudel Churchill</member_name><member_id>3348175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204417520000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1201223104000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Ken Wilber Group February Meetup</name><id>7189595</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204244100000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/7189595/</event_url></item>
