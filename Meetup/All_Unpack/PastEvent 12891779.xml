The Historical Society began in 1937, committed to collecting and preserving the unique history of the Village of Essex. The Museum was established in 1976 as part of the town's observation of the American Revolutionary Bicentennial.  The Museum maintains one of the best maritime collections in the region. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located in the heart of Essex, Massachusetts, the Museum is adjacent to an acre of land set aside in 1668 “for a yard to build vessels and employing workmen for this end” and is integral to the town's historic character, scenic vista and central river basin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features include antique shipbuilding tools, photographs, documents, exhibits portraying the shipbuilding industry, and the schooner Evelina M. Goulart. The Lewis H. Story, flagship of the Museum, was built on the site in 1998 and is often seen at the Museum or at nautical events throughout New England. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tours include video presentations and hands-on activities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gift shop offers ship plans, maritime books, and other nautical memorabilia.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>74173</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269975912000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268759105000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Essex Shipbuilding Museum</name><id>12891779</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269802800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/12891779/</event_url></item>
