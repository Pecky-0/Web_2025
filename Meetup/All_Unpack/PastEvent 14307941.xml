Anyone who wants to join us there is welcome. A chance to meet some of your fellow NEHM members. With the 2 sites, we should have space for 4 tents, maybe more depending on size &amp;amp; creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This location is great for hikers and bikers with many trails and paths nearby.  I don't yet know where I'll be hiking on Sunday (or Saturday), I'll decide later. Julie has scheduled hikes for Mt Willard on Saturday and Arethusa Falls on Sunday, check the calendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online reservations for Sugarloaf II have to be made at least 7 days in advance and there are only a few reservable sites left. We are reserved for both Friday night and Saturday, though I've only put the event on the calendar for Saturday night.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>JCarter</member_name><member_id>11575712</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283210090000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280866646000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Camp and Hike White Mountains</name><id>14307941</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283022000000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14307941/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/c/0/global_16938448.jpeg</photo_url></item>
