&lt;p&gt;There are only two things more American than  baseball&amp;mdash;eating a slice of apple pie while wearing a set of George  Washington's dentures and taking a day off work to read Jamie Farr's  autobiography. Partake in a piece of Americana with today's Groupon: for  $23, you get one general-admission ticket to the Saturday, April 30 &lt;a href="http://gr.pn/hCMnDS"&gt;Pawtucket Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; game at historical &lt;a href="http://gr.pn/hrSAV1"&gt;McCoy Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, plus admittance to an all-you-can-eat &lt;a href="http://gr.pn/gqf7fR"&gt;pregame barbecue&lt;/a&gt;,  one soft drink during the game, and a souvenir baseball cap (a $46  value). The barbecue lasts from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., and the game begins at  6:05 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pawtucket Red Sox, the Boston Red Sox's Triple-A  affiliate, gives fans a glimpse of the players who are on the brink of  cracking the glass ceiling in order to ascend into the pros. On April  30, will them to victory with shouts of encouragement from any of the  blue &lt;a href="http://gr.pn/eyBFqQ"&gt;general-admission&lt;/a&gt; seats as the team takes on the &lt;a&gt;Toledo Mud Hens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the game, guests can pile up their plates with  an unlimited number of grilled picnic fare, including hamburgers,  cheeseburgers, hot dogs, and grilled chicken breasts, and creamy potato  salad. After two hours of munching, guests can either stay in the  barbecue area or hop inside the stadium. The ticket also grants you  field access to the postgame fireworks show, which, like finding  marshmallow peeps littered all over the ground, is the first sign of  spring. The barbecue goes on rain or shine, but if the baseball game is  canceled because of rain, tickets will be reissued for the Friday, May  13 game against the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will pass out my cell phone number that Friday before the game to anyone who RSVP's "Yes"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Patrick Foley</member_name><member_id>7811990</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304255452000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>At the time of this posting, Groupon is offering a General Admission ticket to the Pawtucket Red Sox game on Saturday, April 30, access to their pre-game BBQ for all-you-can-eat food, and a baseball hat - all for $23!</why><group><who>Natives</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>natives</urlname><id>1098392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Red Sox Natives</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1302008948000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pawtucket Red Sox Game and Pre-game BBQ</name><id>17189602</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1304193600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/natives/events/17189602/</event_url></item>
