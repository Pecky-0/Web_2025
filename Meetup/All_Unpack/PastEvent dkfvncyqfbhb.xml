<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I live in the Athol area and want to get out for more hikes, especially weekday afternoon hikes, when time permits me to do that. If anyone is interested in joining me, I would love some company. I was thinking we could take turns suggesting places to hike or maybe get a few going in different areas so it works for all. I don't mind traveling when time permits. If you RSVP for this hike, please talk to me (and the group) via the comment space about what is practical for you time wise, days available, some areas to hike, etc... We can use this posting as an open forum to find hiking friends with compatible schedules. Please use the comment section below to communicate with everyone. This posting can be used each time we hike and just simply updated for each hike. I'll suggest hikes and hiking times too but I am looking for your suggestions and trying to coordinate something practical for everyone, if that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Black Pick up truck</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331032565000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1329836228000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekday Afternoon Hikes/weekend hikes too(Monday Hikes)</name><id>dkfvncyqfbhb</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330963200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group/events/53177442/</event_url></item>
