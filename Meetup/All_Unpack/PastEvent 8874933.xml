<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Inspired by Tom's poll regarding the Kendall (please vote if you haven't already), I'm posting this to see how successful last-minute events are.  (I've had mixed results with this method in the past, but this film will be brand new. It's had mixed-to-good reviews -- at the very least it could lead to interesting conversation!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the film:&lt;br /&gt;Religulous follows political humorist and author Bill Maher (&amp;quot;Real Time With Bill Maher,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Politically Incorrect&amp;quot;) as he travels around the globe interviewing people about God and religion. Known for his astute analytical skills, irreverent wit and commitment to never pulling a punch, Maher brings his characteristic honesty to an unusual spiritual journey. Directed by Larry Charles (Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, &amp;quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&amp;quot;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly: &amp;quot;If you believe, as I do, that religion has been the prime civilizing force in our world, then Religulous may on some level be indefensible. But that's why I'm glad Maher made it. He's scathing, but also curious, and as mischievous an interrogator as Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat... It's a film that's destined to make a lot of people mad, but Maher, for all his showy atheistic ''doubt,'' isn't just trying to crucify religion — he truly wants to know what makes it tick. He leaves no stone tablet unturned.&amp;quot;  A–&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll go to an area restaurant (maybe something other than Cambridge Brewing if the number is low...?)  Note that there will be no Maybe RSVPs or guests.  If you RSVP Yes but change your mind PLEASE change the RSVP as well to give someone else a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your cooperation, and looking forward to seeing you on Sunday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the film I'll be near the front with a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222892165000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Religulous</name><id>8874933</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223237700000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8874933/</event_url></item>
