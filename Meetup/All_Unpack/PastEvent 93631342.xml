Looking out the window right now it may seem like I'm putting a lot of faith in this forecast, but I say let's go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route: &lt;a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=5751503" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=5751503&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 We start out from the Lexington Depot and hit a medium-sized hill right away, just to make sure we are all in the same boat and ready for a 37-mile 12-14mph ride :) Then we head out scenic Marrett Rd, into Lincoln where we hit the biggest climb of the ride, Lincoln Hill (but this time heading in the opposite direction, for those of you on my last ride). The next 7 miles are my favorite part, quietly winding south through Lincoln and Sudbury. We do 1 mile of busy Rt 27 to cross the Sudbury River, and then head north for 10 scenic miles to our rest stop in Concord Center (at the 26-mile mark). Then we finish up with Monument St to Rt 225 to the Minuteman Bikeway back to the Lexington Depot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: &lt;br /&gt;

 Let's meet up at 10:30am and be ready to start at 10:45am. Aiming to be back by 2:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where: &lt;br /&gt;

 Lexington Depot, right by the water fountain. Parking is free on Sundays in the big lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who: &lt;br /&gt;

 You need to be okay with a 12-14 mph average pace, and some significant hills. We will wait for everyone at the top of major hills and at confusing intersections, but otherwise we want to keep a decent pace going.&lt;/p&gt;
