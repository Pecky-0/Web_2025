We can do a loop for an hour or two (2-3 miles or so). It's relatively flat and close to home, if you live in the Nashua area. You will need to supply your own snowshoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The park is dog friendly, but dogs must be on a leash. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Park  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine Falls Park is a 325 acre park located near the heart of the City on the Nashua River. The name &amp;quot;Mine Falls&amp;quot; derives from the low quality lead which was mined from the islands below the Falls in the 1700s. A centerpiece of the park is the three-mile long, man-made canal built in the early 1800s to power the Nashua Mills. The park is great for hiking or biking and has 20 miles of multi-use trails that are on mostly level terrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Park Entrance: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exit 6 off Everett Turnpike/Route 3 in Nashua. Turn Right off of the exit. Turn onto Coliseum Drive, AFTER the Christmas Tree Shop/Kohl's shopping mall. The NH State Liquor store will be on your right in .25 miles. Follow Coliseum Dr. to the parking lot at end of road, past Hannaford's (approx. 1 mile from turn).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at Lincoln Park Entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeff</member_name><member_id>2268166</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robert</member_name><member_id>4121028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1204571191000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204384474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Snowshoe: Mine Falls Park</name><id>7439055</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1204398000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/7439055/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/3/9/global_2914153.jpeg</photo_url></item>
