The menu is unfortunately not online, but the main brunch selections range in price from $9.00 - $15.00, with a selection of lower-priced &amp;quot;starter&amp;quot; items also available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brunch seems to always be a popular event with SSDOMG, and Angela and Mike are guessing that the trend will continue as we head to Duxbury to share some holiday cheer with old friends and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sun Tavern&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;500 Congress St., Duxbury&lt;br /&gt;781-837-4100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thesuntavern.com/index.asp" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thesuntave...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, December 28 @ 11:30 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizers:&lt;/b&gt; Mike &amp;amp; Angela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Min/Max:&lt;/b&gt; None at this time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests:&lt;/b&gt; Up to two per member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Fee:&lt;/b&gt; None! As a holiday gift to our members, we are not charging our normal $2.00 event fee! Members and their Guests will only pay for what they order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price Range:&lt;/b&gt; Main Brunch items range from $9.00 - $15.00. &amp;quot;Starter&amp;quot; items which cost less are also available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cash Only Policy:&lt;/b&gt; Please bring cash! Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over two years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps us to keep things simple for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RSVP Deadline:&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, December 27 @ 5:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions (Credit to Sun Tavern website):&lt;/b&gt; The Sun Tavern is located on Route 14 (Congress Street) in Duxbury. &lt;b&gt;From Route 3&lt;/b&gt;, their website gives directions as follows: &amp;quot;Take Route 3...to Exit 11 in Duxbury.
