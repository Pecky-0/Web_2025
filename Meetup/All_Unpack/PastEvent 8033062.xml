But, I guess lunch is a safe bet. Also, some people would like to know the place of meeting before they can RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's all meet and greet for a casual lunch for our first meetup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been to Punjabi Palace and enjoyed their food.  Here's their website for more information. www.punjabpalace.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If any of you have suggestions..bring them on! We need more participation...I would love to hear from everybody. I'm charging $1.00USD to cover membership charges.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be the one holding the meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216614716000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><why>You'll get to meet other Indians in a cool, casual environment and have a blast.</why><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212033136000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Indian Friends First Meetup</name><id>8033062</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212858000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/8033062/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/9/global_4274761.jpeg</photo_url></item>
