&lt;p&gt;I realize this meetup falls on a weekday night, but that is when the Chinese New Year falls this year. With dinner at 6:30, you can still get home early enough to relax :) It is also a good way to greet Friday..the next day! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**There will be a $2.00 meetup fee for this event.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rena</member_name><member_id>5082966</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296922776000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Feb 3 is the Chinese New Year.....lets ring in the year of the rabbit, with a wonderful chinese food dinner at the Royal Palace in New Haven.
