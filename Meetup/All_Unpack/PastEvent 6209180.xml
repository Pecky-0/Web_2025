We will meet at 10:30 AM, at the Exeter Public Library at 1 Founders Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literature, lists and all necessary materials will be provided, so please join us to spread the good news in the town that birthed the Republican party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that don't know, in a lit drop, you drive from door to door dropping off literature about Ron Paul, and offering to answer questions.  The addresses are chosen based on past voting records, so it's a very targetted method of campaigning.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>10</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189521054000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187567958000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Exeter Lit Drop</name><id>6209180</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189261800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/6209180/</event_url></item>
