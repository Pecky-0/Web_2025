The security officer will direct attendees to the correct floor. There is parking available in the building. Parking is free on the street in front of the building at 6 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 7:00 PM PHP Meetup Organizer Michael Bourque will reprise his presentation &amp;quot;How To Design a Website Without A Single Line of Code&amp;quot;.  Michael will demo &lt;a href="http://balsamiq.com" target="_blank"&gt;Balsamiq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mockupstogo.net" target="_blank"&gt;MockupsToGo.&lt;/a&gt;net (a library of interfaces to be used with Balsamiq), &lt;a href="http://snagit.com" target="_blank"&gt;SnagIt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://napkee.com" target="_blank"&gt;Napkee &lt;/a&gt;(an application that generates HTML/CSS/JS and Adobe Flex3 from a Balsamiq file).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attended the March Boston PHP Meetup and I can personally tell you that what can be accomplished with the medley of these tools is amazing. I definitely wished I had used them when originally designing SocialGrow.com in my mind last fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly believe this may be the most important BizSpark Meetup of the year for people looking to launch a startup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the presentation | demonstration, we will go around the room introducing ourselves and asking the group for advice | opinions on any startup-related issues members are facing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft will provide pizza. What a generous organization! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and bring guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Marsh Sutherland&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marsh Sutherland</member_name><member_id>3795141</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Bourque</member_name><member_id>5046031</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275608208000</updated><rating><average>4.78000020981</average><count>18</count></rating><group><who>BOSSparkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-BizSpark-Meetup</urlname><id>1535927</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston BizSpark Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>74</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269260083000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>How To Design A Site Without Code: Demo of Balsamiq, SnagIt, MockupsToGo, Napkee</name><id>12954114</id><headcount>74</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273186800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-BizSpark-Meetup/events/12954114/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/7/global_11095623.jpeg</photo_url></item>
