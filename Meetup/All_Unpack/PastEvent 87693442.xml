I know I'm a relative newcomer to the Indie Rock Boston group, and I don't want to just use this group as a platform to promote my own shite, but I'm really excited about a show my group, Lowman, has coming up at Toad Sat. Oct. 27th. We do a mix of originals (some of which you can hear on our EP at &lt;a href="http://lowman.bandcamp.com/"&gt;http://lowman.bandcamp.com/&lt;/a&gt; ) and some choice covers of folks like the Police, Ben Folds, Squeeze, Love and Rockets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I'm excited for is our set of Halloween-inspired musical &lt;br /&gt;

 explorations. This will be a cohesive group of songs that fit with the theme of Halloween but transcend the traditional pandering of the "Monster Mash" and "Ghostbusters theme" variety. We will seamlessly drift from one haunting song to another; covers, a few originals, as well as referencing themes from various movies &amp;amp; TV shows. We're still rehearsing &amp;amp; refining the whole set, but it's shaping up to be a very cool thing. So if you're not doing anything that night, come on by. (I know there's a meet-up for Nouvelle Vague that night that I wish I could go to, but if you want to, feel free to swing by after that show).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toad is small, but I still wanna pack the place (it's our 1st time playing there and I want them to invite us back ;) ), and there's no cover, so if you hate it, you'll only have wasted your time, not your money. Our portion starts at 10; I'll be there at 9 at the latest to catch the group before and get set up and everything, if anyone wants to meet up earlier than that either at Toad or next door at Christopher's, lemme know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some video of the group, too:&lt;/p&gt;
