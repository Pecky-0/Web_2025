Alfred that is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brattle is screening a series of Hitchcock double-features in early September. Yes, two movies for the price of one. And while most of us have seen many of The Master of Suspense's films, they really deserve to be seen on the big screen. Rear Window will be playing with Vertigo- wow, now that's what I call a great double-feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brattle's schedule for that day is :&lt;br /&gt;Rear Window at 4:30  and&lt;br /&gt;Vertigo at 2:00 and 7:00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group has already had an event this year featuring Vertigo and so we will be having our post-movie discussion after the 4:30 screening of Rear Window. &lt;b&gt;If you plan on staying for the 7:00 PM screening of Vertigo please indicate so when you RSVP so I can plan accordingly for our restaurant reservation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are links to the films' original trailers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rear Window: &lt;a href="http://www.spike.com/video/rear-window-trailer/2672300" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.spike.com/...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;have to watch the advertisement first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vertigo: &lt;a href="http://www.spike.com/video/trailer/2672314" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.spike.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, back in the day, the large American Studios could produce some films that were entertaining, challenging and had subject matter for adults (!). If you are unfamiliar with either of these Hitchcock classics, here are their descriptions from the All-Movie Guide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rear Window: &lt;a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;amp;sql=1:40584" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.allmovie.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vertigo: &lt;a href="http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;amp;sql=1:52324" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.allmovie.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to those who can spot  A. Hitchcock's cameo in each of these films. No cheating if you already know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, we'll be going to a local restaurant for our group discussion after the 4:30 screening of Rear Window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it,&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be near the front row at the film's end holding a Meetup Sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220993022000</updated><rating><average>4.88000011444</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219882029000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hitchcock's Rear Window</name><id>8635762</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220819400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/8635762/</event_url></item>
