Although it is good to recycle and eliminate toxic waste,  it also helps to understand that the earth is a living being with specific networks of energy flows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will learn about stewardship of the earth from a perspective that includes the current challenge to restore the earth's natural organic energy circulatory system.  Planetary stewardship includes becoming knowledgeable enough to facilitate the repair of existing damage to earth's vital life current flows, as necessary to balance the energies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be introduced to hidden stressors which could trigger a pole shift unless more attention is given to this generally unknown situation.  These cyclically recurring stressors, not yet known by mainstream science, have been described in detail in ancient documents which had been cloistered to protect their integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could be more important?  Pole shifts have occured in the past, each time wiping out all life on the surface.  This information is not given out in order to frighten us.   It is given out so that we can WAKE  UP  IN  TIME  to take appropriate action to prevent that... as the planetary stewards humans were intended to be!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Aalia Kusmis</member_name><member_id>7978464</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276264664000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Co-Creative Planetary Stewards</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Back-to-Basics</urlname><id>1438479</id><group_lat>43.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.6200027466</group_lon><name>Back to Basics: Sustainable Self-Sufficient Healthy Living</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272038324000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Surprising Secrets of PlanetaryStewardship</name><id>13269183</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276209000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Back-to-Basics/events/13269183/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/e/3/global_8253811.jpeg</photo_url></item>
