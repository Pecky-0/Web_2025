They swear this restaurant has the best sushi they have ever eaten, even though they both spent many years in California before coming to CT. They also have hibachi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly and Kate have warned us that this looks like a sushi restaurant you wouldn't want to step foot in, but that the food is unbelievable. So don't be discouraged by the fact that it is in the East Brook Mall (next to the movie theater). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a rave review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ctnow.com/dining/reviews/hce-calfood0928.artsep28,0,5032714.story?coll=hce-headlines-diningrevs" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ctnow.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177629098000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Dining Out</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-271</urlname><id>258190</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Ethnic Dining Enthusiasts Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173465928000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Taste of Asia--Asian Bistro in Mansfield/Willimantic</name><id>5553199</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177455600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-271/events/5553199/</event_url></item>
