It is right off Rte 93 (see map). Park in the main parking lot, and Rufus, Ron and I (Karla) will be waiting there. The Sheepfold itself is a large grassy open area with some picnic tables scattered around in it. We will meet at or near the closest table to the parking lot. There are many pathways and trails leading off the Sheepfold. We'll walk across the open area to a path along the shore of a lake, where the terrain is mostly pine needles (easy walking). Then we can either retrace our steps or make a loop back to the Sheepfold, depending on how we and the doggies feel. Rain will cancel this meetup! But the weather predicted for Sat. is *mostly sunny*. I realize this is pretty short notice, but one of us said Nov 12 was the only day she could do so I decided to give it a try. There will also be a meetup later this month.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karla Rab</member_name><member_id>10717717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321219756000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320943081000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Walk around the Sheepfold and explore a beautiful path by a lake.</name><id>40689702</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321113600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/40689702/</event_url></item>
