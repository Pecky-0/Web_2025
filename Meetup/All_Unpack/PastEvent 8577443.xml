The season is coming to a close quickly and many will be putting their scooters away by this time next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Diesel Cafe is a perfect &amp;quot;bat cave&amp;quot; for the club, with A/C, great food and drink and lots of seating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting promptly at 6:30 and chatting over a bite, then heading out for an easy ride through parts of arlington up Mass ave. and back over to Spy pond or other location for a stretch and time to hang out as the sun sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's power in numbers and lots of fun too, so I hope you will join us in welcoming our newest CityScoot members and hanging out with some older ones too. From now on this meeting will be the monthly meetup for both scooter groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have the club's business cards on hand, so if you have not gotten any yet to help promote the club, come get em!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Scooters outside</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Shoemaker</member_name><member_id>3108784</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221085971000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Twisted Tourists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Scooters</urlname><id>379328</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Twisted Touring</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1219168085000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meet &amp; Greet</name><id>8577443</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220913000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Scooters/events/8577443/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/5/global_5217349.jpeg</photo_url></item>
