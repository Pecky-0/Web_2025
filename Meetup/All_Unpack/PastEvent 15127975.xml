<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Let's blow away the cobwebs of Saturday's Halloween Parties with a brisk pedal through the countryside. We'll be back before the trick-or-treaters come out.&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at my place in Chaplin Center and head out for an hour to an hour-and-a-half of biking on small roads and forest roads, with bright leaves and autumn air. We'll be going via pretty backroads down to the Mansfield Hollow recreation area, explore their a bit on dirt trails, then head home. There's only one steep hill going the uphill way. We are not serious bikers so there's no pressure to be ultra-fast or fit (people have been known to push their bikes up longer hills) and simply enjoy the scenery and the whoosh :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>White colonial house in the historic district.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Northrop</member_name><member_id>8657197</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288619750000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287238804000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Halloweeny Casual Bike Ride (rescheduled from Oct 16th)</name><id>15127975</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288548000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/15127975/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_6487468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
