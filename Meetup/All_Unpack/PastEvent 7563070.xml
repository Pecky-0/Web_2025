<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The first day of spring is upon us and what better way to celebrate the Spring Equinox than to play frisbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be meeting at 8PM on Russell Field (next to Alewife Station). We'll play from about 8-10PM and then go out for food and drinks. Before attending our events, please review our &lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/about/"&gt;About Us.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd recommend you bring a light-colored shirt for visibility's sake and a change of clothes. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, frisbee batteries, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/IRMLHWE8OGKZ"&gt;Amazon Wishlist&lt;/a&gt; to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your optional donations are certainly appreciated! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=russell+field&amp;amp;near=Cambridge,+MA&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;cid=0,0,3047228862203817381&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=image"&gt;Russell Field Map&lt;/a&gt;. Should you decide to take the red line to Alewife, look for signs upon exiting that will direct you to Russell Field (back entrance). Free parking is also available at the Summer Shack, located on the Alewife Parkway across from the entrance to Rindge Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions about our group, don't hesitate to contact our Organizers! See you on the field!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Other Jim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  Because it's spring, this might be our last chance to play where the thermometer dips below freezing.  So come on out and play until the frisbee has to be removed from our cold dead hands (hint: bring gloves)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim Chea</member_name><member_id>4415505</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206317432000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>In celebration of the Vernal Equinox, we're going to have some spring time frisbee fun.</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205940252000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Spring Illuminated Ultimate - Russell Field</name><id>7563070</id><headcount>31</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206144000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7563070/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/d/c/global_3460060.jpeg</photo_url></item>
