<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Putnam has it's river fire event Aug 11, with Little Big Band (swing) playing in the park. I am thinking we could convene at my house around 3pm for refreshments, food, and games then carpool on to Putnam together. The event there starts at 6 pm.  If it's raining, we can just stay and play!  This is a mulit-group event so there will be others coming from other groups as well.  Fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marion buteau</member_name><member_id>12445225</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344722550000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>CardBoard Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-CardBoard-Players-Club</urlname><id>1390924</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The CardBoard Players Club of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342753818000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rain or shine!
