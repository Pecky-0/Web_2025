Do you want to know more about Plone, Zope, and Python?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come and meet other Plone users and developers at the Boston Plone users group. We will gather monthly to talk about how we are using Plone, share knowledge and give demonstrations of cool Plone products. All skill levels are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have specific topics that you'd like to discuss, please post them in the discussion forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this meeting, Rob Baker - webmaster at Oxfam America (www.oxfamamerica.org) will demonstrate how to skin a Plone site including modifying the Plone CSS files, and do file system based development using DIYPloneStyle. The example skin he will be demonstrating is for the new bostonplone.org website. This will kick-off our group effort to build a community site for Plone enthusiasts in the Boston area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fourth floor at 60 Canal Street right near North Station.  Seth will have someone stationed to direct people where to go. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate Aune</member_name><member_id>58579</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540180000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Plonista</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonplone</urlname><id>207992</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Plone Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1144519736000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Plone April Meetup</name><id>4896205</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1146178800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonplone/events/4896205/</event_url></item>
