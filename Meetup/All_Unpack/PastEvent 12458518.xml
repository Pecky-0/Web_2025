Expect to hike at a pace of our slowest hiker.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have our own individual pace and experience. We have many organizers that offer many levels of hiking to allow you options of experience and a pace that is comfortable for you.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in this hike you will have to join the waiting list this will allow us to make sure that we know your abilities and have proper gear.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt Adams - 5774' The northern Presidentials are dominated by Mt Adams, the second highest peak in NH.   &lt;br /&gt;Mt Madison - 5367 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting we plan on hiking to the summit of Mt Adams via Valley Way trail. Valley Way takes us very close to Mt Madison, so we can summit Madison as well. The group pace will be moderate, taking breaks as needed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiking Trails: We decided to take Valley Way trail we will have less exposure to the elements and we  will have a chance to get both peaks. &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Valley Way is a direct, moderate,weather-resistant route that ends within yards of reliable shelter at the AMC Madison Hut. In bad weather, this relatively safe trail is also an ideal escape route from the exposed northern summits. If you need more incentive to select this hike consider, too, that the most magnificent view in all the White Mountains waits at the end of the path.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare for full winter conditions! This is an advance level hike.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want good weather: low winds and clear skies for this effort. Make sure to watch for cancellations and date changes. Please list your contact information in the questionnaire. An nearby alternate lower elevation hike will be planned for backup  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>ken hodges</member_name><member_id>8561025</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269347973000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264776147000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Adams and Mt Madison VIA Valley Way Trail</name><id>12458518</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269174600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/12458518/</event_url></item>
