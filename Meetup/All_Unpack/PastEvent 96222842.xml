We'll begin with a potluck feast as we gather between 6 - 7:30 in a cozy private apartment, and move into the ritual space we create together by 8. Our ritual will finish by 10, then participants are welcome to linger for tea and more time together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions to include in the ritual are warmly welcomed, ahead of time here or as we create sacred space together. We will invoke the directions and cast a circle, do some chanting and healing and....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to bring your own sit-upon and items for the altar we will build together. (They will return with you, charged .)&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Address in Washington Square will be sent to those who rsvp.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maiyim</member_name><member_id>63013452</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1364001253000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Goddess</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>goddess-327</urlname><id>1289522</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Goddess Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356152177000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Women Circle on the 'cross-quarter' between Winter Solstice and Spring Equinox.</name><id>96222842</id><headcount>12</headcount><duration>14400000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1359846000000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/goddess-327/events/96222842/</event_url></item>
