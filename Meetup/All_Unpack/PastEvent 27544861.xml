We need big rallies in all locations, at LEAST every 3 weeks if we can (every 2 weeks would be great!) We'll pick a different location each time and then a pot luck lunch (if anyone is so inclined to host) or a pizza party afterward. This will give everyone a chance to meet members they have not had the chance to yet...it's nice to be able to put a face and a personality to those you may be communicating with on the website or through e-mails. This is a great location with plenty of parking and it's TAX FREE HOLIDAY weekend so the shoppers will be out and about! Sandi has offered to host this first gathering so join us, please!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna R.</member_name><member_id>8973743</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1313361137000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>We Surround Them</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Western-Mass-912-Project</urlname><id>1394602</id><group_lat>42.2000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6299972534</group_lon><name>The Original WMass 912 Project</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311980832000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>IT'S SUPER RALLY TIME!!!!</name><id>27544861</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313244000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Western-Mass-912-Project/events/27544861/</event_url></item>
