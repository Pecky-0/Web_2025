I sugguest that we meet in front of the escalators in the lobby by the front door at 7:15, with your tickets.  Please be aware this is opening weekend and is probably going to be crazy....you might want to buy your ticket ahead.  If you are not in the Boston area, you can go to Fandango and buy on-line.  I already did.  I have been to other meetups where the show was sold out, so don't be left out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of places in the area you might want to go for a bite to eat/drinks to socialize a bit and discuss the movie after the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165883059000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1163693084000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Holiday--Cameron Diaz &amp; Kate Winslet</name><id>5272178</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165709700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/5272178/</event_url></item>
