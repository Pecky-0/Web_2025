&lt;p&gt;Tim's songs cover a lot of ground -- rock, americana, folk and blues -- with gritty, funny, soulful, hard driving originals mixed in with eclectic covers.  (The Coasters' "Youngblood", anyone?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim's also a terrific guitar player and his band is extraordinary.  The typical lineup:  Lou Ulrich on bass, Sean Staples on "rock'n'roll mandolin", Andy Plaisted on drums, Scott Aruda on trumpet, Paul Ahlstrand on sax (tenor and bari), and Russell Chudnovsky on slide guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cover is $7 cash at the door, but trust me:  it's the best $7 you'll spend all week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housekeeping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to hear Tim's music? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Go to his Facebook page, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Listen-to-Tim-Gearan/124652810944642"&gt;Listen to Tim Gearan&lt;/a&gt;, and click on the 'Music' link. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atwood's is on the small side, so I'm limiting attendance for this Meetup. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned above, there's a $7 cover charge. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 You must pay the cover even if you arrive early -- e.g., for dinner.  The doormen will hunt you down and wrestle you for the money.... &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The music starts 10:30ish; I'll be there at 9pm. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Musicians must keep time when playing ... but they're not always Real Good about starting on time, so consider 10:30 a broad hint.  But please come early to meet your fellow music lovers.  Also, Atwood's does occasionally sell out, so coming early gets you in the door. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll send my cell # to all Yes RSVPs early in the evening before the show. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 When I send the email with my cell #, I'll also include notes about parking (always a challenge in Cambridge).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at Atwood's!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be hanging at the end of the bar farthest from the door.
