How about a spontaneous lunch meeting at Central Kitchen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was there recently and overheard several people chatting en Francais at the next table. It was quiet enough in the back to have a conversation- so, if anyone can make it, I'll be there tomorrow from 1 to 2p! I have the downloaded flashcards on my laptop, and the pinyin lyrics to 2 Elva popsongs  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Central Kitchen's a block from the REd Line T (on Mass Ave opposite PEarl St) and there's metered parking lots right behind the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're open from 12:30 to 2:30 for lunch i think, so if a bit earlier or later is better for you, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>reece</member_name><member_id>1920240</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Boston Mandarin Meetup Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>chinese-35</urlname><id>33097</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Mandarin Chinese Language Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1109090516000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wed 2/23 Central Sq lunch chat!</name><id>4290949</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1109181600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/chinese-35/events/4290949/</event_url></item>
