It‘s always a delight to talk with him and attend his presentations. This DVD is full of so much great information, some it actually is very shocking. Great information along with some good dry humor this DVD can easily be watched over and over again! I can’t wait for you all to see so we can discuss it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re not familiar with Michael Greger, M.D., he is a physician, author, and internationally recognized professional speaker on a number of important public health issues and serves as the Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States. &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Greger is also licensed as a general practitioner specializing in clinical nutrition and was a founding member of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Greger was featured on the Healthy Living Channel promoting his latest nutrition DVD and honored to teach part of Dr. T.
