 Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones &lt;br /&gt;

 Located in the: Special Exhibition Galleries &lt;br /&gt;

 Explore the delightful realm of hats - wildly plumed bonnets, silk turbans, sequined caps, embroidered crowns, Sarah Jessica Parker's lime-green fascinator and 250 other elegant and sometimes outlandish styles. Displayed with the wit and whimsy of British milliner-to-the-stars Stephen Jones, Hats reveals the boundless creativity of hat design and our own fascination with wearing these indescribable works of art. Support provided by the East India Marine Associates (EIMA) of the Peabody Essex Museum. Exhibition organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.Media PartnerImages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admission to the Museum is $12 for our group and the Hat exhibit is included in that price.  Due to winter weather, may I suggest that we stay inside at the museum for lunch?  Take a look their menu for the Atrium Cafe when u have a moment on their website.  The prices are very reasonable and we may remain at our destination w/out having to make a trek to another location in the cold weather.  I hope you all agree, but if you have a suggestion... I'm open.   I WILL MAKE OUR RESERVATIONS W/MY CREDIT CARD AS PEM WILL NOT ACCEPT SINGLE PAYMENTS FROM A GROUP SITUATION.  NO PROBLEM.  PLS PAY ME BY CASH OR CHECK MADE OUT TO DONNA GARIAN FOR $12 WHEN WE MEET AT THE EVENT.  SEE YOU ALL SOON!&lt;/p&gt;
