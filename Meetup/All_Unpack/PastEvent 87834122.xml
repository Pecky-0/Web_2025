<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Meeting at the Women's Federated Forest and hiking in to Soapstone Hill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Signage is small but very close to the town lines for New Salem and Petersham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;It's quite a drive to reach the parking lot....maybe 1 1/2 - 2 miles in, just a guess.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;This is an easy to moderate hike from the Women's Federated Forest to a nice ridge trail to reach the summit of Soapstone Hill. I'd like to take a lunch break at the summit of Soapstone Hill while we take in the views of the Quabbin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;We can return either back along the ridge trail or descend down from Soapstone Hill, walk along the reservoir and return via gate 36 of the Quabbin which is a bit longer. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;Total hike time with break will be approximately 2-2 1/2 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #800000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;There is limited parking yet if we fill it up and still need some more space, we can find alternate parking nearby and will attend to that if it happens. There are other spots we can park in withing the WFF or just down the street at Quabbin Gate 35 on Old Dana Road if we have to&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #008000 ; font-size : medium"&gt;I have this posted on three local meetup sites so we'll see what happens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Federation of Women's Club State Forest lies in Petersham and New Salem on Route 122. Its 984 acres stretch to the south and west in the watershed of the Quabbin Reservoir. Please Note that NO pets are allowed on DCR Watershed Property. Groves of pine and stands of maple, birch and hemlock invite the visitor along the wooded roads. The road along Fever Brook is outstanding for its scenery. A wildlife sanctuary compromising 140 acres has been set aside in the center of the forest, and a dam on Fever Brook holds back sufficient water to attract migrating and native wild fowl. In the southwest section is the forest's chief geological feature, the Gorge.&lt;/p&gt;
