If you'd like to set aside a chunk of time to work on or finish your pages, or even drop them off for delivery to Rozsi, this is your chance. (Reminder: The deadline for Rozsi to receive them is SEPT. 1. That's SOON!!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, there's no agenda. Arrive and leave when you want. Work on other projects, if you prefer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AMENITIES:&lt;/b&gt; Free parking. Air conditioning! Table space and a chair. Access to some tools (paper cutter, heat gun, etc.). Access to a fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kitchen sink and restroom; access to Wi-Fi if you need to use your computer while you're there. And did I mention air conditioning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COST:&lt;/b&gt; $5, regardless of how long you stay. If people are interested in dinner, we can get take-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO MAY ATTEND:&lt;/b&gt; Any member of the NE ATC+ Meetup Group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO SIGN UP:&lt;/b&gt; You must RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; using Meetup's RSVP function so we know who's coming and how many to expect. If your plans change, PLEASE switch your RSVP to “no” ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you -- and your pages -- on Sunday!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252861372000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251138109000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>8/30 "For the Birds" Open Studio at ArtStudio 360, Holliston </name><id>11187849</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251648000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/11187849/</event_url></item>
