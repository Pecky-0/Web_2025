One of them is EFT, the Emotional Freedom Technique.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With EFT you tap on energy meridian points on your body, and make releasing statements as you do so.  Mark has found a way to use EFT to move out of an issue of resistance/feeling &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; into a perfect state of allowing -connecting to Joy, Laughter, Praise, Beauty, Love, Inspiration, Well-Being and Freedom.  These align with &amp;quot;Abraham's&amp;quot; version of a 10 commandments.  They don't call them commandments.  Instead they call them verbal offerings of that which they have found to be a very good way of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll share these &amp;quot;offerings&amp;quot; with you, and teach you the EFT process; so you can leave with a new method for feeling really, really, really good!  Of course, we'll actually practice it during the meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate to only rsvp &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; if you know you are really planning on attending, and also let us know if your plans change.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to come early to have extra time for chatting; and we're happy to hang out afterward, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to playing and learning together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann and Mark&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be upstairs.
