This month's meetup is focused on matching developers and engineers with entrepreneurs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At our recent meetups, many entrepreneurs have voiced the need to find exceptional developers and technical co-founders. With that in mind, I'd like to invite developers/engineers that are interested in working on start-ups or co-founding a start-up to attend, bring friends, and bring something to showcase your expertise such as a resume or functioning work samples. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an entrepreneur looking for an engineer or a technical co-founder, this should be a good opportunity to promote your start-up and hopefully convince some great engineering talent to join you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recap:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The April Meetup is about matching engineers/developers with entrepreneurs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engineers/developers: bring resumes, work samples, friends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurs: bring a good product pitch to help you recruit great engineering talent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and where:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The April WebSquared meetup is this Thursday, April 29, starting at 8PM at the Cambridge Brewing Company. We usually have a table or two in the front, to the left of the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there, and I hope we can make some connections happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;Sergio&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sergio Paluch</member_name><member_id>10180754</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272758671000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Predictive Hackers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Predictive-Analytics</urlname><id>1506004</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Hacking Predictive Analytics App</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272305826000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WebSquared April Meetup - Matching Engineers with Entrepreneurs</name><id>13296034</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272585600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Predictive-Analytics/events/13296034/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/e/global_10177342.jpeg</photo_url></item>
