I am planning the outdoor bistro again but if the weather does not cooperate we will move inside :).    Everyone bring a dish of your choice!  When you have decided what you want to bring list it on the message board so we don't get 15 of the same salad!  Salad is great just not all the same!  If people are really stuck give me a shout and I will help with ideas.   You don't have to do anything elaborate or crazy....just please make it organic.  KO's is a safe place to eat...no added chemicals!  I hope to see all old and new members!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249687800000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244246759000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food July Meetup</name><id>10587435</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247266800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/10587435/</event_url></item>
