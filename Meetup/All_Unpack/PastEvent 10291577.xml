<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This day hike is a section hike on the Appalachian Trail in New Hampshire &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a moderate 6-7 mile day hike starting at the Gilmans Corner trailhead on NH-25A, heading west over Mt. Cube (2,911) and ending at Quinttown Rd. This is a continuation of the Mt. Mist AT Section Hike held on May 3rd. Our route will take us over Mt Cube and the Eastman Ledges (2,200), before crossing the north and south branches of Jacobs Brook. After crossing the south branch of Jacobs brook, we’ll do an easy ½ mile bushwack out to our reverse shuttle. There is the potential for your feet to get wet on these stream crossings, so consider bringing a second pair of lightweight trail crossing shoes that provide good ankle stability. Hiking poles are also recommended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trip will run rain or shine. Please do not sign up if you’re going to pull out due to rain. Hiking in rain builds character and is a great way to test your rain gear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trip will begin on Saturday morning, May 23 at 8:30 AM at the trailhead on NH 25-A in Gilmans Corner (New Hampshire, Zip 03777). Look for the AT Signs (Hikers Crossing) and park along the road. There is space for 4 or 5 cars. We will run a shuttle to the intersection of Quinttown Rd and Mousey Brook Rd and return to Gilmans Corner to start our hike. The trip ends after we reach Quinntown Rd and run the reverse shuttle to Gilmans Corner to pick up our other car(s). Please be prompt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Gilmans Corner (New Hampshire Zip 03777) Trailhead on NH-25A:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Boston: I93N to exit 26.
