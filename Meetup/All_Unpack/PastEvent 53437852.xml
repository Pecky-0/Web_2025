&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Los Andes restaurant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So several P-Collective members have been here and raved about it. They were also at the I Heart Providence event earlier this month giving away free samples which were fabulous!!! Brothers Cesin and Omar Curi are the owners of this Bolivian restaurant specializing in the amazing Peruvian and Bolivian cuisine. With a knowledgeable and friendly staff, amazing food at really great prices and one of the best caipirinhas I've had in Rhode Island - this is definitely one to know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meetup will be limited to 20 people due to the size of the bar but we will have it all to ourselves. Drink specials are in the works and I'll have more information tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
