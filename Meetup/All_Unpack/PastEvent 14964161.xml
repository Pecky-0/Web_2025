All dance levels are welcome, particularly beginner. We went to their last one in May and it was a lot of fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday, October  from 8-11 pm at Springstep in Medford, Dance&lt;br /&gt;Caliente will be hosting their quarterly dance party, &amp;quot;A Night&lt;br /&gt;Out with Dance Caliente!&amp;quot;  Dance Caliente's parties are lovely,&lt;br /&gt;low-key, and comfortable events. More like a cafe than a&lt;br /&gt;nightclub, their parties feature a wide range of Latin, Swing &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;Ballroom dance music, short lessons, and complimentary coffee,&lt;br /&gt;tea and desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are usually $15, but we our tickets will be $11 (cash at the door). We will also have some tables set aside for the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet inside the entrance area, if you have trouble finding us, or running late, please call Catherine at 774 232 0000. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Catherine (see photo) inside entrance.
