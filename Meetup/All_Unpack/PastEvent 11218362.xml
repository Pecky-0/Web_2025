More than two decades of research strongly suggest that a recently introduced fungal disease was largely responsible for this biodiversity catastrophe. More recently and closer to home, bats have been dying in droves in the caves and mines of their eastern United States wintering sites. Again, the most likely suspect is a recently introduced fungal disease. Biologists were tragically slow to accept a disease as the principal cause of frog disappearances and even slower to act. Can bat biologists learn from these mistakes? Is it possible to intervene to help wildlife populations threatened by disease?&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>russ</member_name><member_id>1445816</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1253227348000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251405816000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>science for the public at the bpl - fragility of ecological systems</name><id>11218362</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253053800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11218362/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/6/global_10134358.jpeg</photo_url></item>
