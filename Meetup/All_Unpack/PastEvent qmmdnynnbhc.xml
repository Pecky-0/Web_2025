We will start the group by sharing insights and epiphanies we've experienced, then listening to a recorded talk about mindfulness, which lasts about one hour. This week's talk will be &amp;quot;Spontaneous Meditation: The Sacred Art of Presencing&amp;quot; by Lama Surya Das, noted author and teacher of Buddhist philosophy and practice. A self proclaimed &amp;quot;Long Island Jewish Buddhist&amp;quot;, we think you'll enjoy his clear presentation and sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our talk will follow with a short meditation and discussion about the content and our experiences. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world. We always have a nice group of people and would love to have you join us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1288112720000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Talk: Lama Surya Das</name><id>qmmdnynnbhc</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1288044000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/15169566/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
