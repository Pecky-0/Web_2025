See you on the 1st!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT BRIAN AND JODY CALVI and FARM OF LIFE, COSTA RICA&lt;br /&gt;Jody and Brian Calvi are fellow raw food travelers who found great benefit in raw food.  They will present about their lives' journeys and passion for raw food and will share information about their Natural Healing Center in Costa Rica - Farm of Life.  They inject humor, motivation, and are real about who they are and what they've experienced.   &lt;br /&gt;Brian and Jody had profound healing journeys.  Jody was sick with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis since 18-months of age, and Brian struggled with Fibrolyalgia in his adult years.  They found their way to each other and the Living Foods Lifestyle.  They failed with traditional medicine, climbed the proverbial mountain and learned a better way.  Their gratitude for getting back their health has culminated in Farm of Life, the Vacation for the Healthy Lifestyle and Natural Healing Center in Costa Rica (www.farmoflifecr.com).  They feel their higher purpose is to help anyone struggling with disease return to health, and to teach others the miraculous healing capacity of the body &lt;br /&gt;The-Vacation-for-the-Healthy Lifestyle is a new twist on an old idea.  Healthy vacations generally take the form of a health spa.  Farm of Life is different. Healing involves rest, nourishing food, physical exertion, fresh air, rejuvenating water, and a life-giving sun. Guests thrive on delicious raw and vegetarian cuisine with fresh, organic ingredients, and revive body and spirit with detoxification, health coaching, yoga, massage, physical exertion, waterfalls, wildlife, beaches, jungle &amp;amp; mountain hikes, and exciting eco-adventures. Farm of Life is a place of immense beauty, amazing healing energy, stunning vistas, and affordable, modern accommodations. &lt;br /&gt;For a preview of Farm of Life, Costa Rica, visit:  &lt;a href="http://www.farmoflifecr.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.farmoflife...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides health transformation, Brian is passionate about fitness, leads cycling tours, is a dynamic workshop facilitator, a former professional tennis player and a reiki master. Brian and Jody are currently studying for a PhD in Natural Health and Nutrition. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286157957000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>24</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285119031000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fri October 1st Meetup!!!
