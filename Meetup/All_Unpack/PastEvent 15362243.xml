Discussion will follow. Free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990, Cuba's economy went into a tailspin. With imports of oil cut by more than half and food imports cut by 80 percent, people were desperate. This fascinating and empowering film shows how communities pulled together, created solutions, and ultimately thrived in spite of their decreased dependence on imported energy. In the context of global Peak Oil worries, Cuba is an inspiring vision of hope. The Community Solution is a nonprofit organization that designs and teaches low-energy solutions to the current unsustainable, fossil fuel-based, industrialized, and centralized way of living.
