I will update this description as more information becomes available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feature presentations:&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;b&gt;Introduction to Ableton Live.&lt;/b&gt; Ableton Live - it's multi-platform, unique among DAWs, and wildly popular. In this presentation, Josh R will demonstrate the distinct approach to composition that Live offers as well as glance at the more traditional features. Luke will demonstrate how Live can be used when performing, well... live!&lt;br /&gt;* &lt;b&gt;Making the track&lt;/b&gt; with Al McDonald (abstract tentative). Our very own Al McDonald will step in detail through the creation, mixing, and mastering of one of his tracks. You'll hear the raw sounds, see how they fit together in the arrangement, how effects are used to add excitement and fit everything into the mix, and how mastering techniques add the last layer of shine to the finished product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please respond or e-mail me (yevster\at\gmail\dot\com) if you would like to &lt;br /&gt;* Do a 5-10 minute &amp;quot;lightning talk&amp;quot; on a tool or technique you're excited about&lt;br /&gt;* Share your music with the rest of the group at the meeting. Both completed projects and works-in-progress are welcome. This is a valuable opportunity to get some good discussion and constructive criticism of your work. E-mail me if you'd like to share your track(s) anonymously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, there will be a book raffle and plenty of opportunities to mix and mingle with your fellow digital musicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yev</member_name><member_id>3234171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291855844000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Music Makers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>musical</urlname><id>413373</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>Music Makers With Relaxed Expectations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290021008000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>December 8th Meeting</name><id>15479129</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291851000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/musical/events/15479129/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/5/9/global_19862905.jpeg</photo_url></item>
