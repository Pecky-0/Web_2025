This is event has been running for 8 years thus far and still continues to be popular among many biking enthusiasts. I will not be attending but Norm said he would take on the task of 'santa' (inside joke), a fine leader if I do say myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experience a car-free Storrow Drive, explore historic neighborhoods, and take in views of the Boston Harbor that you’ve never seen before. &lt;br /&gt;

 The ride starts and finishes on City Hall Plaza in downtown Boston, with three different routes to choose from: 10, 30 and 50 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can sign up on their website. The Registration Fee is $45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: &lt;br /&gt;

 Hub on Wheels is presented by Mayor Menino’s Office of Special Events in cooperation with Boston Bikes. &lt;br /&gt;

 The ride is� fully supported and safe, with three routes:� 10, 30, or 50 miles of harbor views and hidden pathways, river greenways and Boston’s wonderful and eclectic neighborhoods.� Storrow Drive is completely car-free, as is the entire 10 mile route. To reopen Storrow Drive in a timely fashion, anyone not reaching the 10 mile turnaround by 9:30 will be turned back early. Many other roads are open to traffic. &lt;br /&gt;

 Marshals along all routes make sure there’s plenty of space to ride.� Tech support and ride snacks are free of charge. All rules of the road apply. Please ride safely and courteously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding with children: Cyclists must be 10+ years to ride the 10 mile loop, 12+ years to ride the longer loops. Children under 10 may participate only if riding with an adult on a tandem, trail-a-bike, bike seat or trailer. Children under 10 ride for free — no separate registration is required. Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARKING: Everyone receives a coupon for $4 parking at the Government Center Garage [www.governmentcentergarage.com] as part of their registration packet.
