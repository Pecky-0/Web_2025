<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm scheduling this event for Saturday morning and the Single Event group will also be there at the same time so there should be plenty of players.  I will not be able to play or show up due to injuries I sustained in an accident last Friday. Most likely, I'll be out for at least a few weeks and hope to recover as soon as possible.  In the meantime, I'll schedule tennis for those that want to know that something is planned each week.  Keep an eye on the RSVP list.  Have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can reach me at 860-559-7983 with any questions or comments.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I won't be there, darn it!!!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim</member_name><member_id>3660111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217250212000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1216820922000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tennis Saturday @Conard</name><id>8395540</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217077200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/8395540/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_2940738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
