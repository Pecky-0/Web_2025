STICKS!  Chop sticks and Pool (que) sticks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two REALLY fun things to do all within walking distance in Chinatown/Downtown crossing in Boston.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet at 6:30pm Dinner at Shabu Shabu at &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/kaze-shabu-shabu-boston" target="_blank"&gt;Kaze &lt;/a&gt; in Chinatown:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japanese hot pot (SHabu-Shabu) is a really fun and delicious fondue style soup dinner.  Its very healthy and there are all sorts of dinner options including vegetarian.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shabu-shabu was introduced in Japan in the 20th century with the opening of a Shabu-shabu restaurant &amp;quot;Suehiro&amp;quot;[1] in Osaka. Its origins are traced back to the Chinese hot pot known as &amp;quot;shuan yang rou&amp;quot;. Shabu-shabu is most similar to the original Chinese version when compared to other Japanese steamboat dishes (nabemono) such as sukiyaki.   &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu" target="_blank"&gt;Read it all here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;After dinner we will walk around the corner to &lt;a href="http://www.feltclubboston.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Felt &lt;/a&gt;to play some pool&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt is a cool restaurant / billiards / nightclub that really doesn't get packed until late in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;  I will have a table (or two) reserved for us on the second floor.  There is plenty of seating, and waitstaff will take orders for drinks and appetizers. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274030364000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Couples</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostoncouplesmeetup</urlname><id>1053816</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Couples Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270329504000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Party with the STICKS.  </name><id>13078331</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273962600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncouplesmeetup/events/13078331/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/2/6/global_9634902.jpeg</photo_url></item>
