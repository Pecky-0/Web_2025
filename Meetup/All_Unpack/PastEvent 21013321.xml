Do you watch TV? Movies? Listen to Music? Eat? Know a little history? Geography? Sports?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows something about the world and can make a great contribution to the game as well as to the conversations around the tables while we play. Come on out, socialize with the easiest group of people you'll ever make friends with! And, at Doherty's, one of the best beer lists in the city and pretty good food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game starts between 8:30 and 9 and runs for about 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newcomer's team won the last time we were there, so there's a $25 gift certificate that we'll be applying to the bill.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a and be there around 8PM to try to get a table.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1308862426000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1307248963000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Trivia @ Doherty's</name><id>21013321</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1308700800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/21013321/</event_url></item>
