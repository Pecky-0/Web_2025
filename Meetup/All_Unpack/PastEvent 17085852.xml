&lt;p&gt;We will meet at 9:00 AM in the parking lot off Mt Clinton Road. Take the Cog Railway Base Road to get to Mt Clinton Road as it may still be closed from the other direction. According to Google Maps this location is about 167 miles from Boston - it should take about 3 hours 13 minutes to drive there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will follow Edmunds Path to Eisenhower and Crawford Path to Monroe and return the same route. &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This moderate pace hike will cover about 9.8 miles and climb about 3,800 feet &amp;ndash; it is considered INTERMEDIATE because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain. It should take an average hiker about 6 hours 50 minutes to complete this trip. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start as a group, stay as a group, and finish as a group. If you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us or want to head off on your own, this isn't the trip for you. Likewise, this trip isn't for you if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you or want us to go on without you. The goal of this hike is to summit safely, and to do that, everyone in the group needs to be at a similar fitness and experience level. If you have ANY questions about your ability to participate in and complete this entire event please contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. Winter hiking is more strenuous than hiking in the summer. We will assess travel and weather conditions and make changes to our planned trip as necessary - &lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;"Reaching the summit is optional, getting down in mandatory" (Ed Viesturs). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list describing the minimum clothing and equipment required to participate in this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sturdy hiking boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;Micro-spikes and snowshoes&amp;nbsp;until I can determine what snow is left. Bring them with you as they can always be left in the car in not needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic shirt and pants, including at least one insulating layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterproof rain jacket (with hood) and pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-energy snacks, food for lunch and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map and compass. Plastic whistle. Headlamp with two sets of spare batteries. Emergency space blanket (e.g. mylar). Small pocket knife or multi-purpose tool. Trekking poles. Toilet kit (e.g. hand sanitizer, toilet paper and a zip-lock bag to pack out your used personal hygiene items). Sunscreen. Lip balm. Waterproof cover for your pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a group first aid kit that contains basic items but you will need to bring any personal medications or medical supplies that you may need during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
