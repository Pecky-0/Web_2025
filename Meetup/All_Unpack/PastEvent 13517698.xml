A pre-world cup warm up with two of Europe's biggest teams meeting in Madrid to decide the 2010 champions of Europe. This tournament has been dominated by English and Spanish teams in recent seasons but this year sees Bayern Munich of Germany take on Inter Milan of Italy. Both teams have many players who will star in this summer's World Cup and not just for the Italian and German teams; players of many other top nations will be on show including the Netherlands, Argentina and Brazil. Two very experienced managers take charge of these teams: Munich's Louis van Gaal and Milan's Jose Mourinho, the self-proclaimed &amp;quot;special one&amp;quot; with a gift for pre-match mind games. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Liffey's was packed on both floors for this game last year when it was played on a Wednesday afternoon, so expect it to be busy and arrive early (I'll arrive around 2.15pm, the match kicks off at 2.45pm). The atmosphere should be excellent and whet all football fans' excitement for this summer's upcoming World Cup tournament. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul will be your host for this event and can be reached at: 609 356 4028.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/47892000/jpg/_47892539_clfinal466.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/2010_UEFA_Champions_League_Final_logo.jpg/465px-2010_UEFA_Champions_League_Final_logo.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul</member_name><member_id>8344687</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274839337000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1274183684000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Champions' League Final!
