Believe it or not, it&amp;#146;s time to start thinking about next year. What shall we put in the ground? Bring your seed catalogs, favorite crops, new things to try, and we'll discuss garden planning, seed saving and when to order. What is best from seed and what works best as transplants will be part of our conversation. Remember, you don't have to know anything to learn something! The Edible Garden Group was formed by community members who are interested in getting together to learn and share information about sustainable food growing &amp;#150; veggies, fruits, nuts. The meetings are focused on building community resilience through increasing the availability of safe, nutritious, sustainably-grown local food. To learn more visit our website at &lt;a href="http://hyperlocavore.ning.com/group/egg" target="_blank"&gt;http://hyperlocavore....&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to join the discussion on-line.
