I am too much of a wimp to tolerate the cold, but that shouldn't prevent the hardier types from having fun!  Go, have fun, take picture to post on the site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shannon will be at the entrance with a puffy blue coat and green hat, and Ellie is a (mostly) brown Aussie that will be rounding up every dog she sees.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get there take Rt. 66 West out of Northampton past Smith College.  Go over the river and as you crest a hill the road divides.  Take the right onto Prince St. and pass the community gardens on the right.  The parking is the next dirt lot on the right.  You'll probably see cars there, and dogs!  Be careful it is very potholed.  Have fun and stay warm!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Shannon will be at entrance w puffy blue coat, green hat, and Ellie the Aussie!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristi</member_name><member_id>7010444</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233511915000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232120365000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Northampton Dog Park Walk for fans of Chilly Days!</name><id>9537290</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232208000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/9537290/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/c/1/global_4906289.jpeg</photo_url></item>
