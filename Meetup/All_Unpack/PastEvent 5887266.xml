Supervised swimming is offered daily from June 23 to Labor Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spectacle Island visitor center demonstrates renewable energy, oriented with a roofline facing south so a solar electric (photo voltaic) system could be installed with maximum solar gain. These photo voltaic panels produce enough energy to keep a small fleet of electric vehicles operational on the island as well as to send clean electricity to the utility power grid for use throughout the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;short history&lt;br /&gt;We know that people began living on Spectacle Island over a millennium ago, utilizing the abundant resources of aquatic life and shellfish nearby for their survival. The island's name was inspired by the shape of two glacial drumlins or hills, connected by a sand bar, which resembled a pair of spectacles to early European explorers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details to follow regarding where to meet and the cost associated with the ferry.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1184079821000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181754203000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BOSTON HARBOR SPECTACLE ISLAND TOUR</name><id>5887266</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1183906800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/5887266/</event_url></item>
