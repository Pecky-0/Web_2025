The selection we'll be discussing is &amp;quot;The Glass Castle&amp;quot; by Jeannette Walls.  It's been out in paperback for a couple of years but it's received almost universal praise.  It's a memoir that you won't soon forget.  Although I read it almost three years ago, I often think about the difficult life she endured growing up and I've asked myself what part of that life led to a successful career and a seemingly well adjusted life as an adult.  Several of her siblings were scarred by the shared experience but she seems to have survived and flourished.   &lt;br /&gt;      I think you'll really enjoy the book and it should generate some interesting discussion.   &lt;br /&gt;      Several people have asked that we choose books in advance so we've chosen &amp;quot;The Thirteenth Tale&amp;quot; by Diane Setterfield for May (a week early, on the 23rd) and &amp;quot;The Book Thief&amp;quot; by Marcus Zusak for our June meeting. &lt;br /&gt;      Hope to see you all soon.  Happy reading.
