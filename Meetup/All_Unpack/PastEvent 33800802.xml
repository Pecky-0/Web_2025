&lt;p&gt;The eighties were recently voted one of the top three decades in the last thirty years.&amp;nbsp; Come celebrate the music of the adequate eighties at &lt;a href="http://www.burren.com/"&gt;The Burren&lt;/a&gt; in Davis Square.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ScatterShot-Rocks/308372470711"&gt;Scatter Shot&lt;/a&gt; will be playing your favorite tunes of the 80's on &lt;a href="http://www.burren.com/images/Scattershot-L.gif"&gt;L80's Night&lt;/a&gt; with drink specials for the ladies, and $2.00 beers and $3.00 shots for the rest of us.&amp;nbsp; 80's trivia and a singing contest with cash and prizes are the garnish to a great night out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come down for the game and stay as long as you want, or just show-up for the dancing and singing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tufts Meet-up Signs on our table(s).</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321578467000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316186373000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bruins-Bluejackets &amp; 80's Music at the Burren</name><id>33800802</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321574400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/33800802/</event_url></item>
