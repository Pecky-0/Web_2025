That  weekend will be the last time Abbotts will be serving for the 2009 season. We will be having  cocktails  (BYOB) and dinner on the open deck by the marina (watch out  for  sea gulls),  enjoying good conversation and a lot of laughs. That's what Have Fun Will Travel is all about. Come celebrate the last weekend of the summer with  us..... we will be looking forward to seeing you :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The restaurant is actually in Noank which is part of Groton, but the computer would not allow me to plug in NOANK.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a MEETUP SIGN ON THE TABLE.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252360956000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251211760000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ABBOTT'S  LOBSTER IN THE ROUGH</name><id>11195482</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252180800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/11195482/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/d/1/global_10385073.jpeg</photo_url></item>
