<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a roughly 5 mile hike with water views in Mansfield Hollow State Park around the northern end of Mansfield Hollow Lake. We will follow the blue blazed trail that circles the lake. There are two spots of only about .1 mile each where we will have to walk on the shoulder of a road but this should not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the park at 10 AM at the northwestern parking area off of Rte. 89. Then we will hike in a clockwise direction around the lake. The hike should last about 2.75 hrs. at a leasurly pace and be over by about 12:45 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group has the option of stopping someplace in Mansfield Center or Storrs for lunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader on this one is Kevin S (&lt;a href="http://hiking.meetup.com/151/members/2499916/"&gt;http://hiking.meetup....&lt;/a&gt;) so please direct questions on this event to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pets on a leash are permitted in picnic areas and on hiking trails.
