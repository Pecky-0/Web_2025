Much of the trail meanders through the twisting and curved streets that are the original paths and byways established by the first colonists.  The trail starts in Boston Common, heads through the North End and finishes across the river in Charlestown, and at a total of 3 miles in length, it should only take a couple of hours to complete.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds fun! So all you frustrated tourists out there, join us as we the walk the walk and then go for a couple of drinks at the Tavern on the Water in Charlestown.

And bring some comfortable shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants to meet later for drinks, we should get there around 3-4pm.
