This story of fatal attraction between Carmen, a passionate gypsy, and Don José, a Spanish army corporal betrothed to another woman, is one of the most celebrated works in the operatic canon.  For this production, La Scala chose some of the hottest new talent in the opera world, including Georgian mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili in the title role, German tenor Jonas Kaufmann as Don José, Uruguayan baritone Erwin Schrott as Escamillo, and Italian soprano Adriana Damato as Micaëla.  Tickets are $20/$17. Buy your tickets on line to ensure availability and to avoid lines that morning at www.coolidge.org/opera. Let's meet at 9:40 and go in together as soon as the doors open. Those of us interested can have lunch afterwards. Please indicate if you'd definitely be interested in going to lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At the door until doors open.
