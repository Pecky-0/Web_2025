They would run for 45 min. and would cost $15.00 plus a $1.00 meetup.com charge for each person - total cost of $16.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a certified Total Immersion swim coach and without her help I would have never gotten through my first tri. (I was a total noob to swimming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can do June 21st, June 28th and July 12th at 7:30 AM at Walden pond. (for directions: &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/walden/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/walden/directions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mass.gov/d...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimum of 4 people and a max of 10.  If there's enough interest we'll try to do all 3 dates. I'm going to have to say it's a first come first serve basis, and if the clinics fill up we'll have to somehow regulate that a person can only partake in one clinic so everyone gets their fair share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about Katherine here:&lt;br /&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.munchkinmovement.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.munchkinmovement.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.munchkinmo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bigdreamsfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bigdreamsf...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is well received! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's to happy confident open-water swimming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Rebecca&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My old swim coach from TNT, Katherine Schwab (a certified total immersion swim i</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214854067000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Meet fellow meetup.com tri peeps, get more confident in your swimming and last b</why><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213154487000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Water Swim Clinic - Walden Pond</name><id>8120767</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214652600000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/8120767/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/2/global_1776498.jpeg</photo_url></item>
