Let's try to squeak out one more outdoor event before this cool weather gets the best of us so bring a blanket and join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This month's event will be at a Greenhill Park in Worcester. We'll be meeting in the park so please bring food that doesn't need to be reheated or cooled (unless you bring your own hibachi or cooler). If you want to know what to bring.. or to let me know what you are bringing that would be great. We don't want 10 potato salads!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plan on doing some pro-veg leafletting afterwards as well. If there are enough people at the park we'll do it there.. but we are open to suggestions for another high traffic (on a Sunday) location. We have plenty of pamphlets so you just need to bring your enthusiasm ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can park at 24 McKinley Road - corner of McKinley and Windsor or any surrounding street. We can enter the park right near there. Here is the map: &lt;a href="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y267/xinared535/map.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://i7.photobucket...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case of rain we will go to Christina's new apt at 24 McKinley Road, Apt 1 (first floor). Pretty convenient huh? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carpooling will be available as always, just contact me in advance so it can be coordinated. Also try to RSVP as early as possible for this one so we can prepare for enough people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For help with directions or if you have questions, call Stephen (me) at 508-410-3172 or Christina at 919-523-8909.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Stephen Dunne</member_name><member_id>1339538</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188925625000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-365</urlname><id>225364</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186337233000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Vegan MeetUp &amp; EatUp September Meetup</name><id>6129148</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188752400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-365/events/6129148/</event_url></item>
