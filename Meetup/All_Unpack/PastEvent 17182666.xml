&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000080"&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/2/event_23103346.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empty - Suzanne Weyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #333333"&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : small"&gt;It's the near future - the very near future - and the fossil fuels are running out. No gas. No oil. Which means no driving. No heat. Supermarkets are empty. Malls have shut down. Life has just become more local than we ever knew it could be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : small"&gt;Nobody expected the end to come this fast. And in the small town of Spring Valley, decisions that once seemed easy are quickly becoming matters of life and death. There is hope - there has to be hope - just there are also sacrifices that need to be made, and a whole society that needs to be rethought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : small"&gt;Teens like Niki, Tom, and Gwen may find what they need to survive. But their lives are never going to be the same again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000080 ; font-size : small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hunger Games &amp;ndash; Suzanne Collins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : small"&gt;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.  &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before&amp;mdash;and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that will weigh survival against humanity and life against love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Abdul</member_name><member_id>2464273</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306954682000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1301956502000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>May Discussion: Empty &amp; The Hunger Games</name><id>17182666</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1306881000000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/17182666/</event_url></item>
