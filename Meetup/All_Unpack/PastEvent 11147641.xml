We will use the first hour of the meeting to celebrate the sixth anniversary.  We will eat in the lounge area outside Room 315.  Use the time to network, pick the brains of your fellow traders and introduce yourself to some of  the members you haven't yet met.  Please fill out a name tag and wear it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TITLE: &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open discussion of the economy, the market, investment strategies that are working and other topics BIG members suggest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESCRIPTION:  Many members seem to like the open discussion format.  We will attempt to use this for the bulk of the &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; part of the meeting.  Jeff will lead, facilitate, orchestrate, whatever.  We will have fun taking advantage of the mental horsepower of our members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Market's Horoscope led by Joyce Levine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce will enlighten us as to some of the market's upcoming astrological signposts and what they mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON TIGER PRE-MEETING Announcement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boston Tiger Meeting of the Tiger Financial Network meets starting at 5:30 PM to get more meat into the meetings.
