Shop or hang out and listen to merry music. Feel the past come to life around you.... Spend the day at ye old renaissance faire. This is for people like me who have no plans for Labor Day &amp;amp; love to take that step back in time and head on down to the New York Renaissance Faire. If you are interested but cannot do this date, suggest a new one because it is open on weekends until September 25th. Adult tickets are $22 at the gate, but if you order online, they are $20 @ &lt;a href="http://www.renfair.com/ny/tickets/index.asp" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.renfair.com/ny/tickets/index.asp&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes, they have even cheaper tickets for Labor day so I am waiting to purchase my ticket. It could be a fun-filled day especially if you dress up (I have extra costumes for any of the ladies). The Faire runs from 10am - 7pm. I am willing to drive and can squeeze 7 other people into my truck. Mapquest says it will take about 2 hours to get there but it's totally worth the trip! So I'd leave around 8am from Waterbury area.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call or text Andi at 203 805 8279</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andi</member_name><member_id>14218596</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1315300663000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1313944517000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NY Renaissance Faire</name><id>30313141</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315231200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/30313141/</event_url></item>
