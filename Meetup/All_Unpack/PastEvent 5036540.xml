Everything you need to have fun will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each player will have their choice of a premade character (first come, first choice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person running the game will be Tas who has 10+ years of experience in the D&amp;amp;D game. Don't worry if you've had difficulties learning from others, I'm patient, helpful, and my #1 priority is for new players to enjoy themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couples with non-gaming partners are welcome, but be warned, Tas may be strict with the more-experienced partner. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For experienced players who wish to know, this will be a one-shot game from a Wizard's of the Coast Published adventure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I find out the location of people who wish to play, I will set up a location, which will probably be a game store.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1154732962000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1153572429000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August Beginners' D&amp;D Game</name><id>5036540</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1154559600000</time><rsvp_limit>5</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/5036540/</event_url></item>
