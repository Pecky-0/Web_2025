&lt;p style="text-align : left"&gt;Micki Kuttler, LMT, Professional Bowenwork(R) Practitioner, provides Bowen Therapy to adults and children in the Boston area. Bowen Therapy is a gentle healing modality that was developed by Tom Bowen in Australia in the second half of the 20th century.&amp;nbsp; Bowen Therapy is helpful in resolving a wide range of health concerns, from sports injuries and other musculo-skeletal pains, restrictions and imbalances, to hormonal imbalances, digestive disorders, headaches and migraines, fibromyalgia, and even infertility. &lt;br /&gt;

Micki Kuttler is the founder of Boston Bowen. She is a Licensed Massage Therapist, and a Professional Bowenwork Practitioner certified by the Bowen Therapy Academy of Australia. She has been practicing massage since 1998 and Bowen since 2003 and is currently accepting new clients into her Cambridge-based practice. She enjoys helping people feel better, and loves the way people respond to Bowen work. She believes, as did Tom Bowen, that "Every body is better with Bowen."&lt;/p&gt;
