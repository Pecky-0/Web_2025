It sounded like most everyone hated the last book but hey, that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking into getting our own room for that night. Ideas that were floated were Pandemonium in Central Square and Your Move Games in Davis as they have back rooms and pander to the nerd crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next book, we reached an agreement on a sci-fi classic, Ubik by Phillip K Dick. It should be a much more well received book than Snow Crash while still being a very engaging discussion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Josh&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be  wearing something nerdy and most likely a scaly cap :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Josh</member_name><member_id>9704391</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273755604000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1271297342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SciFi Boston's Book Club Meeting!!</name><id>13187386</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273707000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/13187386/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
