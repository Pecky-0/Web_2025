Join us for a variety of different activities with a variety of different groups. You get two privileges with membership. You can go to our activities, or you can Host your own with us. Our events &amp;amp; activities are run by member volunteers like you, called Asst. Organizers. The Organizers will do their best at these activities to introduce you to as many people as they can. We only asks you to be open to being introduced to others throughout the event. Therefore, if you don't enjoy the event? It will not be, because you didn't know anyone. Most seem to enjoy themselves because they were introduced, and the event or activity was just a nice addition.
