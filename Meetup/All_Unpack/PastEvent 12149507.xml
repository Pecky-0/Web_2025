<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We are hosting a Winter/New Year/Solstice party at our home in Dracut.  It'll be a pot luck affair, like the Darwin Day party was. Have good selection of video and board games. Recently we were gifted a copy of the comedy Jesus video. Also planning some mini-short timed group games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Please contact us directly at prissydarian@yahoo.com or through this site for any questions/suggestions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the time begins close to dinner; I'll have some food.  It would be a great help for us if you can list any food/drink items on here or email me with what you may bring.  All RSVPs will receive directions/phone number/parking instructions prior to sat.  &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;           &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking fwd to some great conversations and spending time with those of you who are able to join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263245769000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261864178000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lindsay's and Darrick's Winter Party *New Date Due to Weather</name><id>12149507</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263072600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/12149507/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/2/global_10991506.jpeg</photo_url></item>
