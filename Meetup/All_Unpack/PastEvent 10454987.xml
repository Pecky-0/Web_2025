We begin up the ridge by way of Falling Waters trail which is loaded with beautiful waterfalls. Our first objective will be Little Haystack mountain. There is a nice area on the summit of Little Haystack to take a snack break. From the summit of Little Haystack we will be above tree line where the 360 degree views will amaze you! From here we continue on to the summit of Lincoln and then on to the summit of Lafayette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the summit of Lafayette we will decend via the Old Bridle Path and we will make a stop at the Greenleaf hut where snacks and soup are usually available. Fresh water is also available here. On our descent we will be treated to amazing views of the ridge from along the Old Bridle Path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals&lt;br /&gt;Distance - 8.90 mi&lt;br /&gt;Time - 9 hr&lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain - 4154 ft&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like this guy -----&gt;</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Milton</member_name><member_id>4294409</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243508588000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242836556000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Franconia Ridge !</name><id>10454987</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243169100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/10454987/</event_url></item>
