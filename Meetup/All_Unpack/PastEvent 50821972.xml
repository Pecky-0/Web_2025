Session will feature 4 models in interactive poses. It will be held on Saturday March 10th from 1-5 at the New Art Center in Newtonville. The first hour will be a warm-up starting with gesture moving into longer poses with the goal of establishing a long pose for the remainder of the session. The remaining three hours will be one long pose unless there is a majority census to break the remaining three hours into two poses. Models will be Andrea &amp;amp; Ed, Julia &amp;amp; Dennis. &amp;nbsp;This session will be held in the gallery and can comfortably fit 25 artists. With a model stand as well as track lighting, it will be a very pleasant room for working. Accepted medium - dry and watercolor. Sorry but no oil paints. Some easels are available but if you have a portable easel, I would encourage you to bring it. Fee: $25 for 4 hours &amp;amp; 4 models. Please sign up here if you intend to go.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ed</member_name><member_id>7904010</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1331695559000</updated><rating><average>4.69999980927</average><count>10</count></rating><group><who>Art Models and Artists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NE-artists-models-group</urlname><id>408475</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>New England Artists/Models Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1328233252000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>4 Models, 4 Hours - March 10th, 1-5pm, Newtonville, $25</name><id>50821972</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1331402400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NE-artists-models-group/events/50821972/</event_url></item>
