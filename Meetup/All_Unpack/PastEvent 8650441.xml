We'll have screenings every Tuesday somewhere in the Merrimack Valley: &lt;b&gt;1st Tuesday-Nashua&lt;/b&gt;; 2nd Tuesday-Manchester; 3rd Tuesday-Concord; 4th Tuesday-Plymouth. If there's a 5th Tuesday in a month, maybe we'll have a Truth Party somewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This month in Nashua we will see &lt;a href="http://www.infowars.com/?p=2986" target="_blank"&gt;Truth Rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, by Alex Jones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;9/11 Chronicles: Part One, Truth Rising&lt;/b&gt; is a testament to free speech, an endangered commodity in post September 11, 2001 America. Alex Jones’ latest documentary is a vivid testament standing in complete and defiant opposition to former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer’s admonishment that “nowadays you have to be careful what you say and do,” as if the orchestrated events of that horrible day have nullified the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. In Jones’ latest documentary, filmed in cinéma-vérité style — an appropriate technique, as the phrase translates from the French as “cinema of truth” — we witness repeated instances of police insisting the First Amendment is a dead letter and citizens no longer have the right to speak their minds in public, especially citizens going up against the imposed political orthodoxy and Fleischer’s counsel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Truth Rising also reveals that it is not only New York City’s&lt;/b&gt; militarized police who believe the First Amendment is moribund, but many citizens do as well. “You ain’t American,” insists one such fine specimen at Ground Zero, angry over the possibility that somebody would actually dare contest the official version of events and ask questions and demand answers. Others fling mindless and obscene epithets and swipe at the camera, as if incapable of tolerating, let alone understanding and respecting the First Amendment, an absolute freedom that occupies a preferred position in the pantheon of our liberties. In post-9/11 America, the exercise of free speech is relegated to government mandated “free speech zones” and to insist the whole of the country is a free speech zone casts one in dark suspicion along with the likes Osama and the manufactured enemies of America. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll also go over how each attender can become more involved&lt;/b&gt; and spread the workload of running a meetup like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll have free DVD's&lt;/b&gt; and DVD's and books for sale. Everyone should bring their collection for trading, viewing, copying, etc. Bring your favorite books, too. We've developed a collection of books for sale at these various meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please arrive at 7:00 PM&lt;/b&gt;, since this meeting is on a tight schedule. We'll start a brief business meeting at 7 and the video will begin promptly at 7:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is in the lot in front of the building. Please enter the right entry doorway and suite 135 will be directly ahead of you. After entering the office, turn left to go to the video viewing room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Merrimack Valley 911 Truth has set up a &amp;quot;carpooling group&amp;quot; online&lt;/b&gt; at &lt;a href="http://mv911t.eRideShare.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://mv911t.eRideSh...&lt;/a&gt;. Our group nickname is &amp;quot;mv911t&amp;quot; and our password is &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;. You can post if you are driving to one of our events and have extra seats - if you're looking for a ride to an event just logon and post that you're seeking a ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, &lt;b&gt;donations to the driver for the ride-sharing are appreciated&lt;/b&gt; to cover gas costs.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy fiddling with the A/V equipment :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jaqeboy</member_name><member_id>3996281</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220569567000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Concerned Citizens</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>9-11-307</urlname><id>464907</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>Merrimack Valley 9/11 Questions Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220061435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Nashua - Truth Rising</name><id>8650441</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220396400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/9-11-307/events/8650441/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/e/d/global_5333357.jpeg</photo_url></item>
