&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;~ Learn in a Safe, Supportive, non-Judgmental Atmosphere&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;Classes currently scheduled for Sun, 9/18 &amp;amp; Sun, 9/25&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Tuition: $50 &lt;br /&gt;

-The primary focus&lt;/strong&gt; of these skills sessions will be to learn and practice the simple techniques necessary to safely&amp;nbsp;get back into your kayak if you capsize.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;-You'll also learn how&lt;/strong&gt; to assist a fellow paddler if s/he winds up in the water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-You'll begin to understand&lt;/strong&gt; and appreciate the capabilities of your boat.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Q. How far can I lean over before I fall in? A. Surprisingly far!) &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;-You'll learn how&lt;/strong&gt; to paddle faster and farther with less effort. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

-And we'll discuss&lt;/strong&gt; many other topics including tides, current, navigation, gear, hypothermia, and general boating safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : large"&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/3/c/event_52324412.jpeg" width="304" height="236" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Kayaking is a great sport in part because it doesn't take a tremendous amount of skill to begin. Almost anyone can jump in and paddle, drifting through the water, enjoying the scenery, and return feeling invigorated and refreshed. But even in the summer, the waters in New England can be cold. And often there are currents and wind and power boat traffic to deal with, making even a short stay outside of your boat quite dangerous. (And simply swimming to shore is often not possible or advisable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you paddle a kayak&lt;/strong&gt;, you need to know what to do if you or a friend falls into the water (and how to prevent it!). It's generally not possible to climb back into one while you're floating in your PFD (life jacket). The boat will roll over and over until you exhaust yourself. But there are a few simple techniques that make it possible to get back in and continue safely on your way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And here's the thing:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; When you understand how your boat, your body, and the water all interact, you'll gain confidence in your abilities and in yourself! And you'll be a more valuable paddling partner as well. There's nothing like knowing what you're doing to make you feel empowered and enhance your self-esteem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Comments on previous skills classes: &lt;br /&gt;

Judy P:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is a must-take course for any skill level. No one plans on going in the water. Knowing your boat, gear, and re-entry skills make it no big deal should you find yourself in the water. Larry's well prepared and professionally delivered class will teach you the skills you need. He covers what to be aware of to avoid falling in in the first place. His class offers the same supportive environment for learning these skills as he does in his paddling meetups. His goal is that each attendee is successful at getting back into their boat. I am a recreational kayaker and a novice at that, having only paddled 6 times. I am typically in rented or borrowed gear. I'd not given much thought to safety skills. After taking this course, I am confident that I can get back into any kayak since I know what works and what doesn't work! I also am wiser about features I will look for when purchasing a kayak and safety gear. So don't miss out...take this course while the water temps are still warm.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Deb W:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This was a great class! Lorenzo was well prepared, with handouts even, and the information was right on target. The on-water instruction was clear, so I felt comfortable attempting the new skills. Well, as comfortable as one can be when preparing to bail out of a perfectly good kayak anyway! Working with Lorenzo and Judy was fun and safe. The camaraderie was great. Working in the warm waters of a local lake also made it easy to focus on the skills rather than the elements. I would encourage everyone to learn these skills. You never know when you may need them, and they are not as easy as you might think. We also discovered that there can be significant differences from one kayak to another, so knowing what works for your equipment is important.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been paddling for over 12 years&lt;/strong&gt; and have led kayak trips for the past three years. In addition to these skills classes, most recently I co-led an AMC kayaking skills weekend in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This workshop will be geared&lt;/strong&gt; toward paddlers from &lt;span style="text-decoration : underline"&gt;beginner to intermediate&lt;/span&gt;. And we'll keep the group very small to facilitate one-on-one instruction. These workshops have been a tremendous success, and everyone walks away feeling it was time and money very well spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During this full-day class&lt;/strong&gt;, we'll practice falling out of our boats (wet exits) and getting back into them again; both alone (self rescue) &amp;amp; with help from a partner (assisted rescue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I understand&lt;/strong&gt; that many people have a certain amount of anxiety about purposely capsizing their kayaks, or in their physical ability to climb back in. This will be a safe, supportive, and judgment-free opportunity to learn these necessary skills. Knowing them could mean the difference between a minor inconvenience and a potentially life-threatening emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This course will&lt;/strong&gt; go a long way toward helping you to paddle more safely. In the process, you'll gain confidence in your boat and in yourself, and that will enable you to enjoy kayaking much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether you sign up&lt;/strong&gt; for this workshop or spend more for one with a commercial outfitter, I highly recommend that EVERYONE who kayaks take at least one basic skills class. Even if you've been paddling for years, if you have not practiced self and assisted rescues, you risk hypothermia and drowning if you cannot get back into your boat once you've fallen into the water.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
