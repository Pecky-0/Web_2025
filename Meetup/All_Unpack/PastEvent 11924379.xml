(Rt. 1) in Orange, CT, their phone: (203) 298-0742.  It's only been a few weeks, but we're looking forward to returning to the Bear &amp;amp; Grill, a fine eatery and watering hole on the Post Road...featuring a rustic Adirondack hunting lodge decor, along with hearty, stick to your ribs, grill dishes!  We've always had a lot of fun at our shows here...fun, casual party vibe here!!!  Showtime starts at 9:30, if any of our past shows are any indication, reservations maybe in order as we usually pack this room too!!!
