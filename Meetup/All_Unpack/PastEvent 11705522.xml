<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>A 4 hr. loop hike of lower to moderate difficulty near the south-central shore area in this 448 acre sanctuary with 20 miles of trails that are similar to Westwoods in terrain. Stoney Creek is just west of Westwoods and is connected by a .5 mile trail to the Westwoods trail system. &lt;b&gt;We are going to explore the Preserve as I haven't seen it yet so this is an exploratory hike I'm very excited about.&lt;/b&gt; We may encounter and involve traversal of modest cliffs, going through rockfall caves, small climbs, and seeing interesting rock formations, a waterfall, and other sights! I'll be exploring for hike routes to offer into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trails have a unique blaze system like Westwoods (&lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org/reading_trailblazes.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.westwoodst...&lt;/a&gt; ). North-south trails are marked with a circle shaped blaze. Square or triangular trails weave back and forth connecting circle trails. Crossover trails that connect two circle trails of different colors are marked with an X of the color of the circle they lead to. Complicated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a good chance of some mud on the trail given the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who wish to go should have: &lt;br /&gt;* A daypack - To carry extra layers of clothing as well as trail food and water. &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots (sneakers not advised!) &lt;br /&gt;* 1 quart of water&lt;br /&gt;* Pants you don't mind possibly getting dirty from crawling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetup will be at 8 AM at the parking area (&lt;b&gt;this one is a new location!&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;Parking may be limited so RSVP's are limited.&lt;/b&gt; We would finish up at about Noon and could have a quick picnic lunch (or QUICK lunch out) if the group feels like socializing more before the next hike at 1 PM at Westwoods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;General directions&lt;/b&gt; (from a trail source):&lt;br /&gt;* Take Exit 57 off I-95&lt;br /&gt;* Take Route 1 south for about 2 miles.&lt;br /&gt;* Turn left onto Moose Hill Rd. for about 1 mile.&lt;br /&gt;* Turn right onto Granite Rd. and follow to the end for parking and trail entrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aproximate location/directions&lt;/b&gt; (end of 599 Granite Rd., Guilford, CT):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Guilford&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=599+Granite+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trail map available&lt;/b&gt; in &amp;quot;Connecticut Walk Book: East&amp;quot; 19th ed., Map SC-1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guilford Land Trust&lt;/b&gt; (maintains Stoney Creek):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guilfordlandtrust.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.guilfordla...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;=== Legal Stuff ===&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
