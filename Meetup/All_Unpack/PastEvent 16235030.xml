I find working with others to be inspiring and a way to broaden my horizons.  We could meet in cafes to exchange ideas and then form a design team.  There are always international competitions to choose from and working on a team would help with discipline and lower the entry fee per participant.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362192127000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Design Build Professionals</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonarchitects</urlname><id>696342</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Architecture Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276467788000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>How about a design charette?</name><id>16235030</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1362180600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonarchitects/events/16235030/</event_url></item>
