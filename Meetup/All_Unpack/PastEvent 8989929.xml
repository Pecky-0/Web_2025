Join us there in November.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the Gardner, we’re just wild about Dante – visionary and poet of the many themes of love, passion, faith, and the folly of man. It was the rare books penned by Dante that first inspired Isabella to start collecting art. Explore themes of love in the special exhibition The Triumph of Marriage and see how a contemporary artist interprets Dante in a special After Hours PLUS program.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Courtyard Sounds: Soak in the sounds of experimental violinist Emil Altschuler (5:30 to 8:30PM)&lt;br /&gt;    * Gallery Travels: Isabella Gardner collected early Dante manuscripts early on in her collection and regularly attended Dante lectures at Harvard by her friend and Dante Scholar Charles Elliot Norton. Discover these rare manuscripts in the Long Gallery and other collection highlights that speak to her interest in books and learning.&lt;br /&gt;    * Viewfinder: Explore the art of marriage with Viewfinder talks throughout the evening in the Triumph of Marriage special exhibition gallery. And listen in on ongoing discussions about John S. Sargent’s famous portrait of Isabella Gardner (5:30 to 8:30PM)&lt;br /&gt;    * Sketching in the Galleries: Create your own masterpieces with drawing in the cloisters and galleries (6 to 9PM)&lt;br /&gt;    * Artful Flavors: Indulge in the culinary arts, signature cocktails including the all-new Madame Gautreau, and more at the courtside bar and Gardner Café.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a purple flower pin.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cristin</member_name><member_id>603739</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227393199000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Fine Art Appreciators</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonVisualArtAppreciators</urlname><id>1280431</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Visual Fine Art Appreciators</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1224434279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gardner After Hours--November!</name><id>8989929</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227220200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonVisualArtAppreciators/events/8989929/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/7/global_5570647.jpeg</photo_url></item>
