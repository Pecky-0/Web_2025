&lt;p&gt;This is our Annual Trading Deadline Round Table Event. The trading deadline&amp;nbsp;will have passed on July 31&amp;nbsp;and we will be sorting out all of the moves made and&amp;nbsp;not made by the Red Sox and the competition.&amp;nbsp;Three years ago the event was quite lively as we celebrated the departure of Manny and the arrival of Jason Bay with a shot of Johnny Walker Red!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natives Team Weatherman Scott says it will probably be a hazy, hot and humid night so we will venture outside to watch the Sox game at Legal Seafoods out door bar and patio at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square. This is the raw bar at street level visible from the street, not the patio dining area in the courtyard. There are several Televisions at the bar. The bar menu is sufficient for most people. The Red Sox play the&amp;nbsp;Indians at Fenway at 7:10pm and we will watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be either at or around the bar and then move to a round table. Ask the bartenders if you can not find us or are a newbie. All members should wear Red Sox Baseball hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance at this is unlimited. Please RSVP and bring guests and other Sox fans. Come meet other members who share your interest, provide feedback on desired events and cheer on our Sox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to maintain your own tab or pay cash for your beverage and food and tip your server/bartender when paying your separate food and drink check before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Sox&lt;/p&gt;
