We attempted to see this back on March 20th, didn't realize it would be so popular and when we arrived we found out it was a sellout show.  There have been 2 other shows since that attempt that have also sold out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to attend this event it is highly suggested you call and get your tickets soon.  THIS SHOW WILL BE SOLD OUT AND WILL SELL OUT QUICKLY.  Please add to your RSVP that you have purchased your ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOUBLE HEADER&lt;br /&gt;Bout #1, 5 pm: Boston Massacre vs. Oly Rollers (Olympia, WA)&lt;br /&gt;Bout #2, 7 pm: Cosmonaughties vs. Wicked Pissahs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After party in the Fez Room with DJ John Barera&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors at 4 pm, Bout #1 at 5 pm, Bout #2 at 7 pm&lt;br /&gt;Shriners Auditorium, Wilmington, MA&lt;br /&gt;Tickets $16 online, there is also a $2.00 processing fee which will bring the tickets to $18.00  (good for both bouts of the double header)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bout #1: The Wicked Pissahs vs. The Cosmonaughties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bout #2: The Boston Massacre faces their toughest opponent yet in the 2010 WFTDA Champion Cosa Nostra Donnas from Olympia, WA. The Oly Rollers were the Cinderella Story of 2009, entering tournament play in January and finishing out the year with a defeat of Texas in the final game at Nationals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go to the Shriners site and reserve your ticket and we'll meet you at the Rollerderby.&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274482027000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>A-Circle-of-Friends</urlname><id>1421257</id><group_lat>42.8100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8799972534</group_lon><name>A Circle of Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272234218000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Double bout Roller Derby at Shriners Auditorium</name><id>13287440</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273953600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/A-Circle-of-Friends/events/13287440/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/f/global_14624767.jpeg</photo_url></item>
