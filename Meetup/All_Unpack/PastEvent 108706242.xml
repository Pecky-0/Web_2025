&lt;p&gt;It is time for all liberty-loving Americans to realize that our Republic is in great jeopardy. The recent attacks on our 2nd Amendment will eventually turn into gun confiscation if we don't make a stand. Furthermore, we are witnessing the erosion of many of our Constitutional Rights by politicians who have no regard for their Oath of Office. That is why we have named this rally "Honor Your Oath."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

It is up to "We the People" to make it clear to those who would violate their oath that we want them to step down or to be forcibly removed from office. Time is running out. We need a massive turnout to send a clear message that the Sleeping Giant has awakened and we are coming. Remember: "All it takes for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing." It's time to join the fight. Will you be there? &lt;br /&gt;
