<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Linda and Ralph will host us for their traditional &amp;quot;Souper Supper.&amp;quot;  They will have the crockpots of soup simmering.  You could bring something to round out the meal ... appetizer, bread, salad, beverage, or dessert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dinner, we'll have our usual raucous meeting, believe me, they are not all business!  But amidst the laughter, we will plan our events for April and May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is in a private home in Middletown, you must RSVP to get directions.  When you RSVP, please tell us what you will be bringing for food or drink to share.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda</member_name><member_id>3403216</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268006614000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264384910000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"Souper Supper" Potluck</name><id>12412461</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267833600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/12412461/</event_url></item>
