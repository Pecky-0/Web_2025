&lt;p&gt;Our hike will cover some familiar trails in a not so familiar combination with a few options according to group interest.  For any four-legged hikers, Buffett has included a number of ponds for cooling off.  On our last hiking of this route we had to watch our step to avoid tiny toads, lady slippers, and, of course, horse poop!  Instead of the bird's-foot and lance-leaved violets we saw on eastern forest trails a few weeks ago, we saw starflowers, water lilies, ferns and indigo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of ticks, so bug spray as well as water and snacks for two- and four-legged hikers is recommended as well as sturdy foot gear and long pants if some overgrown trails would bother you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please allow 2-3 hours for hiking to allow for heat, rests, and ability levels as well as time to check out the old CCC camp if anyone is interested.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura Troll</member_name><member_id>11017991</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1339031281000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1338214703000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>June First Sunday Hike</name><id>66636642</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1338741000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/66636642/</event_url></item>
