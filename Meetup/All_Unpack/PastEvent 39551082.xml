If you like, come early and have something to eat or just sit and talk. The DJ that doesn't mind taking requests so bring your dancing shoes! The DJ starts playing at 9:00 and runs until 1:00. There may be people from two other groups joining us as well. I will let the host/hostess know where the group is sitting so if your new, just ask for the Meetup group and they will make sure you get to the right table! Hope to see you there :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda S 927</member_name><member_id>12607600</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1321211462000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>fun folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dance-342</urlname><id>462174</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>Dance &amp; Activities Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1320181784000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ashworth by the Sea - Dinner/Dancing</name><id>39551082</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1321144200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dance-342/events/39551082/</event_url></item>
