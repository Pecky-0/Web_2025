(formerly the Playwright). Come on and dance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you're only a &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot;, please put a comment in your RSVP.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 9pm, hang-out, and at some point get dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dance room is supposed to open at 9. If you're definitely coming and aren't too shy to &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; a dance floor, I'm happy to meet earlier (8pm?), and get dancing sooner. Let me know, I'll change the start time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a $10 cover. Or for $15 you get 1 drink + free BAR pizza until 10pm (a special they're having that night). Or buy ticket in advance (203-288-CAMP) for $10 and get the free drink and pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music at Wicked Wolf is usually like what you'd hear on 101.3FM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DINNER BEFORE?&lt;/b&gt; I probably can't, but I MAY end up downtown earlier to eat anyway. If you want to join, email me your cell and I'll text you if that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO FIND US:&lt;/b&gt; We may hang-out in front first. Regardless, just text me (203-901-4957) when you're close to the venue to give some time for me to notice your text.  If it helps, I'm tall (6'3&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOST:&lt;/b&gt; Jason, cell # in my RSVP (noisy club, texting probably best)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARKING:&lt;/b&gt; I always find free street parking easily northeast of the green...Temple St, Grove St, etc. Or look at New Haven's parking garage map &lt;a href="http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/ParkingAuthority/images/map.gif" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Text me when you're close to arriving.
