For those of you who don't know who Bruce Campbell is or haven't seen &lt;i&gt;Army of Darkness&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Bubba Ho-Tep&lt;/i&gt;, I am very, very sorry for you.  That being said, the new movie looks great, you can view the trailer &lt;a href="http://www.mynameisbruce.net/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of the promotion for the new film, Bruce will be at Criterion Cinemas to talk about the movie  and have a Q&amp;amp;A period with the audience after.  There are two showings on Wed. at which he will be available for questions, 7:30pm and 10pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've already purchased my tickets for the 7:30 show online and would suggest doing the same for anyone interested in attending.  I don't know if it'll sell out, but its better to be prepared.  I'll be at theater prior to 7:30, will update an exact time in my RSVP next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just remember...Good, Bad, I'm the guy with the gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact: Jeanie - 860-942-4708&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>2254163</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227307288000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226115568000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wed. - Meet Bruce Campbell!!!!</name><id>9118480</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226536200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/9118480/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/0/global_6230176.jpeg</photo_url></item>
