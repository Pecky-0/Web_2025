Inside the Alewife station there are signs to the Russell Field exit.  You will then walk outside onto a bike path.  Russell Field is directly on the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleats are ALLOWED on Russell Field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the game plan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * 8:00 - Toss the disc around, meet folks, be merry&lt;br /&gt;    * 8:15 - Overview of the rules, safety, etc - then divide into teams&lt;br /&gt;    * 8:30 - Play!!!!!! biggrin&lt;br /&gt;    * 10:00 - Conclude the meetup with snacks and socializing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what we humbly ask of you (works great as a checklist):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Bring a white t-shirt and a colored t-shirt&lt;br /&gt;    * Arrive on time to be guaranteed a spot in a game (RSVP is optional - but helpful for others who want to know if people they played with in a previous game are going to be there smile)&lt;br /&gt;    * Bring WATER!&lt;br /&gt;    * If you are a regular, please consider bringing a buck for the Frisbee Fund&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, we will supply the frisbees, cones, lanyards, first aid supplies (hopefully will never be used) and our pretty smiles. As we periodically mention, all these supplies are paid out-of-pocket by your loving Frisbee organizers and everyone has been so generous with their donations to-date. Thank you and let's keep the dream alive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan + Robb&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>461418</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>robb</member_name><member_id>11053577</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291306939000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290920240000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wednesday Night Time Ultimate @ Russell Field</name><id>15571611</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291251600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/15571611/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/0/global_15355168.jpeg</photo_url></item>
