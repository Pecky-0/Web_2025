<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;nitially the idea was received with skepticism but finally persistence paid off and we picked Karen’s theme. &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;his one is a bit tricky logistically. &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;o pay close attention! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;t our April dinner, those in attendance drew slips of paper from a hat. &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;he slips of paper had the initials of another person at the dinner on it. &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;ow the charge is to cook a dish inspired by the one or more of the initials on the paper drawn. &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;he more of the initials on your slip of paper you can incorporate into your offering the more points you get. &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;f you are one of the folk with already drawn initials please put them in the notes of your RSVP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;f you were not at our April dinner, or if you left early we will need to do a virtual drawing. &lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt;hen the May dinner fills up, I will collect the undrawn initials and randomly assign them to others. &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;his means I will be sending you a request for your initials that I really need you to respond to immediately. &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;hen I will let you know what your assigned initials are for your food challenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;f you are not yet thoroughly confused, I am sure I can work on it a bit more until I achieve full confusion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to RSVP early as we always fill up quickly. Do RSVP though, especially if it gets you on the waiting list. Usually the waiting list people get to join us for dinner.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to cook on site, unless your recipe takes 45 minutes or more to prepare start to finish. Because the oven opens and closes often baked goods (excepting cookies) are best done ahead of time. Remember this isn’t just a potluck; this is about sharing the pleasure of cooking and food, and learning from one another while drinking wine 'n stuff and having great conversations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring what you'd like to drink plus a little to share.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will send the address a few days before the event</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jennifer</member_name><member_id>3917688</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gady</member_name><member_id>8983958</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278867663000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268888136000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Hartford Cooking And Recipes Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>lvvfnynhbsb</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273878000000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/12920451/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/8/2/global_14242994.jpeg</photo_url></item>
