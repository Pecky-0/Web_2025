Had enough of New Haven pizza places?  Think they're all alike?   Au contraire, my dear friends.  Kitchen zinc is a yummy alternative restaurant - at once a cozy bistro with gourmet ingredients, and at the same time a great place to just chill with friends and eat some serious comfort food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drink specials are $3 Draft beer (BBC Goldspike, Ten Penny, Long Trail, and Captain Lawrence) and $5 glasses of wine all evening long.  (all prices are are +tax)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to the NY Times review: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/nyregion/03dinect.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nytimes.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;In order to give the proprietors an accurate estimate of how many people to expect (so that they can provide enough bartenders, etc.), if you think you're going to go then please RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to A.J. for setting up this happy hour, and for serving as our contact for the night.
