Stars Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, and Chris Tucker. Directed by David O. Russell (Three Kings, The Fighter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary (from IMDb): After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, (Jennifer Lawrence) a mysterious girl with problems of her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people have pointed out that this film is only playing at the AMC 16 in Framingham. I wanted to go to Blackstone, but Framingham is the only option. Since 19 have signed up, let's meet at 7:00 for the 7:45 PM show. Feel free to call or text my cell phone at 508-981-0455 if you need to reach me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to can join me for food and drinks afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet outside the theater.
