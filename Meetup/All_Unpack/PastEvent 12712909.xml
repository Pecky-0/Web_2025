Like Hockey?  Like bars?  Like not staying in on a Friday night..?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered Yes to any of these ... Then come out Friday night to McFadden's in Providence to cheer on the Canadian Men's Hockey Team as they take on Slovakia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The puck drops at 9:30pm sharp.  Be there before 10pm if you hate paying cover (The Doc hates cover...).  You'll find the Doc and fellow hockey fans near the back, lounging on the couches watching the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when the last buzzer blows ... maybe we'll skate to another bar close by to mix things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Hockey sticks are optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doc LateNite</member_name><member_id>9585499</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267562912000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267154158000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Olympic Mania as the Canadian Hockey Team Continues its Dominance</name><id>12712909</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267236000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/12712909/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/6/global_13324918.jpeg</photo_url></item>
