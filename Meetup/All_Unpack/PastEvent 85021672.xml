Some of u had the pleasure of meeting and hearing their fabulous vocals at the Sea Dog in Woburn last month. She is a cross between Bonnie Rait and Melissa Etheridge and he is a cross between Jimmy Buffet slash James Taylor. I can only limit the group to 15 for this round, Unfortunately no big back room for us. The music starts at 900pm. WE will have everyone get in and situated for 830. The food is quite yummy and there is of course a full bar at your disposal..........The place has its own parking and there is also plenty of street parking all along Main street.&lt;img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/8/b/2/event_165066322.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : left"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will be in a reserved section right off the bar area.
