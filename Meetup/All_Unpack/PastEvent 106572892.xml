All! My friend's band is playing at "Killarney's" in Nashua this coming Sat. The band starts at 9:00PM so I thought if people wanted to meet there for 7:00PM to get seats and have something to eat that would be fun! I know there are a lot of fun members out there who love to dance so why not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any bar there may be a cover charge after 9PM. They play a lot of Bonnie Raitt and songs from the 60's, 70's and 80's. Look them up on Facebook to find out more. I went to a event back in December and the dance floor was hopping!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Taber</member_name><member_id>10832163</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1362374208000</updated><rating><average>3.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley</urlname><id>1116818</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Meeting &amp; Greeting in So.
