Those of you who attended meetups regularly in the past will remember Steve, a Boston BookCrossing Meetup member for a long while.  Steve moved to Texas a while back, but he will be in town this week!  So, I'm scheduling a supplemental meetup so that we can all hang out with Steve.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However!! Newcomers are *always* welcome.  If you love reading books, talking about books, buying books, giving books away, and/or hoarding books..... then clearly, you belong with us.  Please come to this supplemental meetup even if you don't know Steve.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the agenda: book-related socializing, literary theorizing, publishing gossip, bookstore comparisons, book sharing.... in other words, the usual :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone please notice: In keeping with the nostalgic feel of this particular supplemental meetup, I have located it at Cafe Bella Vita on Charles Street, not at our usual location.  A nice change of scenery for this mid-month meet.  (The Boston  BookCrossers met at Cafe Bella Vita way way back in the olden days.)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liz</member_name><member_id>220016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1203811689000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203288109000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BookCrossing Meetup: Supplemental</name><id>7351047</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1203638400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/7351047/</event_url></item>
