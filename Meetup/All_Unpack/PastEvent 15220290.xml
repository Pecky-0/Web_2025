Doors open at 7:00 p.m., but &lt;b&gt;get there early . . . even before 6:45 p.m.&lt;/b&gt; Seating is first-come, first-served for the main lecture room. The overflow crowd sits in a separate screening room. Admission is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If weather permits, rooftop stargazing through telescopes will follow the presentation. Dress for stargazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free parking is available to everyone after 5 p.m. (Ignore the &amp;quot;staff only&amp;quot; signs.) Drive up to the back, up the hill. The presentation is up the stairs that are opposite the observatory-in-a-box. Mass Ave buses (to points in Arlington and North Cambridge) originate in Harvard Square on the Red Line and travel along Massachusetts Avenue, which is about a 10-minute walk from the auditorium. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information and directions, go to &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/public_events.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/events/public_events.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cfa.harvar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or call 617.495.7461.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A line forms early for this event. Please do not cut in line because we will meet inside the auditorium: go to the back left of the seats. The overflow crowd goes into a separate screening room, so everyone gets in to see the presentation. Even if we don't sit together, we will meet in the courtyard after the lecture and before we go up on the roof. At this point, we can collect everyone from the lecture hall and the overflow viewing room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting at the left rear of the lecture hall is a way to let people find me and an empty seat that much more easily. The lectures are lots of fun, though, and I can certainly understand if you would like to sit up front and closer to the (very entertaining!) talks. Please sit where you are most comfortable. If you are bringing children to the event, you may want to sit toward the front so they can see and ask questions. We will be able to chat after the lecture, while we wait in line for a chance to stargaze through the several rooftop telescopes. Each telescope is usually trained on a different sight in the nighttime sky, so waiting in several lines gives us plenty of time to introduce ourselves. And plenty of exciting objects to observe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the CfA:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monthly Observatory Night&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, November 18, 2010 &amp;quot;Our Cosmic Relatives: The Oldest Stars in the Universe,&amp;quot; Anna Frebel, CfA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are stars in our own Milky Way galaxy that are almost as old as the Universe itself, which is nearly 14 billion years. Anna Frebel will present some of those stellar fossils, and show what we can learn from studying them. This includes the origin and evolution of the chemical elements from which we humans and the world around us are made. With the telescope on the roof, we can look at some of these ancient stars, because they are still shining strong even today.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a Meetup sign. I usually  find a seat at the left rear of the lecture hall; look for me there. After the lecture, meet in the courtyard bet. lecture hall and observatory building, or in one of the telescope lines on the rooftop.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marianne</member_name><member_id>9387943</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>30</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1290479738000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288016491000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Harvard-Smithsonian Observatory: Lecture and Stargazing Open to the Public</name><id>15220290</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1290123900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/15220290/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/1/global_17076769.jpeg</photo_url></item>
