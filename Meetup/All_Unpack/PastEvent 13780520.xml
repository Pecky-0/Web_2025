We will meet in the lobby.  The building has revolving doors and you really can't miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just googlemaps it and you can't miss it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions or concerns please call me or email me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really need to rehearse as a whole group and build our chemistry and further our skills.  As the A-Team you guys have to bring your A-game to rehearsal so we can bring our A-game to our audiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs to be on the same page in terms of growth.  We need to practice practice practice in order to maintain our group energy and to have stronger performances.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week we will work on how to start a scene and maintaining character and energy.  We will also  focus on overall scene structure in terms of finding the game, the conflict, heightening, and finding a ending to a scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason J.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277005440000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276366831000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ensemble A Rehearsal</name><id>13780520</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276459200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/13780520/</event_url></item>
