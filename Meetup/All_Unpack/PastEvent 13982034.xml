During her talk, Mei will share how Buddhist wisdom has influenced her outlook and life and has helped her overcome setbacks during the early part of her American journey and beyond.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a strong determination to expand her horizons and in search of the meaning of life, Mei Hung came to America many years ago to further her education.  She first studied English and worked her way step-by-step through Bunker Hill Community College, then earned her Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Bentley University, then finally at Tufts University earned a Master's Degree in Education and Psychology.  Under her leadership at CCC, she develops and delivers new Chinese Culture programs. She also teaches Tai Chi at Boston University and plays the guqin (an ancient Chinese music instrument).  Through these practices, she intentionally cultivates serenity, balance, health, and wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope that you, friends, and family will join us this Friday night at 6:30 for meditation followed by our Chinese, vegan buffet at 7:00 pm and the presentation at 7:45 pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost (Include dinner) &lt;br /&gt;Adult: $10 Student: $5 (student ID required)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CASH ONLY.
