Main St. across from Mills Tavern&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so its been suggested a few times and this week we're going to Olives!!!! Although some of us were here a lot in '09 for Salsa on Tuesday night, we haven't had an official Monday Night here and its time. Olives has a huge open bar space and a large dining area, although usually most of the tables are whisked away so the space can be opened up for the dance floor. In fact, I have never seen all the tables in it, so I wonder if its really true.........They are also known for their inventive Martini List, but have a decent beer selection as well. Anyway, even though we're going on a Monday night, (I understand it gets a little wild on the weekends), if you haven't been yet, or you have, come on down, hang out and let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a silver scarf, but we're hard to miss!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
