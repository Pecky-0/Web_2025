A wonderful way to spend an afternoon!&lt;br /&gt;  There is a park entrance fee (state park pass does not allow admittance)  and a $4.00 charge per boat!! It costs to paddle here..but its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;   We'll meet up at the boat launch at 11:00!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;   From the end of rt.8 north in Winsted, turn right onto rt.44 east. Drive 3.1 miles and turn left onto rt.318. Stay on rt. 318 for 3.0 miles(follow road signs carefully, as there are a few turns). After crossing over Saville Dam take the 1st right , then another almost immediate right onto rt.219. After turning onto rt. 219, drive 0.4 miles and turn right into Lake McDonough Recreation Area.Watch for boat launch signs. After passing the gatehouse, you will turn left toward the boat house where you will park and launch! &lt;br /&gt;  As always check with mapquest if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>River and Shore Kayak-r's of CT</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>HCR-SK</urlname><id>238228</id><group_lat>41.7000007629</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>~~~~HARTFORD COUNTY RIVERS &amp; CT SHORE KAYAK GROUP~~~~ HCR-SK</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1155840523000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name> Lake McDonough, Barkhamsted Ct.</name><id>5082959</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1155999600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/HCR-SK/events/5082959/</event_url></item>
