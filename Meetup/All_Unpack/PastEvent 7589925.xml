<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We'll be meeting at 8PM at the Cambridge Common baseball diamond which is located a couple blocks north of Harvard Square. We generally play until around 10PM depending on the weather, and then go out for food and drinks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before attending our events, please review our &lt;a href="http://fitness.meetup.com/350/about/"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recommend you bring a light-colored shirt for visibility's sake and a change of clothes. We supply all of the equipment necessary so there's really nothing else you need to bring besides your smiling face. &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/biggrin.gif' border='0' alt='biggrin' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Organizers pay out of pocket for the frisbees, frisbee batteries, lighted lanyards, glowsticks, field cones and first aid kits. Consider bringing a couple bucks or visiting our &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/IRMLHWE8OGKZ"&gt;Amazon Wishlist&lt;/a&gt; to support our equipment costs. Our group is free and will always be that way but your non-obligatory donations are certainly appreciated! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=10+garden+st+cambridge+ma&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=33.626896,81.738281&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.376807,-71.119566&amp;amp;spn=0.007656,0.019956&amp;amp;z=16"&gt;Cambridge Common's Map&lt;/a&gt;.  Parking at Cambridge Common's is tricky and we highly recommend you take the &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; to Harvard Square.  If you have any questions about our group, don't hesitate to contact our Organizers! See you on the field!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, since it's lighter later, we start now at 8 pm, rather than 7 as we have in the past. If you show up at 7, you will be lonely and when we get there we will make fun of you. Not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See  you there!&lt;br /&gt;-Jim O.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be tossing around glowing discs somewhere near the middle of the field.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jim O'Neill</member_name><member_id>4585507</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelli</member_name><member_id>4908325</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207612171000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Because you loooooove frisbee, and playing it in the dark with glowing lights and really cool people makes it that much better.</why><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1206329940000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>8pm Illuminated Frisbee on Cambridge Common</name><id>7589925</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206489600000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/7589925/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/d/c/global_3460060.jpeg</photo_url></item>
