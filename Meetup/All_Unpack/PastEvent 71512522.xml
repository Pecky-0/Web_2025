The band members are seasoned area rockers including drummer Jim Janota (Upper Crust, Bags, Lyres) vocalist Chris Cote (Upper Crust, Seks Bomba, Giant Kings) bassist David Fredette (Upper Crust, Titanics) and guitarists Chris Blue (Georgia Overdrive, Rudds, Rag Iron, United States) and Charles Hansen (Andrea Gillis, Gymnasium, Ross Phasor&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343832843000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley</urlname><id>1116818</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Meeting &amp; Greeting in So.
