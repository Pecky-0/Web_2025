Spring is a great time to gather logs and fallen branches and put them to use in your gardens, mound them up into a hugel bed. It is also the time of year when we notice that the melting snow/ mud season has created pooling. What if we captured and stored that water in the landscape and alleviate erosion issues by building swales? Learn the benefits of the two basic permaculture tools for the landscape. The day will be split between a morning session of creating contour beds and the afternoon will involve building beds using the technique of Hugelkulture. Snacks and Lunch provided (vegetarian).Wear some clothes you don't mind getting dirty, bring gloves, and wear your mud boots!Â  &lt;br /&gt;
