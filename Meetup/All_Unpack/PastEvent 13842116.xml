Anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors can become turned around, separated from a group, or lost and if this happens late in the day it can become an uncomfortable and very frightening situation. But if you are prepared, and know what to do, you can actually enjoy the experience while helping searchers find you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This workshop is designed for women 18 and older.
