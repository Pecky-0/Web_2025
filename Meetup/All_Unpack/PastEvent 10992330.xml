I'll arrive around 5:30 or 5:45. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone want to join me for &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;contra dancing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Cambridge this Friday night (7/31)? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it's last minute, but I was thinking of getting dinner in Porter Square (at a vegetarian-friendly restaurant) and then going to the dance, which starts at 7:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need any experience in contra dancing (or any dancing skill) -- it's very easy, beginners can learn, and regulars are very friendly to newcomers. You get a partner, line up, and do a routine (different routine each time, that the caller walks you through at the beginning); then you move up the line repeating the routine, so you finally know it by the end of the dance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bidadance..." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bidadance....&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $5-$10 + dinner&lt;br /&gt;Bring: dessert to share during break + water bottle + soft-soled dance shoes (see website)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can just come to the dance if you don't want dinner, or vice-versa.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll have a meetup sign at the restaurant and before the dance; at the dance, I'll try to tape sign up on wall</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249687711000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248953138000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Contra dancing--Friday night </name><id>10992330</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249075800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/10992330/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/a/f/global_4486527.jpeg</photo_url></item>
