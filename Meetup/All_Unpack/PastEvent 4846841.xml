Egg custards and jasmine tea and stuff you can't pronounce unless you speak Mandarin or Cantonese!  CHICKEN FEET!!!  Join us for our now-monthly, all-social dimsum events, which will take place at either China Pearl or Hei La Moon in Boston's Chinatown.  We can talk geek, or just eat ourselves silly.  Alas, this is probably not for the vegetarian'd, or the strictly kosher or halal, or the diet-conscious.  The bill will be split evenly among all who attend, so the more the merrier/cheaper!  (Average cost seems to be about $15 per person.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alteration, since several people mentioned they might be able to attend better on Saturday than Sunday.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pam Phillips</member_name><member_id>1902847</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540082000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>SF Writers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-SFandF-Writers</urlname><id>137807</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>The Boston Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1138995819000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston SFWM Dimsum</name><id>4846841</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1141488000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-SFandF-Writers/events/4846841/</event_url></item>
