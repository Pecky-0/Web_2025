Since there's still daylight around 7pm we can take a look at David Homa's land and he also has large drawings of his site.  We will then talk about some permaculture ideas relative to that site, either at David's or at Lisa/David's office in Gorham center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the April meetup we covered the concept of ZONES and SHEET MULCHING.&lt;br /&gt;For May, how about the following permaculture concepts:  EDGE, STACKING, PATTERNS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be learning from each other on mini permaculture topics as well as planning for upcoming events and outreach.  If there's a topic you'd like to talk about, just let us know!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540202000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1145577657000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portland Permaculture May Meetup</name><id>4906866</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1147993200000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/4906866/</event_url></item>
