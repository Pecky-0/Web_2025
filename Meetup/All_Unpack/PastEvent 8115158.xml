Things have been a little crazy to say the least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok since Breakhart always seems to go over really well ( since the dogs can be off leash) let's go again!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the weather won't be TOO hot ( as it's been) &amp;amp; they can run around &amp;amp; play. Hope to see everyone there!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/cool.gif' border='0' alt='cool' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>we'll be the ones w/ the Shiba's</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226768202000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Shiba Inu Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-shiba-inu</urlname><id>792612</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1800003052</group_lon><name>Shiba Inu Meet Up of Eastern MA &amp; Southern NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213100442000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Back to Breakheart</name><id>8115158</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214067600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-shiba-inu/events/8115158/</event_url></item>
