Drive approximately 6 miles. [Once you get in to the &amp;quot;main town&amp;quot; of Hollis, but while you are still on Route 130, you will pass Lull Farms on your left, then Brookdale Farm also on your left. At the fork in the road just past Brookdale Farm, bear right and travel approx one block, passing the Harvest Market shopping center on your right, to the set of lights. There's a bank building with a Dunkin Donuts on that corner, and a little caf√© across the street with a chicken on the sign. Continue with the directions from the Beaver Brook web site below.] ...travel to the set of lights in Hollis (there is only one set of lights in Hollis). Turn left at the lights; you will be on Route 122 South. Drive approximately 1 mile and turn right onto Ridge Road. Drive approximately 1 more mile. Maple Hill Farm will be on your right (117 Ridge Road). You will see a large gray farmhouse with a barn attached to it. The Beaver Brook office is in this building. &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>In Beaver Brook parking lot - on the right</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4894798</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248483520000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247662269000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beaver Brook Hollis, NH</name><id>10881312</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247940000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/10881312/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/9/global_6390313.jpeg</photo_url></item>
