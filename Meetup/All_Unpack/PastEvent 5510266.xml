Please see our &lt;a href="http://gnostic.meetup.com/178/boards/view/viewthread?thread=2770835#7360194"&gt;message board&lt;/a&gt; for details and discussion about this meeting. We had a great first meeting and I really can't wait for our next one!&lt;br /&gt;The church has said that they are almost 100% sure we can meet there again, they just have to check with a group that will be there before us to be sure they will be done. As always, if you have any questions or comments please contact me using the link to the left.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Fr.
