The meetup is currently set to expire mid-November - so one of the things this event will do is help me gauge whether there is sufficient interest to keep the group going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to seeing/meeting you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245795792000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>french-789</urlname><id>1150221</id><group_lat>42.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Boston Metrowest French Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225578250000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The long awaiting next meetup!</name><id>9074028</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226624400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/french-789/events/9074028/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/3/0/global_4128560.jpeg</photo_url></item>
