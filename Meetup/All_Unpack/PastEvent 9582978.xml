A ski trail leads around Sandy Pond, over the grounds of the &lt;a href="http://www.decordova.org/decordova/sculp_park/sculp_park.html" target="_blank"&gt;DeCordova Sculpture Park&lt;/a&gt;.  The more ambitious can take a side trips to Walden Pond and/or to the steepish slopes of Mount Misery to obtain views of the Sudbury river in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The train is the Fitchburg Commuter Rail.  It stops at Porter Square (Red Line) at 8:45AM.  It arrives in Lincoln at 9:12AM, hence the early start to the trip.  Return trains leave at 12:05PM and 2:40PM.  Drivers can park at the Commuter Rail lot.  It's a short walk from the train station to where we can ski.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll break into up to four groups, depending on desire and ability each with a map.  The trails aren't groomed, but they will probably have been tracked by the many locals who'll have gone before us.  Unfortunately, the only way to get maps was to order them from the town, so I can recoup my costs if a few of you buy a $5 map from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the snow will stay until at least that date.  We're even due to get a little more.  Please park in the commuter rail lot or at the Lincoln Elementary School on Ballfield Road.  If you park at the &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=ballfield+road,+lincoln,+ma&amp;amp;sll=42.463667,-71.430718&amp;amp;sspn=0.009276,0.013947&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=16" target="_blank"&gt;Lincoln Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; give me a call.  It's a half-mile ski or walk from there to the train station or you can wait for us there, because the trail leads along it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Dark blue hat with lettering and blue plume</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yoris</member_name><member_id>8043284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1233584231000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1232681154000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ski Lincoln Conservation Land from the T</name><id>9582978</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233411300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/9582978/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/d/global_7035501.jpeg</photo_url></item>
