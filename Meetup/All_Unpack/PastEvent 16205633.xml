At 2.5 miles, it was the longest private freight-and-passenger railroad in the United States. We will hike along the one-mile portion owned by the Manchester Land Conservation Trust, and on to Center Springs Park, which will take about 1-3/4 hours round trip. Leader will bring vintage pictures and provide historic commentary on the Cheney railroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet at the North End of Main Street in Manchester, on the north (right-hand) side of Farr’s Sporting Goods, 2 Main Street. Park at the nearby shopping plaza or Eighth Utilities District office building; please do not park in Farr's parking lot. A special favor will be given to children who attend the hike, sponsored by the Connecticut Forest &amp;amp; Park Association's family ramble program, but open to all, especially those interested in local history. Extreme weather cancels. No dogs. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue backpack</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298853823000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hiking™ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296128338000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cheney railroad walk, Manchester</name><id>16205633</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1298743200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/16205633/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/5/f/global_10030703.jpeg</photo_url></item>
