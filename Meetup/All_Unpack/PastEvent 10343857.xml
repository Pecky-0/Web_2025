<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It is that time again!  Join us for an awesome workshop on Facebook application development.  We will cover the basics of the platform, dig deeper to learn about the APIs and other nuts and bolts, develop an application together and provide take home code so that you can get started with you own application development.  For the meeting we will be using PHP and MySQL for development, but knowing either is optional - if possible you should have some basic idea of how general web application development is done (HTML, etc).  Our agenda will be as follows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Introductions and hellos&lt;br /&gt;2. Architecture Basics of Facebook&lt;br /&gt;3. Setting up your Development Sandbox&lt;br /&gt;4. Facebook Markup Langauge (tag based development)&lt;br /&gt;5. Facebook Query Langauge (getting data out of Facebook)&lt;br /&gt;6. Facebook API (getting more data out of Facebook)&lt;br /&gt;7. Building our Application&lt;br /&gt;8. Q and A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We sincerely appreciate the Yankee Group hosting the event for us and want to thank our member Jarrett Sloan for making it possible!
