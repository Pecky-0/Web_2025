The area as used as a farm since the 1600’s, and a silver mine and spring water bottling business was there also. The park is 350 acres with a pond, hills, and hiking trails. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Next to the park is the Osborne Homestead and Kellogg Environmental Education center. You may visit the center after our walk if you like. I am not sure about admission costs. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

This will be an easy walk of about 2.5 miles with moderate up hills. Social walking pace. We will be out for 2 hours or as fate may have it. I have not visited this place in many years, and I will be following the trail map. Afterwards we will have a picnic lunch at the picnic area. Alcohol beverages are not allowed (local rules in this park.) The walk will be rescheduled if there is a threat of rain. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Dogs and children are welcome as long as they are calm and well behaved. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
