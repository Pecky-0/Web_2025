Reviewers say &amp;quot;Udupi is the best all-vegetarian restaurant in the area. A warning - it is no frills. Paper plates, plastic utensils, no art on the wall, cheap-o tables and chairs, cafeteria style - but the best damn food you will ever eat&amp;quot;  and &amp;quot;The staff is hilarious and helpful with the intimidating menu. Try the Samosa Chaat, Batura is amazing, Mango Lassis - another yes. I've also had bisi bele bhath (??name??), it's a rice and lentil dish with vegetables, and the dosas are great. You really can't go wrong. Bring $20 and eat like a queen!&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of parking.  No alcohol served, but you are invited to bring your own. I will collect $1.00 from attendees to defray costs of running this group.  PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE AND SHOW UP IF YOU R.S.V.P. &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Website:   &lt;a href="http://www.ctudupi.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.ctudupi.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is cafeteria style - pay at the counter when you order, you may arrive anytime between 6:30 to 7:30, I plan to be there at 7:00pm.  I am putting a limit of 20 people, but if you end up on a wait list - come join us anyway.  The manager said he would make room. The more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Betsy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Small place - easy to find us.
