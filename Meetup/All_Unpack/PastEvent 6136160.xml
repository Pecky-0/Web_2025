<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I'm sorry it has taken so long to post this. I have had a severe allergic reaction for almost 2 weeks. I hope some folks managed to see David Lindahl in Dedham. We'd like to hear your impressions. I have been processing a &amp;quot;Short Sale&amp;quot; this past month with a great deal of help form my friend Derek Ebrecht. I will speak about it and answer any ?s that come up. I dont' expect it to be a very high attendance, so you may get a chance to bring up a ? or 2 that you need answered. I'll see you there. dale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have to add much to that description. This meeting is falling on Labor Day, and I don't like changing dates. We had a meeting on New Years Day and the turnout was decent. Having smaller meetings at times gives more folks a chance to ask ?s. I am still hoping that some of you will come up with some requests and ideas as to what subjects you would like to see presented starting in October. I'd love to hear any comments and ?s you may have. dale&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>dale</member_name><member_id>3116571</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189033865000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186445153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club September Meetup</name><id>6136160</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188860400000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/6136160/</event_url></item>
