&lt;p&gt;We will be hiking and spelunking for about three hours. Please bring a flashlight, some good hiking shoes, courage, and food as we will have lunch on top of the mountain. This is a very easy hike and anyone can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cave is dark, so bring a flashlight! If you are afraid of the dark you can hike around the cave and meet us at the top of the cave where we will group and then hike to the top of the mountain. The total trip should be about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be joined by other meetup groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your convinnce there is a "Hanafords" supermarket right next to the "McDonald's" that way you can get&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;extra food for your leader!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any questions my phone number is: 603-312-6735&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please try to be there on time as we will depart McDonald's at 10:15 am. Please anticipate any delays in traffic and arrive early as everyone wants to go spelunking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $2. donation would be appreciated for running this event and this meetup group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
