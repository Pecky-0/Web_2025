Heidi Moon, one of our wonderful members, has offered to host this event for us at her home in Jamestown, RI. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soda, beer and wine and some basic deli food will be served, but feel free to bring a favorite dish or drink to add to the selection. There is a beach across the street so bring your bathing suit if the weather blesses us with some late summer sun and warm temperatures. Heidi also has two kayaks, which she has offered us to use to paddle in the water around the harbor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come join us for a nice afternoon by the ocean - it would be great to see many of you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hurry up and sign up - there is a limit to the participants to this event :-)! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon, take care and enjoy the summer! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heidi Moon &amp;amp; Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a German flag! </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heidi</member_name><member_id>10288742</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283179403000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280969257000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>End of Summer Event in Beautiful Jamestown, RI</name><id>14323716</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1283104800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/14323716/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
