Very close to both C and D lines, and there is parking on street.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;In a NEW and more spacious private location. Less kitchen so make the pre-ritual food snacky and easy to eat. EGGS a suggested theme for this season. Your own utensils are a good idea, as what Maiyim has now is very limited.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Please check your RSVP and change if necessary. We have room for a few more women.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;We gather between 6:30 - 7:45 for eats, socializing and unwinding from the day and then create our ritual circle together. Shall we call it neo-pagan eclectic? Honoring elements of many traditions and always open to participants leading parts of the simple circle and healing ritual.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;Bring goodies to share, items you want to charge on the altar we will lay together, candles, seeds are suggested for this time and we can bless them, maybe a pillow to sit upon. We may want to use writing in the ritual, so you might bring your journal or note book.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span&gt;We will complete our circle by ten, and then linger to ground with tea and snacks as the Goddesses wish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Location in Brookline,very close to both C and D lines, with on street parking, will be given to members who RSVP.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Maiyim</member_name><member_id>63013452</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1364862212000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Goddess</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>goddess-327</urlname><id>1289522</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Goddess Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1360435757000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Welcome Spring Friday March 22, 2013</name><id>103831422</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>12600000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1363991400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/goddess-327/events/103831422/</event_url></item>
