&lt;p&gt;With&amp;nbsp;less than one week before the start of the 2012 Regular Season it will be time for Red Sox Natives and their guests to gather for Sunday worship at the Clarendon Hill Presbyterian Church in Somerville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worship begins at 10:30 a.m. It is Palm Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please arrive at 10:15 a.m. to meet and sit with other Natives in Row 7 on the Left side of the Church nearest the piano. The Clarendon Hill Presbyterian Church welcomes all people, faithful or seeking, to join in their shared journey of faith. They are a small but growing congregation. Their resources may be limited but their imagination and desires are not. Pastor Karl Gustafson will bless the Red Sox Natives and the upcoming 2012 Red Sox season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of services (about 11:30 am) we will walk&amp;nbsp;or car pool to Davis Square or Ball square for an informal breakfast. Cost is what you eat and drink.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church is located near the Davis Square Red Line (Exit Holland Street, walk up hill to Teele Square, to Curtis Street 3 blocks to corner of Powderhouse Blvd.) about a 12 to 15 minute walk. Resident Parking rules in Somerville are not in force on Sundays.

&lt;p&gt;We will be inviting several other groups to join us. Check back for future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event&amp;nbsp;previously took place prior to the 2010 season.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP if you will be attending. Guests are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
