They pay homage to Ullr, the god of snow with various activities from 1-6pm. It is free! They'll have a bonfire, munchies, sleigh rides (which may be led by dogs or horses, but it doesn't specify), a costume contest and parade, a drum circle, and you can bring your own wine. You might be able to bring your own snowshoes and walk around but I don't know, you should check with them first.
