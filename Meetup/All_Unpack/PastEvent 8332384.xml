<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Marc and I will be hosting a hike up Mount Toby.  This is about a 4 mile hike, up the Tower Road to the firetower atop Mount Toby.  Outcrops of a coarse conglomerate called pudding stone, steep ravines, forested hollows, marshy bottoms and dry ridges.  Forty two varieties of ferns, and even orchids can be found here.  The Tower Road is closed to vehicles, and most of the way we will be hiking next to a mountain stream.  Please be sure to have your dog on-leash, at least to begin with, until we know how we all get along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the junction of Massachusetts Route 63 and 47 (in Sunderland, 4.5 miles south of Millers Falls, 8 miles north of North Amherst center), go south on Route 47 for 1 mile and turn left onto Reservation Road.  Find the gated trailhead on the right in 0.5 miles, with parking in another 50 feet next to a small headquarters building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Route 47 and Route 116 intersection in the center of Sunderland, go north on Route 47 for 3.8 miles and turn right onto Reservation Road.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Kristi will be near the entrance sign with a red baseball cap&amp; black lab</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristi</member_name><member_id>7010444</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216746796000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Dog lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>WesternMassDogs</urlname><id>1085798</id><group_lat>42.5400009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5299987793</group_lon><name>Western Mass Dogs - Walks and more!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215966111000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Exploring Mount Toby, Sunderland</name><id>8332384</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216573200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/WesternMassDogs/events/8332384/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/4/b/6/global_4769302.jpeg</photo_url></item>
