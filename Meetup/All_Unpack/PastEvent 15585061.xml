Their first event is December 1st at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where people will be gathering at 6:30PM to tour the new Art of the Americas wing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At ~8:30PM, the group will head to a local bar TBD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  At the MFA, we'll meet in the New American Cafe at 6.30pm.&lt;br /&gt;2.  If you can't make the MFA part of the night, meet us at the Savant Project (1625 Tremont Street; Brigham Circle stop on the Green Line).  We'll try to get there around 8.30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How About We is a subscription dating site organized around date-ideas, that started in NYC and recently raised $3.1M in a venture capital round led by RRE Ventures.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Museum lobby at 6:30PM--meet up with the How About We group</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lenny</member_name><member_id>11697178</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291250887000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>singles-1958</urlname><id>1096649</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge and Boston Singles Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1291057311000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A Night at the Museum</name><id>15585061</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291246200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/singles-1958/events/15585061/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/7/8/global_3699192.jpeg</photo_url></item>
