Then join us for dinner at Bertucci's Restaurant in Framingham. We will enjoy dinner, then swap books. Book swap is optional. you can still come and enjoy dinner and hanging out. This is always a popular event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure that your books are in excellent condition, may be hardcover or paperback. Please no textbooks! You may bring two or three books if you would like.
