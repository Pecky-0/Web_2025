The $10 buffet is all-vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you this Friday night, August 13, for a night of spiritual poetry being presented by Ravi Nathwani, one of the editors of a recent New World Library publication called Mala of the Heart. The book contains 108 sacred poems from different religious/spiritual traditions celebrating &amp;quot;the eternal spiritual truth within each heart. These poems span a wide range of cultures and civilizations — from India to Europe, Japan, and the Middle East — and each one offers a unique perspective &lt;br /&gt;about the path to awakening.&amp;quot; Almost all of the ancient poets featured in the book lived and died between 1200 and 1900.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our presenter Ravi Nathwani was born and raised in India in the Vaishnav Hindu tradition. He gives lectures, workshops, and teacher trainings in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Bhagavad Gita as well as leads Buddhist meditation. He teaches at Tufts University and at JFK University in California's Bay Area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you this Friday night for a night of poetry and discussion, not to mention meditation at 6:30 and a delicious vegetarian dinner at 7:00. Ravi will start speaking around 7:45. Below is one of the poems from Mala of the Heart. (The term &amp;quot;Mala&amp;quot; in this tradition does NOT mean BAD, as it does in Western cultures.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We look forward to seeing you there! We'll be there from 6:30pm to 9:00 pm, since we are to stay for the entire talk if we come for the vegan buffet dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope that you, friends, and family will join us this Friday night at 6:30 for meditation followed by our Chinese, vegan buffet at 7:00 pm and the presentation at 7:45 pm.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Don't think of it like 'skid row derelicts' who are required to stay through the preaching when they come for the free food; instead, consider this a delightful community building exercise for us because, even in this context, we are very special and have much to contribute to one another by contributing to the wider, public discussion among the many others who ALSO attend this dharma talk after the buffet.]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cost (Include dinner) &lt;br /&gt;Adult: $10 Student: $5 (student ID required)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CASH ONLY.
