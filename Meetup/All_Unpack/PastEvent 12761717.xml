And the novel itself is often associated with the nineteen-fifties and the time when people first started talking about “alienation” and “the youth culture&amp;quot;.  In fact, Catcher is a post-war novel. It is not a celebration of youth. It is a book about loss and a world gone crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it maybe strange to call Salinger a war writer, the war made Salinger Salinger. He spent most of the WWII with the 4th Infantry Division, in a counter-intelligence unit.  His Division suffered terrible casualties, and Salinger admitted in letters he wrote at the time, that he was traumatized. He fought in the advance on Berlin, and in the summer of 1945, he was hospitalized after suffering a nervous breakdown. Shortly after he was released, he wrote the first story narrated by Holden Caulfield. It was called “I’m Crazy.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To truly understand Salinger and the &amp;quot;The Catcher in Rye's&amp;quot; real undercurrent one has to read his early work, the short stories, six of which appeared in the New Yorker.  Thus, I invite you to read and come prepared to discuss these stories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A Perfect Day for Bananafish” &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Laughing Man&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; “For Esmé—with Love and Squalor”&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Teddy&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arlinda S.</member_name><member_id>4452084</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268777305000</updated><rating><average>4.19999980927</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Book Club Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>classicbooks</urlname><id>518343</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Classic Books: Book Club for Die-hard Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267569879000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salinger: Short Stories</name><id>12761717</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268604000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/classicbooks/events/12761717/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/7/global_5819031.jpeg</photo_url></item>
