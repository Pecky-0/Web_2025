We will start the group by listening to a pre-recorded talk by Arinna Weisman, meditation teacher, author, and founder of the Insight Meditation Society of Pioneer Valley. Her joy seems to radiate from her words and voice as she presents a &amp;quot;Calling on the quality of joy to manifest in our lives.&amp;quot; This will be followed by a short meditation and discussion about our talk of the evening and what we can bring into our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world. We'd love to have you join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Please try to get there by 6:00pm as they have asked us to keep the door locked due to recent security issues. If you arrive after 6pm and there's no one at the door, please ring the night buzzer (it's right by the door and is labeled as there are two buzzers). We'll come down and get you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289431424000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268852474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arinna Weisman: Cultivating Joy</name><id>qmmdnynpblb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289257200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/15264901/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/global_5310195.jpeg</photo_url></item>
