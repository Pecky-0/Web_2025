People often refer to it in terms of what happens when you do something wrong. But it also involves the good things that come to us as a result of acts of kindness and selflessness. Karma teaches us to take responsibility for every thought, word, and action so that we eventually learn to stand on our own two feet spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about karma, why it's an important spiritual law of life, and share experiences of having been taught good lessons by the hand of karma. You are always welcome to share or listen with an open heart to the experiences of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll meet from 7pm to 8pm, in the upstairs meeting room of the Whiton Library. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
