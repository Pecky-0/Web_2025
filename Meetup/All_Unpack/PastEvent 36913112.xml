Last year it was a blast! Perfect for kids age 2-10. There is a interactive dance performance for kids, Halloween-themed, with snacks, goodie bags, raffles, arts and crafts, face painting and more! Tickets are $15.00 in advance and $18.00 at the door. Children under age 3 are free. Let me know if you could come and I will reserve tickets at advance price for you. Hope to see you there!
