Try to keep it high on the fruits &amp;amp; vegetable side. If you don't know what to bring, a bunch of fruit or a salad would work. :) Organic food is always best.&amp;nbsp; Don't forget your camera! :) &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Derry-Raw-Vegan-Meetup/events/52172092/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com/Derry-Raw-Vegan-Meetup/events/52172092/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 I'll be showing you how to prepare a beautiful raw dessert, that you can eat any time of the day. It only takes 5 minutes!&amp;nbsp; Then we can feast on the wonderful raw dishes you all brought.&amp;nbsp; And we'll finish off the night with a fun group game. &lt;br /&gt;

 ITEMS THAT ARE BEST LEFT OUT &lt;br /&gt;

 There are some people with food allergies, so these items would be best left out, to make it fair to others. &lt;br /&gt;

 * Cacao [ Some people can't have caffeine ]Subsitute: carob&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

 * Cashews [ They are not raw. Before cashews are heated, they're black in color and highly toxic. Once high heat is applied to them, they turn white and are then edible but not raw.] Subsitute: Almonds &lt;br /&gt;

 *honey, bee pollen [ They are not vegan ] Subsitute: Dates &lt;br /&gt;

 * Vinegar&amp;nbsp; [Can cause yeast imbalances in some people] Subsitute: Lime or lemon juice &lt;br /&gt;

 *Nama Shoyu/tamari/Bragg's liquid aminos [ These items contain wheat gluten and many people are gluten intolerant] Subsitute: Blend Mushrooms &amp;amp; Salt (Or celery powder) &lt;br /&gt;

 * Nutritional yeast [Contains yeast &amp;amp; small amounts of the neurotoxin, MSG] &lt;br /&gt;

 * Agave&amp;nbsp; [It is not raw and it is a very very highly processed product.] Subsitute: Dates &lt;br /&gt;

 * Oils [ A highly refined food, stripped of all fiber, protein, carbs and nutrients, it is 100% fat] Substitute: High fat foods; such as blended coconut, or nuts &lt;br /&gt;

 * Try to keep the Sea Salt to a bear minimum [ Sea Salt (80% Sodium Chloride) irritates the taste buds to become inflamed and sensitive, thus "enhancing" the flavor of the food, but ends up damaging the taste buds. It also drains the water from your cells, causing dehydration ] Subsitute: Celery Powder. You can make your own or buy some online.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It will be hosted in the Church's "Fellowship Hall".</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>36054642</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330415209000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RawBoston</urlname><id>733136</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Raw Food Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330189368000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>RAW VEGAN POTLUCK &amp; MINI UNCOOKING CLASS!
