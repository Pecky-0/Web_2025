This hike will be around 8 miles and should take at least a few hours. The terrain is described as &amp;quot;rugged&amp;quot; so be prepared for a somewhat strenuous hike (at least as far as RI hikes go). We'll meet at the Beach Pond Parking lot, you take 95 to rt 165 all the way to Beach Pond. Look for my bright yellow Escape, its impossible to miss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Jenn Brown and I are leading a series of hikes to prepare us for the Mt Washington hike on Memorial Day weekend. We are starting with some easier ones and working our way up to some more difficult terrain and elevation gains, so if you go on a bunch of these then you should be ready to tackle Washington with us in late May.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the bright yellow escape or call my cell 508 414 8544.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8198993</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271599287000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268489271000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beach Pond Pachaug Trail</name><id>12865776</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1270998000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/12865776/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/c/global_13613548.jpeg</photo_url></item>
