The movie times have been posted for this weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come see the new Resident Evil movie in 3D this weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience a new dimension in action horror as director Paul W.S. Anderson uses the 3D technology pioneered by James Cameron and Vincent Pace to take movie lovers on a nightmare thrill-ride. It's been five years since the zombie virus swept across the globe, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still traveling tirelessly in search of survivors. When the Umbrella Corporation ratchets up the stakes, an old friend turns up to lend Alice a helping hand. Rumor has it that some survivors have found sanctuary in Los Angeles, but when Alice and friends show up they find the city overrun with zombies, and quickly realize they've stumbled into a diabolical trap. - Jason Buchanan, Rovi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be outside the theater (or right inside the lobby if the weather's an issue) a half hour before the movie starts and will go inside to get seats 15 minutes before show time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn</member_name><member_id>9373103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284906864000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284581085000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D</name><id>14782933</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284841800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/14782933/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
