Yes, I am a GIGANTIC fan which is apparent because each time this group parties, I place it on the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/portuguese-316/"&gt;Portuguese &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonOnyxbirds/"&gt;Onyxbirds&lt;/a&gt; Meetup calendars. Since dinner is an option, I've also invited the Meetup dining group, &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/brunchclub-107/"&gt;Breakfast Brunch Lunch &amp;amp; Dinner&lt;/a&gt;.  Let's pack the place again, because the more the merrier and also your presence will convince Johnny D's to keep the Bloco AfroBrazil party on their schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloco AfroBrazil is a 12-piece percussion ensemble that always puts on a spectacular show combining traditional Brazilian grooves like Samba and Ax√© with Funk, Rock, Jazz and even Hip Hop; add to this, (who will get you in rhythm)and you got a recipe for FUN, Brazilian style!! Bring your dance shoes or socks and leave your worries at the door!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your friends....I guarantee a funtastic time, that is if you like your music strong and your party loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You must be at least 21&lt;/b&gt; but you don't have to drink, just enjoy each others company and an AMAZING! show.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the drumming, singing and dancing start, group conversation is difficult. Let's just enjoy the party!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;$10 cash cover charge at the door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you want to be included in the 8:30 PM dinner reservation you must also order at least $10 (this is in addition to $10 cover) in food and/or drink....otherwise you're welcome to enjoy the show from the bar or dance floor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you come for just the music, stop by the dinner table to say hello and so you can meet folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/menus/dinner.html"&gt;Johnny D's Dinner Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PLEASE MAINTAIN YOUR OWN TAB OR PAY AS YOU ORDER - THANK YOU&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.johnnyds.com/parking.html"&gt;Map of Nearby Municiple Parking Lots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING------SOME METERS ARE OPERATIONAL UNTIL 10 PM------WARNING&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Cambridge (Harvard Square):  &lt;br /&gt;From Harvard Square travel north on Massachusetts Avenue and pass the porter Square T-Station and the Porter Square Shopping Center on the right.
