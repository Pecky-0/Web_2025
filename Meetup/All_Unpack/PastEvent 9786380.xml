Susan, I know... I know... I need to get out of the South End :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... since I received such positive feedback about our early dinner and cocktails at the Gaslight, how about  a return visit on Sunday April 5th? To be fair, there were quite a few people who couldn't make it the first time. Besides... it's a great place and there's plenty.... of free parking. lol &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocktail @ 5:00PM and dinner @ 6:00 or 6:30PM at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gaslight, Brasserie du Coin&lt;br /&gt;560 Harrison Ave&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA 02118&lt;br /&gt;(617) 422-0224&lt;br /&gt;Price: Reasonable&lt;br /&gt;www.gaslight560.com (check them out on the web)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gaslight, Brasserie du Coin, (literally brasserie on the corner) is The Aquitaine Groupâ€™s classic neighborhood Parisian brasserie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you at Gaslight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Michael&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reservation will be under Mike</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240415188000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>12</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>20</yes_rsvp_count><created>1235170932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Return to the Gaslight?
