<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Changes have been made between IBD and Meetup.com and much has happened with the way IBD will support Meetup groups from now on. This has in turn resulted in changes that have an effect on the nature and format of our future meetings. First on this month's adgenda will be a review of these changes and an open discussion regarding the groups thoughts with respect to those changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that... at last month's meeting we arbitrarily chose a stock (ALB - Albemarle Corp.) to do an experimental trade with. Each member was to paper trade a maximum lot size of 100 shares using whatever strategies they saw fit. The only rules were that no more than 100 shares could be &amp;quot;on the table&amp;quot; at any given time and no options plays could be used. We will take a look at the results of those trades at this month's meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the other half of this experiment we will be selecting another stock using the CAN SLIM method this month, so be sure to check the various ratings etc. in IBD in preparation for your suggestions for a potential trade candidate. Remember... selection needs to be based on IBD/CAN SLIM for this trade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this meeting is after-hours, we are free to use the Library's parking lot. Our meeting room is downstairs and just to the right of the staircase (the Peace Dale Room).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcomers are certainly welcome, so  if you know of others who might be interested in joining us, please refer them to this site or just bring them along to the meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see you all there, and look forward to a lively meeting!
