I mean the basics is its a giant maze and you have to get from start to finish but there's several other challenges to make it more difficult, like collecting various clues and other random funness!!!  Overall, I was thinking we could split into groups and see who makes it out first after completing everything, which could take upwards of 3 hours but probably less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a better way to spend one of the last warmer weekends of the fall.  It's still suppose to be in the 50s all weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is $17 a person but if we can organize a group of 20 before Sunday, we can all go for only $10.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's see if we can make this happen.  Pass along to friends and let's get it going.  Obviously the biggest hurdle is finding some people to drive.  So if you have a car and are willing to drive, please rsvp and let me know asap.  I'm sure your fellow incubators would be willing to split up the gas cost as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other thoughts or questions?  Let me know.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock on! and Let's be aMAZEing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason J.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be lost in the maze, find me!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1226624711000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1225903450000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Kickin It Social Style Part 2:  Davis Farmland MegaMaze!!!!</name><id>9099227</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1226242800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/9099227/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
