Perhaps in a few months we can throw in an occasional Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about Sunday evenings? Strong feelings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who's up for an integral practices day? I'll teach yoga. Scott, maybe you want to teach some finer point of Integral Theory? Mark, perhaps you'd like to teach something? (because we know you're a good teacher... Nicole would you forward this to him; I don't think he's joined up yet. And would you like to lead some practice or teaching?) Nancy, maybe you want to lead some exploration into the psychodynamic realm? Ted? Carolyn? Joe? Anyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you all have many talents.. Let's offer them up to the group. It doesn't have to be merely an instructional gathering. Perhaps you perform? Know something about nutrition? Want to lead some creative games (my personal favorites: &amp;quot;exquisite corpse poetry&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fictionary&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nicedog.com/carol/corpse/corpse_howto.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nicedog.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~axellute/fictiony.html)?" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.rci.rutger...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or would like to offer a tutorial on computer skills...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this idea (I'm thinking like 6 hours on a Saturday, maybe November 5, 11am-5pm ish) help me to develop the vision and program. After a solid afternoon, we can go out to dinner and a movie (or dancing!) if people want to extend the day into the night. I'm posting this message on our message board. Please make any comments there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, don't forget to RSVP for this meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings!&lt;br /&gt;Lauren&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/dining/restaurant/1016" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.boston.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/35709144" target="_blank"&gt;http://boston.citysea...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nicole Trudel Churchill</member_name><member_id>3348175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273539929000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>kenwilber-88</urlname><id>91062</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Integral Commons (Ken Wilber group)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1128646493000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Ken Wilber Group October Meetup</name><id>4778101</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1129677300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/kenwilber-88/events/4778101/</event_url></item>
