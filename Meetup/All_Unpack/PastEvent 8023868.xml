These reveries have crashed, hard, into reality. Phillip, whose novel garnered instant acclaim and turned him into a mini-celebrity, has had a terrifying breakdown. Erik, who never sold his novel, is still pecking away, determined to follow in the footsteps of his undying hero, a reclusive but idolized writing genius. Nimbly moving both backwards and forwards in time?via a dazzling mix of flashbacks, rapid-fire editing, philosophical voiceovers and comical flights of fancy?the film traces how Erik and Phillip arrived at this precipice where exuberant youth runs into the harsh light of day?and witnesses the emotionally gripping aftermath. Directed and co-written by Joachim Trier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Manohla Dargis &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;: I write, therefore I am. Or so Phillip and Erik seem to believe, as they throw themselves into a life of literature (it might as well be cinema) with all the attendant clichés, like their disdain for (terror of) women. What Phillip, Erik and their swaggering boys? club don?t initially grasp is that what makes the greater, more interesting man is living in the world ? living with other people, other histories, with the present and past both. We breathe the same air breathed by earlier generations, who pondered the same imponderables and sometimes made great art about those imponderables. You can learn from the past because, while writing is thinking, so, too, are reading books and watching films. We watch, therefore we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;We watch, therefore we are.&lt;/u&gt;  Might be a good starting point for our after-film discussion!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy everyone's looking at during the closing credits wondering what sign he's holding up.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2321575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1212706240000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>The movie, the convivial conversation afterwards at a local eatery, John's incredible car towing tale.
