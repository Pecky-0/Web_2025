&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different restaurant, event and bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: E&amp;amp;O Tap - on Knight Street (near the Avery) over on the West Side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E&amp;amp;O Tap is a FAVORITE with P-Collective Members! Its a little tough to find (they have a sign that's lit up now) but well worth it. Located in a neighborhood setting, its a small brick building with a big, lit up "E" and "O" on the two windows.Â  Considered "a bit divey, but in a cool, hipster kinda way" and a great place to end a night on the West Side, it's located in same area as the Avery (okay, you're almost an RI'er if you know where that is - LOL!). Be forewarned, they don't serve food, but the bartender has a plethora of menus to pick from for delivery - so its kind of the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back by request and popular demand, come over to E&amp;amp;O for some fun and good cheer on the 24th, and let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome... Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Ever. Except Hurricane Sandy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Val is hosting this one, please look at her picture!
