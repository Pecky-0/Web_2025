 &lt;br /&gt;Join Greater Worcester Humanists in September for our yearly "Humanism" centered meeting. We like to take the opportunity once a year to share what Humanism is and what it means to us as individuals and as a group. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to arrive and mingle around 6:30 PM. We will begin the formal meeting at 7 PM with an overview of the past years events and speakers. As always this and most of our events are open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then have our small group discussions, each headed by two members of our Steering and Outreach Committees. The committee members will head off discussions at each table by relating. &amp;nbsp;This years topic is about how you live out your Humanistic values. &amp;nbsp;Do you openly express your Humanism and try to explain it to people, or do you let it guide you in your decision making process? &amp;nbsp;Everyone is a little different, why not share? &amp;nbsp;The committee members will start with&amp;nbsp;their individual stories and then invite individuals to share their experiences. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Moran</member_name><member_id>7617544</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316173890000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>worcesterhumanists</urlname><id>1218349</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Greater Worcester Humanists</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309550342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paths to Humanism 2011 - Living our Humanist Values</name><id>24259561</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1315954800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/worcesterhumanists/events/24259561/</event_url></item>
