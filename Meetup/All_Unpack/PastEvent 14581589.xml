THIS EVENT IS CANCELED.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;    Please join Steve O. and friends at anytime for late afternoon of fun and easy exercise, or just come to watch. Wimp Volleyball is a noncompetitive games. Totally for the fun of moving around trying to hit and return the ball. We will be following the rules. But, having fun, and learning will be more important than winning. We work on trying to keeping the volley going. Rather than trying to end the volley.  We count the laughs, not the score. The winners are those who sides hurt from laughing to much.  We usually have a larger number attending. So, we will rotate everyone through. If we have enough of those people who must win to play, and follow exactly to the rules. We will have another net set up for them. So, bring your friends and teens, an your drinks to keep cool and hydrated and Bug repellent. &lt;br /&gt;      Also we often go out afterwords ( 8 pm. ) for some food or drink. So, plan to join us for that also.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;    We will also have another event going at the same time, Wimp Volleyball Chatting &amp;amp; Cheerleading. This event requires a lawn chair and the ability to chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     We will be asking for a $1.00 donation to help play for the equipment. But please remember, your attends is more important than the your money. We would rather you play than pay. The money is only to help pay for and maintain the equipment. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>look for the Meetup sign on our Volleyball net and our cars.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1283383098000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
