<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a very good film about Mike Reynolds, an architect and the creator of Earthships (and other sustainable dwellings).  The film gives us an opportunity to learn about this compelling man, hear the fascinating story of his buildings and learn about his work on behalf of people and the planet.  The film will likely inspire us as permaculturists to take action on the issues we care about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone interested in permaculture, green building, natural building, &amp;quot;change agency&amp;quot; or activism will want to attend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.garbagewarrior.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.garbagewar...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Special treat:  A cameo appearance in the film by one of our own members (&lt;a href="http://permaculture.meetup.com/58/members/2670503/"&gt;http://permaculture.m...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The film has alot of language that would earn it an R-rating so if that's a problem for you, consider skipping this event.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a potluck supper event, but &lt;b&gt;let's share desserts at 7:00&lt;/b&gt; with the film to start at 7:30pm.  Run time is about 90 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget your potluck kit as it applies to dessert.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217335209000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215707876000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Film Screening:  Garbage Warrior</name><id>8314716</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217026800000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/8314716/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/2/f/global_4738655.jpeg</photo_url></item>
