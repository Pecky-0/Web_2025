<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Hoerman's have moved (more or less!) and will be having a large tag sale, indoors in both the house and the barn, at the old house in Colchester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We invite any club member who has some odds and ends you'd like to sell to join us.  You can come Friday evening to set up if you have alot.  We'll need plenty of tables -- plan to bring some if you can and let the Hoerman's know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two requests:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Make a donation to the club from the proceeds of what you sell -- you set the amount.&lt;br /&gt;2)  You must take anything you bring and do not sell back with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to bring snacks, drinks, and something to share at lunch time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertised hours for the sale will be 8:00 to 2:00.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gloria</member_name><member_id>1099810</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Linda</member_name><member_id>3403216</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214827657000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-28</urlname><id>364032</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6699981689</group_lon><name>Hartford Heights Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212025986000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tag Sale</name><id>8032006</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214654400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-28/events/8032006/</event_url></item>
