This event will be at the Odiorne Point State Park, we will be meeting in the &amp;quot;Science Center&amp;quot; there. One of our members graciously offered us the place for this party! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This game is not a board game; everyone will be participating at the same time; you must not be afraid of the dark, and you must dress all in black clothing! This is not a show ( the Murder Mystery Show is a week earlier on March 13th at the Governors Inn, you don't want to miss that one) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be having a potluck before the game so bring something special. We will meet at 6 pm to socialize at which time I will explain the game and give a brief tour of the building then at 7pm the mystery will start. This is not a child event so please do not bring your children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipate we will have a fairly large amount of people coming so I will be limiting the number of people for this event to 85. I may be combining this with some other meetup groups. &lt;br /&gt;More details will follow as we get closer to the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please wear sneakers or comfortable walking shoes. ***Remember to wear nothing but &amp;quot;black clothing&amp;quot;*** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the event we will be dancing/socialing next to the &amp;quot;Tidal Pool&amp;quot; so bring your dancing shoes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi I would like everyone to know that this event is a &amp;quot;no-alcohol event&amp;quot;, so please do not bring any alchol to the event.
