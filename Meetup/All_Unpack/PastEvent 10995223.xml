Nestled just off the beaten path in Boston’s Back Bay Neighborhood, this choice dining establishment caters to guests who are looking to surpass their expectations and indulge in the results of unique and flavorful creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine- if you can, a destination with every amenity under one roof- each room providing a multitude of options. Whether hosting a company event in our video conferencing equipped Private Dining Room- affectionately known as &amp;quot;La Galleria&amp;quot;, planning that perfect quiet dinner, letting loose in the lounge, or simply enjoying our sun-kissed patio, we pride ourselves in providing the ideal atmosphere to suit your mood.&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-owners Greg Den Herder and Igor Blatnik, in collaboration with 3SIX0 architectural designers Chris Bardt and Kyna Leski, have created a spatial experience from light and the creation of colors only seen in paradise. Highlights of the design include sensuous LED lit stairwalls that become the bar as one moves through, purple heart floors, rolling maple ceilings, and brick arches-collectively producing a feeling of &amp;quot;prismatic warmth”. All the while, a state-of-the-art sound system unobtrusively surrounds guests with the latest beats.&lt;br /&gt;Cuisine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;33 Restaurant &amp;amp; Lounge features a popular Contemporary American menu, uniquely fusing traditional New England cuisine with hints of the exotic. Under the guidance of Executive Cheff Joshua P. Botsford, using the best locally grown produce, freshly caught seafood, and home-made pastas, dishes don flavorful sauces that compliment each ingredient perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further accentuating the spirit of the carte du jour is the constantly changing and extensive wine list featuring both American and International selections with a focus on important small producers. To complete the unforgettable experience, an award winning 33 Cocktail Menu tempts all from the suit-clad after work crowd to the late night bar and dining scene.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Neet to RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250287402000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1248979999000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour at 33 one of the trendiest bars in Boston</name><id>10995223</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250114400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10995223/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/global_6726124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
