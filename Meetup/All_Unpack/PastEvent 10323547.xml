Not only are there different brands but also different flavors. Besides original, most are available in vanilla and chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many types, brands and flavors it can certainly be overwhelming. If you’ve been wanting to give these a try, come on over to my house on May 23rd for a tasting!  There will be a variety of purchased and home made raw nut milks to try.  I recently found out the nut milks are super easy to make!  I’ll have coffee, tea and some sweet treats (including raw, flourless) if you’d like test your favorite up to them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rsvp by May 22nd, so I know how much to buy and make!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Mangus</member_name><member_id>8074795</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244924004000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Vegans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-516</urlname><id>1286801</id><group_lat>42.4300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Vegan Metro West Network</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241322230000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Non-Dairy Milk Tasting</name><id>10323547</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243119600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-516/events/10323547/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/1/global_7118529.jpeg</photo_url></item>
