The majority of the world is not aware this is happening. The focus of the Social Action Campaign for The Cove  is to create worldwide awareness of this annual practice as well as the dangers of eating seafood contaminated with mercury and to pressure those in power to put an end to the slaughter.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And itâ€™s been working! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/3068998/the_cove_movie_trailer/" target="_blank"&gt;click here to view the trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
