The book we will be reading is &amp;quot;Letters From The Earth&amp;quot; by Mark Twain. Lots of copies are available in Connecticut public libraries as well as in book stores and online. An unabridged audio book is also available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1615341099/humanistassoc-20" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.amazon.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book consists of a series of short stories, many of which deal with God and Christianity. The title story consists of letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels, Gabriel and Michael, about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. Other short stories in the book include a bedtime story about a family of cats Twain wrote for his daughters, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note on upcoming books and events&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be gathering on &lt;b&gt;April 24&lt;/b&gt; to view one of the film adaptations of &lt;b&gt;Mark Twain's &amp;quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; and you may want to also read the book. We will meet at USNH, 700 Hartford Turnpike in Hamden. There will be a pot luck at 1:30 PM and we will start the film at 2:15 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you want to plan ahead or read the books in advance, future books we expect to be discussing are &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Justice&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; by Michael J. Sandel and &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Paul Robeson: A Biography&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; by Martin Bauml Duberman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note on updates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the latest information on this Meetup as well as our other events, sign up for the HAC Announcements list.
