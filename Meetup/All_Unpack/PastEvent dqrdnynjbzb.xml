I am glad to see that we have had lots of people participating in our meet ups and everyone seems to be having a blast! The next meet up will be held on March 20th from 1:00 - 3:00pm. Whether permitting, we can either have the meet up inside or outside. Hope to see everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - If you would like your dog groomed after them meet up let me know prior to the 17th and we can schedule an appointment with a 25% off discount. If you have any questions give me a call or send me an email.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask anyone at the front desk!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Best Friends Boxford</member_name><member_id>3881352</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276971726000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Active Dog Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Greater-Boston-Active-Small-Dog-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1444277</id><group_lat>42.6699981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Active Small Dog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270827197000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Active Small Dog Meetup Group Monthly Meetup</name><id>dqrdnynjbzb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276966800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Greater-Boston-Active-Small-Dog-Meetup-Group/events/13134913/</event_url></item>
