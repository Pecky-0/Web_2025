Experience some memorable pubs, rustic/cool restaurants and meet new people!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://www.dollarmouse.com" target="_blank"&gt;DollarMouse.com&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for one (or all) of these pub crawls.  &lt;br /&gt;* (non-alcoholic drinks)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>See Hostess/See Sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gregory DerBogosian</member_name><member_id>12639635</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326594528000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289865235000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pub Crawl - Sponsored by Dollar Mouse!
