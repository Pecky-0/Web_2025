We are going to schedule a meetup for a board game night tomorrow night in my neck of the neighborhood.  Now i know i have a couple board games but not too many so this is dependent on some people bringing some games out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not, I'll have a backup plan and if there's not enough interest, then let me just remind you all to come check out our show Saturday night and we can all hang out afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the confusion this week, things kinda piled up and I still wanted to try and have some sort of meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested please RSVP and comment on what game you'll bring if any. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meetup right outside the Northeastern University Green Line T Stop.  That's on the E line btw.  Just look across the street to the big glass faced building and we'll be outside.  If you get lost or need any other directions let me know.  Late comers feel free to give me a call on the phone number above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some parking on Huntington Ave., Forsyth St., Parker St., and Columbus Ave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason J.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a hat as usual, lol.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>3307420</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222644792000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Improv &amp; Performance Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cambridge-improv-incubator</urlname><id>472156</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Improv incubator</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222374525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Incubating a Board Game Night!!!</name><id>8833238</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222471800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cambridge-improv-incubator/events/8833238/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/c/0/global_3414704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
