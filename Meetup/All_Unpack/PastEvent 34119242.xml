&lt;p&gt;FIRST WWNO this Friday 9/23 8pm at Cuvee in WeHa Center&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were toying with a Wingwomen Night out for the gals at one of the Tuesday Starbucks meetups. John was there and he seemed cool with the idea.&amp;nbsp;Not that we don't love our Wingmen...but sometimes the gals just need to let loose with other gals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if anyone is interested in doing this, I was thinking we should do our first WWNO (wingwomen night out) in West Hartford Center. Maybe start at 8pm with a little loungey Cuvee action so we get plenty of time to compliment each other on&amp;nbsp;shoes and outfits...then move onto Barcelona or Elbow Room deck depending on the group's desire and the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the fellow wingmen just "happen" to show up for some of the festivities...we sure won't mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Organizer's cell phone # will be emailed out to YES rsvps day of or day before.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandra</member_name><member_id>2587310</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316961147000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Socialites</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialitesofconnecticut</urlname><id>1063500</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8700027466</group_lon><name>The Socialites of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1316448541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FRIDAY 9/23: First WWNO WingWomen Night out</name><id>34119242</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1316822400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialitesofconnecticut/events/34119242/</event_url></item>
