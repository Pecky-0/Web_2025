Their shows are always a fun night of music and dancing. If you want to check them out, go to their homepage: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.the-nerds.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Nerds Homepage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep an eye out for &amp;quot;Free before 10 pm&amp;quot; coupons in the mail or around New Haven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show starts at 9 and it looks like there are three opening bands before The Nerds start to play. I'll probably get to Toads a few minutes before 10 and will be in the back bar (the one with the jungle theme) until The Nerds start playing around midnight. Then I'll be on the dance floor! I will either put my cell # in my RSVP or email it to the YESs and MAYBEs before the show. Once The Nerds start playing, I may not be able to hear my cell phone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.toadsplace.com/calendar.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Toad's Place website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I (Andrea) will be in the back bar from 10 pm until The Nerds start to play.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>9</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223332900000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1222387959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Nerds play at Toads Place - Friday October 3rd</name><id>8834911</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223085600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/8834911/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/global_3516057.jpeg</photo_url></item>
