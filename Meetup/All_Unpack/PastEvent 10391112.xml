I am sure it is going to be really interesting! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is a little on the short notice, but I hope many of you can stop by the art sale. I unfortunately cannot make it this time. I have guests from home and we are going to be on the road on Thursday! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all soon, however! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care - bis bald, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hanna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hanna</member_name><member_id>3913437</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1243638344000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Language &amp; Culture Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>language-63</urlname><id>531356</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence German Language Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242095952000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art Sale by Carolina Arentsen! - “Pre-Internet Artwork” Trunk Sale.</name><id>10391112</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1242331200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/language-63/events/10391112/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/4/global_1943460.jpeg</photo_url></item>
