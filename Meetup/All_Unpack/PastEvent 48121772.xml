<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned this on Facebook, but wanted to share with meetup.com folks. Most of us complete at least 5K when we run, right? Why not make your Monday's run extra special by running as part of a group of people all over the world who have pledged to run 5K on Martin Luther King Day and donate to a charity of their choice? You just post your time and charity on the group's Facebook page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/249855968408076/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to run as a group, the two options are the lululemon run (gather 5:45 PM at the Pru, see event details on the calendar), OR, if people are interested, I'm willing to supervise a group of runners along RaceMenu's Miss Santa Holiday 5K course on the Esplanade at 10 AM Monday morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you RSVP, please indicate if you'd like to do it on your own, at lululemon, or on the Esplanade and we'll take it from there. Thanks, guys!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1326730598000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326581614000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Virtual 5K Run for Peace and Freedom, Monday, 1-16-12 (MLK Day)</name><id>48121772</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1326726000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/48121772/</event_url></item>
