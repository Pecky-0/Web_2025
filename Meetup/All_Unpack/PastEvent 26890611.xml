&lt;em&gt;The Tree&lt;/em&gt; is based on Judy Pascoe's novel, 
&lt;em&gt;Our Father Who Art in a Tree&lt;/em&gt;, a book I read and loved. It's been a while since I read the book, but I would still like to see how the narrative fares on the silver screen. With Charlotte Gainsbourg, the movie can't go wrong, and many reviewers say that the daughter (Morgana Davies) steals the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about 
&lt;em&gt;The Tree&lt;/em&gt; at the theater's website: 
&lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheaters.com"&gt;http://www.landmarktheaters.com&lt;/a&gt;. If you click on the link for "Boston" on the left, then scroll down on the right to find the movie, you will also find a link for the movie's official website, where you can also find the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;Selected as the Closing Night Film at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2010, 
  &lt;em&gt;The Tree&lt;/em&gt; is a mystical drama of loss and rebirth in the Australian countryside. . . . Blindsided with anguish after her husband's sudden death, Dawn (Gainsbourg)--along with her four young children--struggles to make sense of life without him. Eight-year-old Simone (unforgettable newcomer Morgana Davies) becomes convinced that her father is whispering to her through the leaves of the gargantuan fig tree that towers over their house. The family is initially comforted by its presence, but then the tree's enormous roots slowly begin to encroach on the abode and threaten their fragile existence . . . .*****&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will purchase my ticket at 6:30 p.m., then wait at the foot of the stairs in the theater lobby for about 15 or 20 minutes. I'll head into the theater auditorium at about 6:50. You can find me there if you are late. 
&lt;strong&gt;The movie starts at 7:05 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP if you plan to attend this event. My events tend to be small, and it is disconcerting when someone shows up unannounced, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
