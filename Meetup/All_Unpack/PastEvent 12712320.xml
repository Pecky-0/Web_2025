For those of you who missed out, last summer we met twice a week at the track to train for a 5K event.  We had walkers join us and cheer us on and runners who gave us inspiration (as they continued to lap us!).  After months of meeting at the track, I met some great people and made some wonderful friendships in my quest to finish my first 5K.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking get in some time to walk, want to train with us, or are runner of your own, please join us every and any Monday and Wednesday night at BHS.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get everyone ready for a 5K, event we will be posting training events using the &amp;quot;Couch to 5K&amp;quot; training schedule.  When more options are available, I will find some 5K events to post on the calendar for our &amp;quot;final exam&amp;quot;.  :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(we will be meeting twice a week for those who are training, so you SHOULD train the 3rd time on your own either on Friday or Saturday to keep with the schedule) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.coolrunnin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1 we are starting from scratch. Remember to bring your sneakers and some water!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couch to 5K, Week 1 Plan: (3x during the week) &lt;br /&gt;Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;Don't worry, I'll bring the stop watch with the whistle so everyone knows when to start and stop the jogging.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday, April 26th &lt;br /&gt;6:30pm  &lt;br /&gt;Braintree High School  &lt;br /&gt;Track  &lt;br /&gt;Meet at the entrance by the bleachers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizer(s): Julie &amp;amp; .....
