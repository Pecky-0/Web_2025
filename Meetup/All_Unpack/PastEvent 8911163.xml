Will we have a good idea by then of who will be winning?  Perhaps, perhaps not. What we should have is some pretty good information on how each candidate plans to deal with the housing crisis.  Let's have some interesting conversation on what is happening now, what we can look forward to in the coming months.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmest regards,&lt;br /&gt;Annie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come in and go down the stairs to our meeting room on the lower level.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1228175569000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223338115000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club November Meetup</name><id>8911163</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1225756800000</time><rsvp_limit>99</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/8911163/</event_url></item>
