From the summit, a clear day reveals views of Mt. Monadnock in New Hampshire, the Berkshires to the west, and the Boston skyline to the east. The Reservation's natural resources include forests, alpine meadows, ponds, streams, fields, and even a perched bog. The Reservation offers 17 miles of hiking and walking trails.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is snow on the trails, but only one of the trails is slippery and it is easily avoided. Most trails have a gradual incline.  The weather for Sunday looks cool, but sunny. Warm clothes and hiking boots should make for a nice day. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The drive is about 1hr 15min from Providence. We'll meet in the parking lot at the reservation headquarters &amp; visitors center. Look for my black Jetta.
