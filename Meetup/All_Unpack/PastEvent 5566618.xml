<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This week we will be focusing on the meditative asanas. These asanas maximize or channel energy through body positioning and mudras. There are over 30 meditative postures and we would like to experiment to see how they effect our yoga own practice. In addition, The Yoga Studio at FVPT has agreed to give all those that attend this meeting a one week unlimited yoga pass as a way to encourage people to come to this meet up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to bring flyers or announcements for other yoga or yoga related events in the area to this meeting. Also, bring ideas for future meeting topics; EVERYONE is invited to contribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see many of you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Mary&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1177193360000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1173825228000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Central CT Yoga Meetup</name><id>5566618</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1177020000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/5566618/</event_url></item>
