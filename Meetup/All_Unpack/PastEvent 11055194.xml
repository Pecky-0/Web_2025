Do you tango? I don't but I love to watch. I just talked to Vickie the president of the Tango Society of Boston and she is setting-up a little picnic at 6:30 PM. The Tango lessons and demonstration start around 7:30 PM and it's all free. This is her way to give back to the community! (of course you will have to bring your picnic basket)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know if you are like me but I love to seat outside and have a slice of cheese and a good glass of wine..shhhh. Anyway I think that it would make a nice setting for a meet-up and a good way to meet all the new and not so new members. the weatherman says it'll be nice and it is a very awesome spot at the Charles river!  What do you think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    SAT, August 8 (Rain date Sun, August 9)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tango by Moonlight 13th Season&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time:  7:30 pm - 11 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  Weeks Memorial Footbridge, Memorial Dr &amp;amp; DeWolfe St, Harvard Sq&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the light of the full moon shimmering over the rippling waters of the Charles River&lt;br /&gt; … join us to dance the Argentine Tango, or just to watch and listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 7:30 pm till about 11 pm, or until the moonlight and inspiration wanes … FREE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Weeks Pedestrian Bridge near Harvard Square (at Memorial Drive, just East of JFK Street, &lt;br /&gt;and across from Dewolfe Street).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impromptu 15-minute mini-lessons and demos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 617 721-4872 or 617 413-2981&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Vicky@bostontango.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Clifton@bostontango.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    www.bostontango.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    www.bostontangofestival.com/home.htm&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's be in touch.
