I'm a little cautious about him as an author (some questions exist regarding whether he actually interviews the people he quotes, and if he's ever visited some of the places he claims to have &amp;quot;investigated&amp;quot;) and he's not the most readable author on the topic of New England ghosts, but he seems particularly adept at finding these places and listing them for us.  He seems to &amp;quot;compile&amp;quot; more than he writes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm probably going to decide whether or not I'm going myself at the last minute, but I suspect I will because D'Agostino may have a lot of stuff in his head that we as a group would find very interesting.
