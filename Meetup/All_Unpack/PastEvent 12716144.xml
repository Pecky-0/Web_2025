Since this is last minute and I have no clue as to what numbers this entails, and I don't want to overwhelm the place, we are limiting the total to 15. Zander was kind enough to grab a reservation for 10-15. That being said, if you aren't able to RSVP onto this list, you can still go. We may not be all seated together but as long as you can see the game, that's the key.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there will be no maybe RSVPs. &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;If you RSVP make sure you plan to attend.&lt;/span&gt;  Ask for Alex's name at the door, Canadian meetup group if you're on the list as the reservations are under his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Canada go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Small Canadian flag</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bruce Turnbull</member_name><member_id>4018534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267405346000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267200375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canada v Slovakia</name><id>12716144</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267232400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/12716144/</event_url></item>
