We will start the group by listening to a talk by Richard Shankman on the Samadhi, which is the Buddhist term for the height of divine consciousness. Richard Shankman has been a meditator since 1970 and teaches at dharma centers and groups throughout the Bay Area. He is a co-founder of the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies and the Community Partnership for Mindfulness in Education, and the author of The Experience of Samadhi: An In-Depth Investigation of Buddhist Meditation. This is the first in a two part series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included will be a discussion about the talk, a short meditation, and a time to set intentions for the coming week. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274137811000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273530919000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Richard Shankman - Don't worry, be happy.</name><id>qmmdnynhbwb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274133600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/13442642/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
