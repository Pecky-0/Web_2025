Something that can also help you find a match between you and another person, bring about an experience of mutual comfort?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you wanted to know how to know your future and past and then effect the outcome?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you want to learn and master Energy Scaling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more go to &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.healingwithouteffort.com/blog.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.healingwit...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Energy Scaling is a methodology for “tuning into the same wavelength” as other people, situations or your own emotions to find out what is truly going on and create change harmoniously. It is based on the fact that the human energy system has a built-in resonance-based mechanism to deal with complex situations. If we learn to tune in to our innate ability for energetic scaling then we can stop worrying about what we need to do in a particular situation and allow our energy field to do what it knows how to do naturally - to go directly to find a “matching wavelength” in any given situation. Through scaling you will learn to make deeper connections to people and to your own emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can you get from learning this method?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * Scaling can help you identify problems in a relationship. It can also help you find a match between you and another person, bringing about an experience of mutual comfort.&lt;br /&gt;    * Energy Scaling can be used for getting in touch and healing internal emotional states as well as states of physical discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;    * Energy scaling is not limited to real time interactions. Distant scaling can be carried out equally well with a person who is absent.&lt;br /&gt;    * Scaling can be used to tune into situations. It enables you to handle a situation that is ongoing, as well as a situation that has not happened yet - to preempt potentially problematic encounters that could happen in the future.&lt;br /&gt;    * Energy Scaling has many far reaching benefits. It can enable you to improve your relationships with family members, avoid conflicts in a work environment, and bring meaning and a sense of ease to dating situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yuliya Cohen</member_name><member_id>6311859</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291480311000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>People on a healing journey</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma</urlname><id>1373363</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Freedom from Fear/ Anxiety /Emotional Trauma Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290662597000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Energetic Scaling: Weekend Intensive </name><id>15553174</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291474800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma/events/15553174/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/e/7/global_19858327.jpeg</photo_url></item>
