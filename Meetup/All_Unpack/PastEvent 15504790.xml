For those of you new to Boston, the Frog Pond is a holiday tradition. Its located outdoors in the Public Garden near Park Street Station. White lights on trees, holiday music, and cocoa...a perfect place for a December event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're using this event as a fundraiser for this amazing organization, On the Rise in Cambridge (www.ontherise.org). Its a day shelter and advocacy center for homeless women. The goal of this event is to raise money for a formerly homeless woman, purchasing items off her wish list to furnish her new apartment. Examples of what they ask for are: a lamp, pots and pans, rugs, towels, a microwave, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We obtained 20 VIP tickets at discount price ($20 value) and are requesting that every attendee donate a minimum of $15, payable at the event via check or cash. The VIP tickets include one skating pass, a skate rental, one hot cocoa, and VIP entrance (no waiting in line). All funds collected over the cost of the tickets will go directly to On the Rise in the form of the donated wish list items. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Note: Any BA members that choose to attend over the first 20 to RSVP must buy their tickets seperately at the Frog Pond. Regular tickets plus rentals run around 8-10 dollars. For those buying their own tickets, we will welcome any donation amount. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAIN DATE Saturday December 18, 5 pm&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet right near the ticket booth outside the rink.
