No idea how popular this will be, but the theater only holds 330ish people.  Please RSVP so I can judge how many people to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is I think 45 minutes long, and then we'll fill out a survey. After the film we can grab a drink and/or a bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Nerd Fun meetup, as well as my first time organizing anything for Nerd Fun. It will be great to meet everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DETAILS: The Museum of Science is considering an IMAX film for the Mugar Omni Theater, and&lt;br /&gt;we want your opinion! You are invited to attend a survey screening for Sea Rex: Journey to a Prehistoric World. The screening is free; your only obligation is to complete a short survey at the conclusion of the film. Tickets available in the Museum lobby starting at 7:30 p.m. on the night of the screening (July 27), first come, first served: &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/9p6eq0" target="_blank"&gt;http://bit.ly/9p6eq0...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Matt</member_name><member_id>12051404</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280358781000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279812680000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sea Rex: Journey to a Prehistoric World (Free movie screening at MoS)</name><id>14180238</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280269800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/14180238/</event_url></item>
