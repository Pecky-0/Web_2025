Afterwards we'll have the option to do a little sunset shooting at the Great Marsh or Crane Beach.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castle Hill is home to a wide diversity of wildlife typical of northeast Massachusetts forests. Deer, fox, turkey, and a multitude of songbirds can be observed from the many trails and roads on Castle Hill. In addition, Castle Hill is home to several pairs of nesting great horned owls and red-tailed hawks. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent Crane Beach, unusual species such as turkey vultures, migratory hawks, and even an occasional bald eagle can be seen soaring above the landscape.  Castle Hill is also a link in the &lt;a href="http://www.baycircuit.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Bay Circuit Trail&lt;/a&gt;, offering four miles of moderate hiking trails and roads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grounds immediately surrounding the Great House may be closed during an event. If that should happen, our focus will change to the trails around Crane Beach and Wildlife Refuge.  Notice of event changes are posted here, and an e-mail will be sent to the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEETING PLACE:  Castle Hill parking lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DATE/TIME:  Sunday, November 18th at 1:30PM, Sunset will be around 4:20PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING FEE: $5/per car at Castle Hill, or $7/per car at Crane Beach (50% off after 3PM)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS (from the Crane Estate website):&lt;br /&gt;From Route 128 north (towards Gloucester), take exit 20A (Route 1A north) and follow for 8 miles to Ipswich.
