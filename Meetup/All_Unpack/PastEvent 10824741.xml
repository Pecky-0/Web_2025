It's free to participate, and all are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Registration is at Bru at 141 Orange Street in New Haven at 1pm, and the race begins at 2pm. You'll get specific directions for how to play at Bru. Feel free to form your team ahead of time or come and find a group at Bru. Once the event begins, you'll solve riddles, complete challenges and race through the city, working as a team to win and find the location of the Secret Cluefest Party (party is strictly for those age 21 and over). Also, the team deemed to have the best costumes, attitude, etc. will be awarded the Cluefest Spirit Cup. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get lost, have questions, etc., your NHC contact is J.R., who can be reached at 248-563-4557. Please note that once the race begins, J.R. may not be immediately available to take your call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on Cluefest, visit &lt;a href="http://www.cluefest.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.cluefest.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248200856000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247004179000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cluefest 7: Get Lost.
