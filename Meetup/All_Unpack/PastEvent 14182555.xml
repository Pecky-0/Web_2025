Among these disciples are two men competing for her heart: the witty, privileged Orestes (Oscar Isaac) and Davus (Max Minghella), Hypatia’s young slave, who is torn between his secret love for her and the freedom he knows can be his if he chooses to join the unstoppable surge of the Christians. In English, directed by Alejandro Amenábar (The Sea Inside).      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://tickets.landmarktheatres.com/ticketing.aspx?theatreid=231&amp;amp;utm_medium=et_email&amp;amp;utm_content=ritka2%40hotmail.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=july-22-2010_072310+boston+weeklyfc&amp;amp;utm_source=072310+boston+weeklyfc" target="_blank"&gt;https://tickets.landm...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please Buy Your Own Tickets&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet by the concession stand inside the cinema. &lt;br /&gt;We'll go grab a drink at one of the Kendall Square establishments and hopefully have a good discussion following the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to meeting new people and seeing familiar faces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rita&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rita Kraner</member_name><member_id>3033713</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280362432000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Practical-Philosophy-Application-of-Timeless-Wisdom</urlname><id>1304986</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Practical Philosophy -- Application of Timeless Wisdom</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279825357000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MOVIE AT KENDALL CINEMA: "AGORA" re: GREEK FEMALE PHILOSOPHER/ASTRONOMER HYPATIA</name><id>14182555</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280273400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Practical-Philosophy-Application-of-Timeless-Wisdom/events/14182555/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/a/9/global_16625545.jpeg</photo_url></item>
