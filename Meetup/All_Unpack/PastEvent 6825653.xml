We have a meeting scheduled for next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be giving a short (30min) talk on Rake and it's wonderfulness. Should mostly be an intro, but will be happy to cover any thing that I can about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey Rosenthal will be filling in the rest of the night, all though I am not sure what he will be covering. I'll try to post an update later today to fill in the details! Sorry about that, but I hope to see you all there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those interested I would like to try and continue the tradition of heading down to the restaurant down the hall to have a bit more 'light hearted' conversation over good food and beverages. All are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick Stuart</member_name><member_id>2436503</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1196982595000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ruby programmers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meruby</urlname><id>213431</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Portland Maine Ruby Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196360305000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meeting Next Week</name><id>6825653</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196809200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meruby/events/6825653/</event_url></item>
