This is one of the reasons I'm posting this event yet again. This park is wide open and just beautiful. The fresh air is good for my dogs and just as good for me. So its really just a casual invitation to come down and enjoy watching the dogs have some freedom from the everyday events.  As always bring water for yourself and your dog and toys if you want. Hope to see my 2 legged and 4 legged friends at the park&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;...WOOF.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be playing out in the fields.
