Especially since Pennington, who played 8 years with the Jets was cut like a hot potato right before the 2008 season started for Favre.   Favre who came out of retirement after playing with Greenbay since 1992.  Talk about jilted fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come on down to McFadden's that great fun place we've been trying to get to all season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Donation of $1.00 to organizer at beginning of event greatly appreciated to help cover Meet Up web costs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>5999051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232386329000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Funseeker</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>nefunseekers</urlname><id>1277691</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>Funseekers!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230567899000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AFC Wild Card Game  Baltimore vs. Miami</name><id>9401664</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231090200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nefunseekers/events/9401664/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/8/8/global_6765976.jpeg</photo_url></item>
