Climbing at QQ is free. We need ropes, so if you have them, bring them! We'll set up ropes on routes covering a range of different difficulties, so climbers of all skill levels are welcome. There is free parking available, and reasonably easy access from the MBTA. Those who don't have cars can take the Red Line to Quincy Center and call me ahead of time at 508-280-9041 to arrange a pick up, or take the 215 bus from Quincy Center to Willard Street. Walk south on Willard Street for a few hundred meters following the traffic under Rt. 93 till you reach Ricciuti Dr, then walk up Ricciuti Dr. to the first parking lot on the right.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rudy Breteler</member_name><member_id>46824442</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1336917197000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Rock-Climbers</urlname><id>1496386</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>South Shore Rock Climbers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1336508534000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climb Quincy Quarries</name><id>63965582</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1336831200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Rock-Climbers/events/63965582/</event_url></item>
