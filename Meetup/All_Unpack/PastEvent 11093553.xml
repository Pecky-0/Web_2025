The hike is 10.4 miles in length if we only go to Pierce - 12.1 if we include Eisenhower. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Webster Cliff trail is rocky, steep, and has open ledges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal will be to maintain booktime which would put us on the summit of Pierce in under 6 hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody considering this hike should be confident in their abilities and endurance, understand the principles in HikeSafe.
