<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is the first monthly meeting of the Portland Maine Oil Awareness group. We plan to view the DVD &amp;quot;The End of Suburbia&amp;quot;, discuss the pros and cons of being an official dues-paying Meetup group, and get to know each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that since I am now the official Organizer, I'm taking on the $19/month fee for this month. Since it was only my decision and not a consensus, I'm not formally requiring an event fee for you to attend. However, if you could voluntarily contribute a few bucks to help me defray that charge, that would be great! We'll talk about whether to continue that or not.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Advocates for Oil Awareness</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-169</urlname><id>113465</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1125313318000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Portland Oil Awareness September Meetup</name><id>4756125</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1126911600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-169/events/4756125/</event_url></item>
