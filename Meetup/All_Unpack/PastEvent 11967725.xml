I'll plot a 1.5-2 hour loop in either the Natchaug or the Goodwin State Forest. Because it may be icy we'll keep to smooth trails. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will muster at my place, like last time and carpool to the trailhead. Wear good hiking shoes with soles that will work with the weather (particularly if we have snow or ice). I'll bring a thermos flask of tea for the trail. Please arrive at my place no later than 1.15. We will be leaving punctually so we have enough light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's snowing (or any kind of light precipitation) we'll probably still go. Swinish, heavy rain or very heavy snow will mean postponement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Victoria Northrop</member_name><member_id>8657197</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261419408000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330452</id><group_lat>41.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2099990845</group_lon><name>The NorthEast Connecticut Friends Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259425981000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Solstice Hike</name><id>11967725</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261245600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-NorthEast-Connecticut-Friends-Meetup-Group/events/11967725/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/c/global_6487468.jpeg</photo_url></item>
