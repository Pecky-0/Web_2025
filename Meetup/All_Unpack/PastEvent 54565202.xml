<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This large park has lots of open grassy areas, paved paths, and one side of it is the north shore of the Mystic River. It's a lovely place to walk along the paths on a leash, or to run and chase birds and even an occasional rabbit. The parking lot is on Rte 16, near Wellington Circle, Medford. We had a meetup here August 8 2010 which you can read about and see pictures of on this site. (The pictures were all taken in the parking lot. so you don't see the park itself.) There is no obvious sign for the park visible from the road, so if you're at Wellington Circle, watch for the State Police barracks; the entrance to the parking lot is right next to that. As usual, if you get lost, call us! (617-803-4530) Heavy snow or icy conditions will cancel this meetup with no rain date; but if there's a heavy rain that Saturday, we will postpone the meetup to next day, Sunday. Cold weather will not affect things, except we'll have to dress accordingly. I will bring hand-warmers for everyone who RSVPs, just in case we need them.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karla Rab</member_name><member_id>10717717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332986922000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330640937000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>celebrate Spring together romping around in Macdonald Park, Medford!</name><id>54565202</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332599400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/54565202/</event_url></item>
