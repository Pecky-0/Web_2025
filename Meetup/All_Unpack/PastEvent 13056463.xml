In an interview about music and censorship for the Web site freemuse.org, Rodriguez-Seeger said, &amp;quot;Nobody's going to sit around for three hours and listen to a musician if they're not entertaining.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodriguez-Seeger put out four albums with his band The Mammals, and has played with Sarah Lee Guthrie, Woody Guthrie's granddaughter, in the group RIG. Backed by a gospel choir (and the Lincoln Memorial), he played Woody Guthrie's &amp;quot;This Land Is Your Land&amp;quot; with Bruce Springsteen and Pete Seeger at President Obama's inaugural celebration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tao will be backed by Jake Silver on bass, Walter Morciglio on guitar and Zeke Hutchins on drums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$15 at the door; $12 if reservation is made at least 24 hours in advance, UCG members and seniors; $10 students with ID.
