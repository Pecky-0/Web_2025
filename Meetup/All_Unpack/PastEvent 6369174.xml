Because Betsi is still setting up her home-based business and because we've got more people interested than her place can comfortably hold, we agreed to look for another venue this time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NEW VENUE: The Stamp Act is a great three-year-old rubber-stamp and craft store on Route 3A in Marshfield.  [Web site: www.thestampactstore.com]. The store has a BIG, beautiful, airy craft room with tables that will easily accommodate a dozen or more of us, even with all our stuff. The room has its own door right off the parking lot, so it's E-Z in, E-Z out (you don't have to haul your stuff through the store itself), and it's got its own restroom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visited the store recently and met Marie, the owner. She's really nice and a big ATC fan; in fact, she's good friends with ATC maven Bernie Berlin. Marie really knows her stuff--some of her work is featured in a rubber-stamp book I've been reading, and she's happy to demonstrate techniques on request. And the store itself is charming--lots of unusual stuff, lots of examples (including ATCs) on display.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST/LUNCH: Cost per person to use the room is $5 for the whole day. There are places nearby where we can get takeout, but I don't have details yet -- so if you're on a special diet, you may want to bring your own lunch or snacks, just in case.  As always, I'll accept donations to defray the cost of our Web site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRAVEL/DIRECTIONS. The Stamp Act is easy to find. It's on Route 3A (a main drag), about 3 miles off Route 3 (exit 12). I suggest doing a Mapquest or Google Map using the address below. It's in a big old house with a sign out front (picture on Web site). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a long haul for some people, especially those north or west of Boston, so you might want to start a carpooling thread on the message board. Those coming from Providence or other points southwest might want to look at options involving I-495 and possibly Route 44. But wherever you're coming from, I promise that you'll find the store worth the trip -- and I'm sure our day together will be worth it, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, we can now accommodate everyone who wants to attend and then some. Please update your RSVPs, if necessary. And let me know if you have questions. I'm very much looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200328287000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189955392000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Hands-On ATC+ Meetup UPDATE: New location!</name><id>6369174</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192888800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/6369174/</event_url></item>
