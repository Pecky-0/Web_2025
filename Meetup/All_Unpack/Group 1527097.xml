&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rhode Island Hiking Club " Walks &amp;amp; Rambles "offer's a variety of hikes from the beginner to the more experienced .We tend to engage in rather challenging hikes often through rough terrain. The purpose of this meetup is to get physically capable people together who want to get out and enjoy the beauty of some of RI's nicest places on foot. This Meetup is for people who enjoy a hike that leaves them satisfied in both the physical level of exertion, the enjoyment of the outdoors, and all the refreshment a hike has to offer the body and mind.  This Meetup provides an opportunity to enjoy nature in the company of other adults without the distraction of cellphones, kids, and/or dogs.  If you are someone that likes to push yourself physically beyond a pleasant stroll and are at a decent level of physical fitness, then this could be a fun and rewarding Meetup for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On  11/11/2011,  I became the groups fourth Organizer . I hope to continue and expand the group as we move into the new year .By keeping  with the groups original   format . We are a hiking group based on the book  ( Weekend Walks in Rhode Island by Ken Weber ).  Thanks to Michael the clubs founder for starting this group. My goal is offer more people like yourselves the opportunity to experience what this little state has to offer and our surrounding neighbors  Connecticut and Massachusetts and with occasional hikes to New Hampshire .  Most people have no idea what is right in there back yard . My intent is to show them . We offer good exercise , good company and short travel all at  no charge .What else could you ask for .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the winter months we will continue hiking through the season along will more activities such as snow shoeing and cross country skiing , possibly .( Volunteers needed ). I would like to add a few more hikes into Connecticut along with more  long distance trails , The Narragansett  Trail, 26 miles which starts in Connecticut and actually ends in R.I and the Nipmuck Trail in Conn ,34 miles .  Nipmuck does offer some camping on the trail as well .These hikes would be done in Spring and need to be well planned . We will always have  John N and the North South Trial in R.I . to also keep us busy .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When  the Summer months approach we will continue to hike either evenings or early mornings .I hope to have biking and kayaking stay in the mix  . There will be  more  updates as we go along  and I am sure more mistakes  that I will make .We also will need more organizer’s to do this and I cant stress this enough . With your help we can make a good club a great one .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See you soon ,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following write up is from when Walks &amp;amp; Rambles first started in September of 2009.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will plan hikes on a weekly basis for Saturday mornings, many Sundays as well, with some after work "walks" as well during the longer daylight days of summer.  Weather in RI is always a factor so there's a good chance we won't meet every Saturday.  Heavy rain will cancel a hike as will as a particularly hot and humid day in the summer, but most other conditions are suitable for a decent time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The laundry and cleaning can wait till you get home. Put yourself first, make some friends, have some fun and improve your outlook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #12291b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:  I left the original name Walks and Rambles in the write up  as a tribute to Ken Weber,  and Michael,  who had the foresight to start this Club back in Sept. 2009.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><rating>4.88</rating><join_mode>open</join_mode><created>1253495437000</created><lat>41.7000007629</lat><visibility>public</visibility><topics><topics_item><id>579</id><urlkey>bike</urlkey><name>Bicycling</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>638</id><urlkey>hiking</urlkey><name>Hiking</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15046</id><urlkey>outdoors</urlkey><name>Outdoors</name></topics_item><topics_item><id>15893</id><urlkey>walking-for-fitness</urlkey><name>Walking for Fitness</name></topics_item></topics><name>Rhode Island Hiking Club        " Walks and Rambles "</name><id>1527097</id><members>1885</members><country>US</country><organizer><member_id>12464984</member_id><name>Tony Chernasky</name></organizer><urlname>RhodeIslandhikingclub</urlname><group_photo><photo_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/e/6/600_94242982.jpeg</photo_link><highres_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/e/6/highres_94242982.jpeg</highres_link><photo_id>94242982</photo_id><thumb_link>http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/e/6/thumb_94242982.jpeg</thumb_link></group_photo><timezone>US/Eastern</timezone><city>Warwick</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/RhodeIslandhikingclub/</link><lon>-71.4400024414</lon></item>
