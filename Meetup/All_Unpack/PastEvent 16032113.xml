After which he'll go look at open listings at &amp;quot;The Apartment&amp;quot; (373 Richmond st.) and finish off with some ribs at &amp;quot;Ricks Roadhouse&amp;quot; (370 Richmond st).  Great set list for a cold evening as each place is only a few steps from one another.  The plan is 2 hours at each stop, but if you're late and the group isn't at at one, they'll be at the next/previous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're new to the Doc's events, this isn't your monday happy hour ... this is late nite shenanigans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is adequate parking in the area, but if you plan to participate in the shenanigans, plan for bumming a ride or taxi home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-it's time for some friday night medicine...&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Doc wears his sunglasses at night</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doc LateNite</member_name><member_id>9585499</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295289967000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1294894132000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>A spoon full of LateNite helps the Medicine go down</name><id>16032113</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295053200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/16032113/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/b/global_5889099.jpeg</photo_url></item>
