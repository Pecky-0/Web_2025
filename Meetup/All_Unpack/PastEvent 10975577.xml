As your team gathers answers about the art, you begin to piece together a sordid tale about greed, lust, pride, revenge and treachery, all revolving around the museum’s planned multi-million-dollar purchase of a long-lost painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. The murder victim knew too much—and now it’s up to you to learn what he knew and discover what drove one of four suspects to commit murder. To find out, you’ll have to crack a secret code left in the victim’s appointment calendar. Can you figure out who dunnit?&lt;br /&gt;Later, we'll celebrate our victory at BOND!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Admission:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$29.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Address:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Boston&lt;br /&gt;Avenue of the Arts&lt;br /&gt;465 Huntington Avenue&lt;br /&gt;Avenue of the Arts&lt;br /&gt;Boston, Massachusetts 02115-5523&lt;br /&gt;617-267-9300&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public Transportation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subway:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because our limited parking fills up quickly--especially during popular exhibitions--we encourage you to take advantage of the MBTA, Boston's public transportation system (known by natives as the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the Green Line &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; train to the &amp;quot;Museum of Fine Arts&amp;quot; stop, or the Orange Line train to the &amp;quot;Ruggles&amp;quot; stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fare for the T begins at $1.70 for adults. Pricing information and passes are available at subway stations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bus:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the 39 bus to the &amp;quot;Museum of Fine Arts&amp;quot; stop, or the 8, 47, or CT2 buses to the &amp;quot;Ruggles&amp;quot; stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Parking:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is available in the garage on Museum Road.
