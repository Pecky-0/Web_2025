We will meet at 1:00 and enjoy the grounds of our fellow member Beverly's Sculpture Garden.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dear Art Friends:&lt;br /&gt;On June 12th and 13th the annual Sculpture in the Garden show will be held at Beverly Kaye Gallery on Lorraine Drive in Woodbridge.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the bleak economy, the oil spill and the troubles in the Middle East, I am forging ahead and planning the 17th annual Sculpture in The Garden show. People need art, they need to see it, touch it, and experience it in a garden on a lovely day. So I have invited ten outstanding self-taught artists who use recycled materials to participate in this show. Out of junk yard finds, old car and truck parts, ancient tools, wire and stone, they have forged objects of desire and delight. There will be life sized horses standing side by side with musicians, rare birds, stone heads, robots, slate garden signs, and so much more. Prepare to be astonished, and bring the whole family. Free admission.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>easy to find</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cathy M</member_name><member_id>6563416</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1276477099000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Arts  lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Arts-Cultural-Events</urlname><id>1343414</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Arts &amp; Creative Cultural Events</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270224485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Annual Woodbridge Garden Sculpture Show</name><id>13068519</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276448400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Arts-Cultural-Events/events/13068519/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/6/0/global_15663936.jpeg</photo_url></item>
