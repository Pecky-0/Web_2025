Atheists are not the only ones who question the veracity of the Bible and whether Jesus was an actual person. Many scholars and theologians have concluded that convincing evidence that Jesus was a real person is missing. In fact there is ample evidence that he was entirely fictional, and his existence is strangely not mentioned in any surviving historical writings of the time. Do you harbor a belief one way or the other, perhaps lingering from a religious childhood? Does it really matter to Christianity whether he was real or not? In this meetup, we'll discuss who wrote the Bible, the authors of the Bible, and what was known about them...and the characters they wrote about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's an interesting article to get things started: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/marshall_gauvin/did_jesus_really_live.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/marshall_gauvin/did_jesus_really_live.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.infidels.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meeting will also include plenty of time to meet and socialize with atheist friends, new and old. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the large group, some might be wearing atheistic shirts</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul S</member_name><member_id>4811434</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Scott</member_name><member_id>5222022</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Valerie </member_name><member_id>7248057</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284980544000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Atheists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>lowellatheists</urlname><id>13032</id><group_lat>42.6300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3300018311</group_lon><name>Atheists of Greater Lowell</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272585658000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Morning Topical Meeting--Discussion of the Bible and Jesus</name><id>jqmnnynmbzb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284906600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/lowellatheists/events/14623148/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/2/global_10991506.jpeg</photo_url></item>
