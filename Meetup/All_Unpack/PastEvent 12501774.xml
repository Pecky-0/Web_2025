Lots of social activities are planned including a Friday night BYOB to get your weekend started.  Saturday and Sunday will have several apres ski events and other fun - more details after you RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday River Discount - Our race team will be at Sunday River which means that ANYONE staying at our house is eligible for the race discount.  Not sure on the cost but it should be between $45 and $50 for a ticket.  If you are interested in racing as a guest just let me know -  it is a modified slalom, easy turns, not to steep.  You do not have to race to get the discount at Sunday River.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that although couples are welcome all bedrooms are same sex only, most rooms are 2 bunkbeds.  If you are looking for a romantic Valentine weekend alone this is not the weekend to come up.  If you are looking to meet new people, ski and have fun - then come on up.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring sheets, blanket, pillow, towel.  21+ only.  reservations may close early if we reach our max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Darlene</member_name><member_id>7362850</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266192844000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Wedelns</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Wedelns</urlname><id>687583</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265158285000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wedeln House Weekend - Sunday River Discount and more</name><id>12501774</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266019200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Wedelns/events/12501774/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/8/7/global_4065975.jpeg</photo_url></item>
