Brandi (Mena Suvari) is a compassionate young retirement home caregiver in line for a promotion. Tom (Stephen Rea) is a victim of the downsized economy, out of work and newly homeless. Their worlds collide when Brandi, driving home from a club after too many drinks and pills, accidentally hits Tom, the impact smashing his body head-first through her car's windshield, where he remains lodged. If discovered, this &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; will extinguish her bright future, so instead of saving him, her plan is to let him die and dispose of the body later. Faced with this reality, Tom knows he must escape if he wants to survive. Co-starring Russell Hornsby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening in theaters: June 6, 2008&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chelsea</member_name><member_id>3861711</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214356137000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>See it before everyone else, FOR FREE!!</why><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212437822000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE ADVANCED SCREENING - STUCK</name><id>8063127</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1212620400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/8063127/</event_url></item>
