Â looks like old man winter is returning to kfit on sunday so we have decided to move this little hop to Saturday to beat the snow flakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please update your intentions on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will all meet at the FPA at 8:00 am Saturday, then head out to the planes, Depart KFIT at 8:30 (ish) for KBAF. pick up Bradley on 119.00 somewhere over Quabbin for radar services into KBAF. Eat, (non PIC pay for the PIC). From KBAF, we need a squawk to depart and we head to KORH for a couple touch and go's. From there back to KFIT for some debriefing. 3 airports, into delta airspace, contacting a few different ATC facilities. Good stuff, let's work this with them. By flying students or pilots who don't fly often, we can show them the FPA way. Fly, eat and have fun. I'll put the choices down as questions and lets see how many we can get to go! let's go flying!!!&lt;/p&gt;
