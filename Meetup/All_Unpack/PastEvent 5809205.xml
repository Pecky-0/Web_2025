<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;a href="http://www.bikesummer.org" target="_blank"&gt;BikeSummer&lt;/a&gt; rolls into New Haven this Friday with the big kickoff party following Critical Mass. Here's what you need to know: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Critical Mass ride meets at the usual time--5:30 p.m. at the flagpole on the New Haven Green. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The afterparty is being held behind The Devil's Gear Bike Shop. As always, BYOB and a dish or snack to share. The BikeSummer organizing committee will be manning the grills and providing burgers (meat and meatless!) dogs, rolls, chips and soft drinks. A small donation of $5.00 gets you a nifty BikeSummer pin and food from the grill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What about entertainment, you ask? Music will be provided by several local bands. So far, Mercy Meadows, Kalte Sterne and The Smyrk are on the bill, with others to be announced. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180302750000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179924549000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Critical Mass + Bike Summer Kickoff Party</name><id>5809205</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1180129500000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5809205/</event_url></item>
