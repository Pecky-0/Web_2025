We hike at a pace 50% slower than the AMC Trailguide book time. There are three other hiking Meetup groups if you want a faster pace or more challenging hikes (The New England Hiking Meetup, 4 Seasons Hiking Group, New England Over 40 Hiking Group). Our goal is to stay fit while enjoying the camaraderie of hikers who have similar skills and goals. This is a dog free hiking group.&lt;/p&gt;Trailhead:Take I93 north to exit 32,take Kancamagus Highway (NH112) east,just after passing Jigger Johnson Campground,make a left onto Bear Notch Road (not on all highway maps),parking lot for Attitash Trailhead on right.We will hike the Attitash Trail to the summit of Table Mountain (2675').Good views from open ledges. 3.8 miles round trip, 1350' elevation gain, AMC booktime 2.5 hours, 4 hours estimated time for our group.---Steve &amp;amp; Cindy---- Disclaimer: As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.
