<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next Vegan Meetup will be a make-your-own pizza party! We'll provide vegan pizza dough, sauce and shredded Daiya cheese (the first vegan cheese that actually melts!). We ask that you bring your favorite pizza topping to share with the group. Afterwards, we'll watch the award-winning documentary film Peaceable Kingdom (&lt;a href="http://www.peaceablekingdomfilm.org/)" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.peaceablek...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you think that you're likely to attend so that we can make sure that there are plenty of basic pizza ingredients for everyone. Right now, we are tentatively planning to hold the event at the Sustainable Living Center at Dartmouth College (which has a full kitchen with ovens, as well as a TV room). We'll keep you posted if the location changes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lola</member_name><member_id>915277</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297617073000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Pioneers of Peace</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>vegan-430</urlname><id>650201</id><group_lat>43.7099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-72.2699966431</group_lon><name>NH/VT Vegan Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295411546000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Make-Your-Own Vegan Pizza Party</name><id>16102714</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297465200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/vegan-430/events/16102714/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/global_1994793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
