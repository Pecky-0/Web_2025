Why it takes you time after time to work through projects or daily activities you know could be completed simply and efficiently? The dictionary defines sloth as idleness &amp;amp; diligence as persistent work. There is an art to getting things done, a peacefulness one has to carry to make manifest that which you want. Join Father Peter Bowes, Christian Master Teacher, musician, author in tonight’s seminar and come away with an understanding of what holds you back and what you can do to spring forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation $25 • Bring a Friend for Free! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes is an ordained Priest and Master Teacher in the Order of Christ/Sophia.
