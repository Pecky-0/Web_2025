But while it is fresh in our minds we are getting together to discuss each and every area to find ways to make it even better in 2011!   We need everyone that helped out with the fair - before, during or after - to come out and voice your thoughts and tell everyone what you saw going on at the fair.   Dinner is being provided by Burton's Grill, so bring your appetite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Upstairs in the Friends Room</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paul Petrillo</member_name><member_id>8764866</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286055576000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-South-Windsor-Jaycees</urlname><id>1368385</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>The South Windsor Jaycees</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284718514000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wapping Fair Wrap Up Meeting</name><id>14801551</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285196400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-South-Windsor-Jaycees/events/14801551/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/0/9/global_17824617.jpeg</photo_url></item>
