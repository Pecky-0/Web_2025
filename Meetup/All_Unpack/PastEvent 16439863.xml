Afterwards, you will have something tangible to work towards and as you achieve your dreams together, you can take the picture down and put something new up or just work towards a blank slate. I'll provide the supplies, but you need to bring your own magazines or pictures to put onto the board. Remember, it can be themed or just filled with everything you want. It's all up to you. I look foward to building and sharing our dreams together.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We are on the corner of LIberty and School Street.
