Halfway around is a gorgeous stone bridge that is perfect for a doggy photo shoot! The trail is (relatively) flat and smooth and is a very nice walk! Took me about 1.5 hours at a casual stroll. The trail ends about 0.5 miles from where it starts but is an easy walk back to the beginning on city streets. There is plenty of parking in the area. Leashed dogs are required and come prepared to scoop the poop!
