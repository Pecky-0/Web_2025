See you all then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Gone Away World&lt;/i&gt; by Nick Harkaway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unclassifiable debut from the son of legendary thriller author John le Carr√© is simultaneously a cautionary tale about the absurdity of war; a sardonic science fiction romp through Armageddon; a conspiracy-fueled mystery replete with ninjas, mimes and cannibal dogs; and a horrifying glimpse of a Lovecraftian near-future. Go Away bombs have erased entire sections of reality from the face of the Earth. A nameless soldier and his heroic best friend witness firsthand the unimaginable aftermath outside the Livable Zone, finding that the world has unraveled and is home to an assortment of nightmarish mutations. With the fate of humankind in the balance, the pair become involved in an unlikely and potentially catastrophic love triangle. Readers who prefer linear, conventional plotlines may find Harkaway overly verbose and frustratingly tangential, but those intrigued by works that blur genre boundaries will find this wildly original hybrid a challenging and entertaining entry in the post-apocalyptic canon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>George</member_name><member_id>6616482</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296749518000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>thatotherbookgroup</urlname><id>1149392</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2600021362</group_lon><name>That Other Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1276459884000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Gone-Away World</name><id>13788533</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296518400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/thatotherbookgroup/events/13788533/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/6/e/global_15688974.jpeg</photo_url></item>
