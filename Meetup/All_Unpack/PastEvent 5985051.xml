This is the biggest regularly scheduled event on our calendar. It's not uncommon to see 40 or more tall people here, and you won't be the only new or prospective member! This is the place to start your social calendar planning, arrange carpooling for various events, and find out what's going on with all your Tall friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Marriott Hotel, 2345 Commonwealth Avenue (Rt. 30) in Newton &lt;br /&gt;Time: 6-8 PM, usually dinner afterwards to 10pm &lt;br /&gt;Cost: optional drinks &lt;br /&gt;Directions: Rt. 128 to exit 24 (Rt. 30). At the end of the ramp, go right. The Marriott is just ahead on your left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/BOSNT" target="_blank"&gt;More on the Newton Marriott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186351832000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1183763515000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club August First Friday</name><id>5985051</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186178400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/5985051/</event_url></item>
