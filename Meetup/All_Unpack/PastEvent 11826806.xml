We'll meet at the Opera House in Newport and then go to Gas Lamp Grill after the movie for dinner and drinks.   &lt;br /&gt;This movie received very good reviews and I wanted to read the book, but never got around to it so this will have to do for now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Men Who Stare at Goats &lt;br /&gt;Struggling reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) gets the scoop of a lifetime when he meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), who claims to be from a unit of psychic soldiers who have been reactivated for duty. Intrigued by Cassady's assertions that they can walk through walls and kill goats by fixed gazes, Wilton follows him on a dangerous, top-secret mission across Iraq to find the brigade's founder, Bill Django (Jeff Bridges).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet near the bench in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Paula</member_name><member_id>5505578</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lonnie</member_name><member_id>6911660</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258069949000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newportfriends</urlname><id>429443</id><group_lat>41.4799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3099975586</group_lon><name>Newport Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257716567000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Goat Movie and Gas Lamp Grill Combo</name><id>11826806</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257896700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newportfriends/events/11826806/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/global_11706738.jpeg</photo_url></item>
