As Steppers we've been asked to &amp;quot;get the party started&amp;quot; when the dance floor opens up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event will include a light dinner menu, an awards ceremony, live band and a DJ. The dinner program will run between 7-8:30pm. Entertainment and dancing will continue afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BWA will be highlighting major victories, including the passage of historic CORI reforms,  green justice work, and the launch of the Boston Staffing Alliance, Massachusetts’ first CORI friendly temp agency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to those for volunteering to participate in the BWA Fundraiser. Gentleman Steven will have our $20 tickets available at the Den on 10/21/10. We'll be seated at a reserved table for 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This is an opportunity to step and network.  This is not a TOSOB event. Posted with permissions of BWA)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gentleman Scott</member_name><member_id>4548946</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey </member_name><member_id>5014779</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287853276000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Original Steppers of Boston</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Steppers-of-Boston</urlname><id>1340809</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Original Steppers of Boston Inc. 2006</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287448397000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Workers Alliance’s 2010 Celebration and Fundraiser</name><id>15153223</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287786600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Steppers-of-Boston/events/15153223/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/9/global_15984537.jpeg</photo_url></item>
