You have to pre-pay for the your ticket in order for them to hold it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since this is a Saturday night performance, perhaps we can plan to meet for dinner beforehand at a local eatery.  Please indicate in your RSVP if you'd like to join for dinner, and if so, add any suggestions you may have for nearby places to dine!  We can post that as a separate meetup listing later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play is Contact:&lt;br /&gt; The New England Regional Theatre Premiere!&lt;br /&gt;Winner Of 4 TonyÂ® Awards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact was the hit of the 2000 Broadway season and a big feather in director/choreographer Susan Stroman's cap.
