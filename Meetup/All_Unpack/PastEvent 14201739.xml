They want to go to Jamestown!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 10:00 AM at the Beavertail lighthouse (located as the southern tip of the island).  It's the really tall building in the picture on the event's meetup page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not *exactly* sure about where we'll be pedaling, but  &lt;a href="http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/Jamestown-Classic" target="_blank"&gt; we will probably take this route&lt;/a&gt;.  It will be roughly 20 miles of street riding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;We're going to be riding on roads NOT on dedicated bike paths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  Because of this I'm going to cap the size of this meetup and disallow maybes.  &lt;b&gt;PLEASE ONLY SIGN UP AS A YES IF YOU ARE PRETTY SURE YOU CAN ATTEND&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;I *highly suggest* that you bring a helmet&lt;/u&gt;, sunglasses and water with you on this ride.  You might also want to take a bit of cash with you, in case people want to stop somewhere afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be traveling around 11 miles per hour.  This is about our usual speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I get fewer than 5 YES RSVPs by Thursday night, I'll cancel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for us at the big lighthouse (at the very southern tip of the island) or try my cell (401) 699-7304</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280763411000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280005417000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Biking in Jamestown!!</name><id>14201739</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280584800000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/14201739/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/e/global_10593550.jpeg</photo_url></item>
