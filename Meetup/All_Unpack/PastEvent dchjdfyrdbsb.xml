It was a joyful discovery to realize that we reached a consensus about practically everything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these discussions, he gave her an autographed copy of his book, which she will display for others to view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, Jack Reed outlines a practical prescription which can be implemented to resolve the major social, economic, political, and environmental issues on planet now. He specifies details about how to set up loosely connected but totally independent "green" communities that really do work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also  has a website which anyone can join free, subscribing to his newsletters.  It is suggested that those living too far away to physically attend this meetup take a moment to check out  &lt;a href="http://www.communityplanet.org"&gt;www.communityplanet.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
