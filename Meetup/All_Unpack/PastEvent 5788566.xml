As at all our meetings, if you have a particular topic or corpus that's really been preoccupying you, you have the option of taking the floor and holding forth with a pocket lecture. Yes, we're just that accommodating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this would be your first time attending, please get in touch with me so I can cue you in as to what to expect. I'm always available to answer questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Zachary Bos</member_name><member_id>83909</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1180134647000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Poets</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonpoetry</urlname><id>122206</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Poetry</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1179417479000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Weekly Workshop</name><id>5788566</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179961200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpoetry/events/5788566/</event_url></item>
