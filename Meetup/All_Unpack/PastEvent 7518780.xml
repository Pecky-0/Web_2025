We'll start the movie when everyone has had a chance to settle in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South Africa's &amp;quot;Tsotsi&amp;quot; presents a harsh, gritty surface beneath which swims an ocean of sentiment. It's a solid, earnest drama of moral redemption that places old cliches in an unfamiliar setting, and if director Gavin Hood's insistence on our common humanity is both rousing and necessary, he's still dealing from a dramatically stacked deck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Tsotsi&amp;quot; is based on the only novel written by the South African playwright Athol Fugard (&amp;quot;Master Harold and the Boys&amp;quot;); belatedly published in 1980, it was written around 1960 as a cry of outrage over the spiritual costs of apartheid. The book's antihero was the hellish byproduct of a hellish system; the movie's Tsotsi, living in a vastly changed South Africa, is both more complicated and more simplistic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;                                &lt;br /&gt;The movie is free.&lt;br /&gt;Donations are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205710593000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><why>Join us because you get to see this amazing movie "Totsi" for free and it will be a great opportunity to meet other people interested in conscious living.</why><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205345084000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Conscious Movie Night - Totsi</name><id>7518780</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205537400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/7518780/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/7/1/global_622209.jpeg</photo_url></item>
