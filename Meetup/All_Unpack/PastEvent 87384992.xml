I have room for 3 more. Itâ€™s just too late in the season for me to take novice sailors on a training run; I want experienced folk who have the proper training and attire for fall sailing. Hitting the RSVP button will not be enough to get you on this trip, I will be looking at your profile for qualifications and selecting accordingly. I will e mail you if your in. Normally I am happy to have a floating classroom, but the water is two cold now and other boats to render assistance are few on the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>sean</member_name><member_id>12819440</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1350929497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Boston Sailing Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-sailing</urlname><id>135687</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Sailing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1350493390000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>I will be sailing Sunday from the saltwater club in Hull on a Meritt 25 </name><id>87384992</id><duration>18000000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1350831600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-sailing/events/87384992/</event_url></item>
