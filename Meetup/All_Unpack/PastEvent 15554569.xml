Perhaps I'll find some fellow travelers.  This time, the MFA is hosting an Isabelle Huppert film festival and this movie is part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description is below.  Godard's movies are usually quite dense and require thought and conversation after - perfect for our movie group.  The movie is from 3- 4:30, so there will be time after for a good meal and, I hope, our usual good conversation.  I'll decide where exactly when I see how many people are coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is at 3:00 in the afternoon and because the movie is 30-years old, I don't anticipate it selling out ;-), so no need to buy tickets ahead of time.  But you do need to let me know if you'll be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the movie, I'll be over on the right side of the theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Man for Himself (Sauve qui peut (la vie) by Jean-Luc Godard (France, 1980, 89 min.). Employed by a television company, Paul is newly separated from his wife Denise. Isabelle (Huppert), a country girl, comes to the city to make a living as a prostitute. The three characters meet, talk, argue, have sex, and separate. A favorite Godard film among many scholars and critics, Every Man for Himself is a crucial and classic work of modern cinema. “So rich, dense, and subtle in imagery that I saw it twice…The film attacked me in what seemed to be a total way” (Gerald Peary, The Boston Phoenix).
