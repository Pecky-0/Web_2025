Breakheart Reservation is a 640-acre hardwood forest with jagged, rocky outcroppings, two fresh-water lakes, and a rambling section of the Saugus River. Seven rocky hills, over 200 feet high, provide vistas of Boston, southern New Hampshire and central Massachusetts. An extensive trail system through the woodlands guides visitors to various areas of the reservation. Fishing in Silver and Pearce Lakes, hiking the trails and birdwatching by the Saugus River are popular year-round activities. The supervised swimming area at Pearce Lake, one of the few fresh- water swimming spots north of Boston, draws crowds in the summer. In addition to its natural resources, the reservation has a rich cultural history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;.    &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kathryn</member_name><member_id>3302152</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1199808574000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Recreational Walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>walkers-255</urlname><id>415396</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1196615541000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Chestnut Hill Walking January Meetup</name><id>6842033</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199635200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/walkers-255/events/6842033/</event_url></item>
