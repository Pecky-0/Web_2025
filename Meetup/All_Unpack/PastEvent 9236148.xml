It's the biggest travel holiday in the US.&lt;br /&gt;Just decided to have a Thanksgiving supper here on FRIDAY the day after Thanksgiving, for anyone who is in town and would like to get together for a casual supper and some traditional New England Thanksgiving food. Nothing fancy, but we'll try to have a couple good dishes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not an English conversation meetup, just a gathering of friends for the holiday. (Chinese Meetup group and other friends have been invited)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call me for directions or email.
