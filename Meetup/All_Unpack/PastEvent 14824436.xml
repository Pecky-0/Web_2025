<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Save the date and stay tuned for trail descriptions.  I may change this from the 23rd to the 24th, depending on the weather. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at the parking area on 302, just south of the Crawford Depot info center and carpool up to the Edmands Trailhead.  We'll ascend via the Edmands Path to just below the summit of Eisenhower and then follow the Crawford Path over Mt. Pierce, past Mizpah Hut and down the Webster Cliff trail to the peak of Mt. Jackson.  From there, we will descend via the  Jackson branch of the Webster-Jackon trail.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the moderate nature of the ascent and descent, be prepared for the alpine zone and for poor weather conditions as the Crawford Path is VERY EXPOSED.  Expect cold weather conditions. DO NOT WEAR COTTON OR DENIM. While it is feasible to &amp;quot;get away with this&amp;quot; in summer, this can be dangerous in colder weather. October weather on the Presidentials IS COLDER. If you have questions about how to prepare or how to dress, ask them in advance. Bring plenty of water - sources on this route are scarce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of the payoff comes in the form of great views, SO if the weather looks like it will be better or clearer on Sunday, I will reschedule for Sunday instead. Please plan accordingly.&lt;/b&gt;  This is a dog friendly hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;RSVP Questions are not optional - If you do not provide me with a phone number to try and contact you on the morning of the hike (if necessary), I will not wait for you at the trailhead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book time is about 9 hrs,  10 miles. Plan on it taking this long, maybe a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plagerized Trail Descriptions for your benefit &lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;Copyright Â© the Appalachian Mountain Club.
