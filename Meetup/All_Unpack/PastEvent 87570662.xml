&lt;p&gt;For those of you with flexible Mondays, an excellent opportunity to see Khadigar Farm, work and learn with others, and support the important work of &lt;strong&gt;preserving plant diversity&lt;/strong&gt; for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven't heard of him, &lt;a href="http://www.fedcoseeds.com/moose/scatterseed.htm"&gt;Will Bonsall&lt;/a&gt; is one of the foremost seed savers in the USA, a curator of many crops for Seed Savers Exchange and adviser to the SSE board. Probably his most impressive collection is his potato collection, over 600 varieties (the largest collection of potato varieties outside peru). Â Many of you also know Will through the workshops he offers each year at the Common Ground Fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sadly, SSE has decided to centralize their efforts and drop many potato varieties, thus &lt;strong&gt;putting these cultivars at risk of extinction&lt;/strong&gt;! Because Will has lost funding from SSE his potato collection has fallen into rough shape and he needs some help harvesting potatoes for storage. Some of these varieties are extremely rare and may only exist in Will's collection. This is a important chance to have a hand in preserving genetic diversity and heritage crops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
