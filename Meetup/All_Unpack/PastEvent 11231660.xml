To accommodate all we will meet before AND after the show at the Orleans. We re running this event with the Wedeln Ski &amp;amp; Outdoor Club - several people will have &amp;quot;Wedeln&amp;quot; logo wear on - just say hello.  People can order apps or entrees but we will not have a big group meal. Instead just come by when you can and introduce yourself. I will have a blue and yellow jacket with a large &amp;quot;Wedeln ski &amp;amp; Outdoors Club&amp;quot; logo on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New schedule looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5:30pm Early arrivals at Orleans &lt;br /&gt;6:30pm Somerville Theatre - We will sit in the center of balcony &lt;br /&gt;9:30pm When movie lets out we will be back at Orleans for a larger celebration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.orleansres.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.orleansres...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have some area reserved at Orleans starting at 9:30pm, I assume the bar will be crowded but probably at least half will be part of our group. For the pre-movie arrivals we will look for a spot at the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today (11/3) there are still tickets available but you must purchase soon. this will sell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warren Miller movies are the gold standard for all ski/snowboard movies. Every Fall for 50 years the Warren Miller team has toured the country to show off its latest creation. It is not just a movie, its an event. This year the movie is titled &amp;quot;Dynasty&amp;quot; and the preview looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$19 may seem like a lot for a movie BUT you get several 2 for 1 lift tickets and other give-aways. You will make back your admission price - most years i go twice just to get the deals :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7pm but we will meet at a bar for drinks and snacks before the show and go over as a group. If people want to meet early we can get dinner. We can also have a few post-movie beers as well. This will be a great way to meet members of this meet up and make some connections before the snow starts falling. The Somerville Theatre is in the middle of Davis Sq, about a 50 ft walk from the RedLine station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy your tickets on your own as soon as possible, it will sell out - Somerville Theatre&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info on the movie and giveaways check out - &lt;a href="http://www.skinet.com.." target="_blank"&gt;http://www.skinet.com...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will let you know the bar when we get closer to the date.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Lane</member_name><member_id>5915593</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>13</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258241231000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Snowboarders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>snowboard-46</urlname><id>389975</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Somerville Snowboarding Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251560630000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Warren Miller Movie in Somerville</name><id>11231660</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258067700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/snowboard-46/events/11231660/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/2/global_10437618.jpeg</photo_url></item>
