This is very last minute, but I'm hosting a sort of housewarming backyard party this evening starting after 5pm. It is supposed to be windy so not sure if a firepit will be successful. I hosted two other bonfire parties since joining this meetup and met numerous great people through them. Unfortunately haven't had time to make it a formal one through the website until now. So this is more of a casual welcome wagon to fellow newcomers. If you are interested in stopping by in a non-bar environment, please send me a text at 401.345.0325 for directions. I live near Providence College on the west, northwest side of town. The gathering is outside to enjoy the weather, but note that I do have pets if you are allergic (they'll be hiding or kept in a room). BYOB, BYO-Chair, Blankets, etc. I'll have some hot apple cider and a little bit of turkey chili. If you are on your way out on the town or to OCCUPY Providence, stop by after 5/5:30! - val&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1318717103000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1318696840000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Welcome Wagon</name><id>37497092</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1318712400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/37497092/</event_url></item>
