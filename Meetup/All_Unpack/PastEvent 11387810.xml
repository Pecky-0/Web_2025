I've begun to schedule Brazilian music on Tuesday nights at Basha Cafe, and it's an ideal place for a meetup. It's a lovely restaurant with Middle Eastern food--beautiful decor, good food, and the tables are even already set up perfectly for a meetup! There's also space for dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm scheduling some of the best Brazilian music musicians in Boston, to make these nights a feast for the ears, as well as the appetite! The bands play all different kinds of music with Brazilian roots, so you can expand your knowledge of the music of Brazil at the same time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the deal: we meet at 7:00 for eats/drinks and conversa; music starts around 8. There's NO COVER; you just need to buy something to eat or drink. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll schedule the meetups every week so we can get a count, but you can put it on your calendar as a recurring event if you like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next week -- September 22 -- the wonderful Brazilian (mostly) instrumental choro group Choro Democratico will be playing. To learn about them, you can go to their website: www.chorodemocratico.com. This is a traditional Brazilian music with both European 19th-century and African roots, played on string instruments (bandolim/mandolin, 7-string guitar, cavaquinho, violin), with flute and pandeiro. You'll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of free parking around the restaurant; 10-15 minute walk from Alewife T. New Street is behind the Fresh Pond shopping Center, off Concord Ave. Also bus no. 74 from Harvard Square (Bennett Alley stop--near Charles Hotel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Espero que todos venham, a semana que vem e todas as ter√ßas!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Find my picture on Meetup; I look like that!
