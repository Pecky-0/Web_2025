(Don't tell the other restaurants now... they might not give us happy hour specials ;D ) It's my goal in life to share this love with everyone.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many places try 'too hard' to offer something for everyone, and they end up offering a half....baked version of something lame that pleases no one.  Not Olde School.  They manage to please seemingly every different set of clientele, from gourmet foodies, hipsters, high brow Yale alum, broke yuppies and punks. The staff is great, the food is amazing and the atmosphere is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olde School Saloon and Bistro is located at State near Court St, across from the train station. From the vintage copper bar right down to the classic antique punch-button cash register, this is a great place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of yucca fries with chipotle sauce doesnâ€™t hurt their charm either : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have generously offered to extend their usual happy hour specials for us, with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HALF PRICE Appetizers (and they're yummy.  Just sayin'...)&lt;br /&gt;$2.50 Narragansett Lager &amp;amp; Pabst Blue Ribbon&lt;br /&gt;$1 off ALL other drinks - wine, beer, mixed drinks and even their delicious cocktails....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP for this event as soon as you know so that I can give them an accurate heads up. If you're only a 'Maybe' please put this in your comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contact for this event is Dev, phone number in RSVP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://oldeschoolsaloonandbistro.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://oldeschoolsalo...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours.
