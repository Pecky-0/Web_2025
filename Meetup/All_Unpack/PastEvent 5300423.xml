Afterwork Mixer this Thursday  December  7th at  &lt;br /&gt;AQUA &amp;amp;  THE VAULT  (2 VENUES)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For young professionals alike in the heart of Boston's Financial District 6:00-9:30pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Th Afterwork mixer returns this Thursday December 7th. This time we are taking the party to Aqua and the Vault, 2 great financial district hotspots right across the street from each other. This is the final event of the year   so what better way to come out this Thurs and have a few cocktails with the group as we gear up for the holiday season and the start of 2007! &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;Meeting Details: We'll initally meet at Aqua before heading over to the Vault.   &lt;br /&gt; Meet &amp;amp; mingle from 6-7pm  at AQUA Lounge (120 Water St. between Congress &amp;amp; Broad st ). If unsure of this location I highly recommend going online (google) to get a better idea for directions. We will meet near the FRONT of the bar at Aqua.  Then head over to The Vault  around 7:00pm.  The  Vault is  quite possibly the  most entertaining, liveliest,  and crowded afterwork party   in Boston, therefore  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND meeting us at Aqua first   as it will be very CROWDED  at the Vault and finding new faces will be  nearly impossible. &lt;br /&gt;My picture is on the left hand side of the website  under the Assistant Organizer section. Also my phone is 617-671-5310. Please make note prior to arriving.  Happy Holidays, look forward to seeing you all there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Transportation: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Line to Govt Center &lt;br /&gt;Red Line to Park St /Downtown Crossing &lt;br /&gt;Orange Line to State St/Downtown Crossing &lt;br /&gt;Blue Line to State St/Govt Center/Aqaurium  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlie - Nightlife Organizer</member_name><member_id>2175480</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1165705620000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Night Life Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-nightlife</urlname><id>111392</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Night Life Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1164948341000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seasons Greetings:  Afterwork Mixer Year End Finale at Aqua &amp; the Vault!!</name><id>5300423</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1165532400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-nightlife/events/5300423/</event_url></item>
