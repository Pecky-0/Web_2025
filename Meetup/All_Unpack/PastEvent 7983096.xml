We reward speed, size and above all else: winning - at sport, at business and at war. Metaphorically we are a nation on steroids. Is it any wonder that so many of our heroes are on performance enhancing drugs? From the producers of Bowling For Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11 comes a new film that unflinchingly explores our win-at-all-cost culture through the lens of a personal journey. Blending comedy and pathos, BIGGER, STRONGER, FASTER* is a collision of pop culture, animated sequences and first-person narrative, with a diverse cast including US Congressmen, professional athletes, medical experts and everyday gym rats. At its heart, this is the story of director Christopher Bell and his two brothers, who grew up idolizing muscular giants like Hulk Hogan, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and who went on to become members of the steroid-subculture in an effort to realize their American dream. When you discover that your heroes have all broken the rules, do you follow the rules, or do you follow your heroes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: orange"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening in theaters: June 6, 2008&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Chelsea</member_name><member_id>3861711</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214356111000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>From the producers of "Bowling for Columbine," and "Fahrenheit 9/11," BIGGER STRONGER FASTER was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.</why><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211380222000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>FREE ADVANCED SCREENING - BIGGER STRONGER FASTER</name><id>7983096</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1211497200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/7983096/</event_url></item>
