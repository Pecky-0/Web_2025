&lt;p&gt;PechaKucha Night was devised in Tokyo in February 2003 as an event for young designers to meet, network, and show their work in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has turned into a massive celebration, with events happening in hundreds of cities around the world, inspiring creatives worldwide. Drawing its name from the Japanese term for the sound of conversation ("chit chat"), it rests on a presentation format that is based on a simple idea: 20 images x 20 seconds. &lt;br /&gt;

It's a format that makes presentations concise, and keeps things moving at a rapid pace. &lt;br /&gt;

It's a free event where you can have a drink, a snack and laugh!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bella Zadore</member_name><member_id>33517782</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352339634000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Winos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup</urlname><id>593834</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven  Wine and Dining  Meetup Group,</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351951566000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pecha Kucha</name><id>89774042</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>6300000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352332800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Wine-and-Dining-Meetup/events/89774042/</event_url></item>
