We will start the group with a brief discussion, then listen to our talk of the week. This week we will be listening to veteran meditation teacher Jack Kornfield as he talks about healing. Jack has been leading meditation retreats, writing books, and traveling the world in his own wise, compassionate, and humorous way for more that 30 years.  Also included will be a meditation and a time to set intentions for the coming week. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>TomC</member_name><member_id>7931343</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275952445000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1275229075000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jack Kornfield on Healing</name><id>qmmdnynjbkb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1275948000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/13638328/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
