Think Maine does not have disasters?  Think again?remember Hurricane Bob, the ice storm and the recent flooding up in Aroostook County?   Maine residents do face disasters and with just a little planning you can help to keep yourselves, your family and your pets safe and provided for.   Please join us and learn how!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like a presentation like this in your neck of the woods, too, please give me a shout!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be meeting in the lobby of the shelter facility for a training on personal disaster preparedness.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Katie Lisnik</member_name><member_id>4363575</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1217716861000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Animal Welfare Advocates</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>animalwelfare-182</urlname><id>601218</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>The Maine Animal Welfare Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1211569607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brunswick Disaster Preparedness Meet-Up</name><id>7999614</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217543400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/animalwelfare-182/events/7999614/</event_url></item>
