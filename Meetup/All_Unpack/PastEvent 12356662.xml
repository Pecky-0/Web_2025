We will start the group by listening to a talk or watching a video, which lasts about one hour, and will follow with discussion about the content and our experiences. Also included will be a short meditation and a time to set intentions for the coming week. Please join us in mindful community as we seek to bring more awareness, wisdom and compassion into our lives and into the world.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267053166000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Mindful Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-703</urlname><id>1270329</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263859563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Mindfulness Meetup</name><id>12356662</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266879600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-703/events/12356662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/0/global_10129760.jpeg</photo_url></item>
