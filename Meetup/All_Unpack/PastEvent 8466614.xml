You can work on whatever you want. This is a great chance for novice paddlers to learn from more experienced paddlers and improve your paddling skills. Experienced paddlers, this a a great way to &amp;quot;pass it forward&amp;quot; and share your skills and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please post replies here if there is interest &lt;br /&gt;Examples of skills practiced: forward stroke, reverse stroke, edging &amp;amp; turning, sweep strokes, low &amp;amp; high bracing, rolling, self and assisted rescues, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This venue offers a trememdous opportunity to better your paddling skills. The inner harbor has flat, protected water...ideal for learning basics. For those more adventurous or looking to take their paddling to the next level....just a short paddle and we can be on the open ocean off Seabrook Beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COME ON OUT AND HAVE SOME FUN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL LEVELS are welcome. Rec boat paddlers are welcome but will be strongly encouraged to stay inside the harbor and not venture out into the open ocean. Sea kayakers wanting to go into the open ocean should have a spray skirt, paddle float and pump at a minimum. PFD's must be worn at all times while in the boats.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Park in Parking Lot just over the Hampton Bridge on Seabrook Side Look for kayak</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Neil Sheehan</member_name><member_id>7739813</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1218572062000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NE Seacoast Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NESeacoastPaddlers</urlname><id>1238731</id><group_lat>42.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8199996948</group_lon><name>NE Seacoast Paddlers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217769181000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skills Session at  Seabrook/Hampton Harbor</name><id>8466614</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218398400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NESeacoastPaddlers/events/8466614/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/3/global_4981987.jpeg</photo_url></item>
