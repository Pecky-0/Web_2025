<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We have a growing demand for Meetups on Saturdays...so here you go.  We'll meet at 21 Lemon St. (the pumpkin-colored house) at 7:00 p.m.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any favorite games, feel free to bring them.  We can play large group games, or we can split up into two different rooms.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is parking available on Lemon St. and more parking available on Northey St. (one block closer to the T) and on Cross St. (which tees into Lemon). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Also, just a note again, the house is home to two cats for those who are allergic. For those who aren't allergic but don't like cats, they will be put away for the evening. I apologize for those with allergies, we just need more volunteers to host in their cat-free homes.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, David and I are more than happy to host in our home, but for those who would like to host, please speak up and we can start putting more dates on the calendar.  It is also possible to move this event to someone else's home, should you want to host this day.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1195137433000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1192163375000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November 10 Game Night</name><id>6535089</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194739200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/6535089/</event_url></item>
