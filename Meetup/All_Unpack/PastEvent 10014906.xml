This movie has a run time of about 2 hours so we should be arriving at around 4:00.  I will do call ahead seating for the number of people who have responded yes to this event prior to us going in to the movie.  So if you can't join us for the movie and would like to join us for dinner that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who don't know Bugaboo Creek is a fun steak house...each time I have been there the food was great and the atmosphere was very relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Just ask for The Fun Singles party.....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Judie</member_name><member_id>5431837</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281130664000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Ma-NH-Singles-Club</urlname><id>1356935</id><group_lat>43.1300010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9800033569</group_lon><name>Trailblazers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237814406000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Late Lunch\Early Dinner at Bugaboo Creek</name><id>10014906</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1238961600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Ma-NH-Singles-Club/events/10014906/</event_url></item>
