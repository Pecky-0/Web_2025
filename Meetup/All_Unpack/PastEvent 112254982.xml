Our goal is to establish a humanist community that will organize and implement programs and events in and around Hartford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What types of programs and events? That is up to everyone. All humanists (and those who are interested in humanism) are invited to come to our Organizational Meeting. There are only two items on the agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Socialize!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Brainstorm on future activities and events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those from outside of the greater-Hartford area are welcome to come and participate in the first steps of the newest member of the humanist and secular community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism and other supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also join the new Hartford Humanists Meetup Group to be sure that you get notified of all Hartford events!&lt;/p&gt;
