These Asylums were laundries where supposedly &amp;quot;fallen&amp;quot; young women would be rehabilitated. Many of these young women would spend the rest of their lives there. These were places of horrendous physical and psychological abuse, and inhumane living conditions. The last of the &amp;quot;Magdalene Laundries,&amp;quot; as they came to be called, closed in 1996. This movie painfully depicts the plight of four young women in one of these institutions and how they suffered at the hands of the nuns who had lost their love for humanity and colluded in the horrible treatment of the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every month the Centers of Light choose a global cause and show a movie related to the cause. The focus of this month’s cause is to raise awareness of the reality of child abuse in its many forms throughout the globe. From starvation to disease to victimization, the plight of children needs to be addressed and brought into the light, so that we may correct these abuses and neglect. Children all over the world are suffering and need our prayers and assistance to lift them from their poverty, both physical and spiritual. This month we will donate to the International Children’s Fund, which focuses on work across the African continent. If you feel moved to join us in making a donation, great, but this movie is free and we are mainly interested in people being aware of the situation. The ICF has 98% efficiency in its use of funds, using local, grassroots ministers and missionaries to distribute food, medicine, clothing, equipment, and funds to locations where children are most in need. The costs of distribution, therefore, remain low while reliability of delivery is very high. Most importantly, these workers bring help and hope to children who have suffered so much in their short lives. Visit the International Children's Fund website for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Center of Light is on the Framingham Common on Edgell Road.  If you need directions, you can use Mapquest (85 Edgell Road Framingham MA 01701).  Parking is available along the driveway on the right side of the house.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286128574000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Consciousness movie members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>consciousness-65</urlname><id>355065</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Conscious Movie Meetup!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284487525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>October Conscious Movie:  The Magdalene Sisters</name><id>14768192</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286060400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/consciousness-65/events/14768192/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/3/4/global_17967636.jpeg</photo_url></item>
