<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We've been on a bit of a hiatus from hosting events, but now that we're done with moving, we're excited to get back into game playing. (Note our address has changed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you have a favorite game please bring it; otherwise, you know we're well stocked. You are also welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have plenty to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have never attended a traditional game night, we usually split up in different rooms to play smaller games of players' choice and then come together for a larger game or two at the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats, but they will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to a well-behaved one year old, who will obviously not be locked up for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is a little tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.  &lt;b&gt;In the event of a snow emergency, this event will be canceled&lt;/b&gt;  Should the weather turn, please have our number with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Members who have been a &amp;quot;no-show&amp;quot; in the last three months will not be permitted to RSVP for this event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1264889210000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262640658000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Traditional Game Night</name><id>12220193</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264291200000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/12220193/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/1/global_11205793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
