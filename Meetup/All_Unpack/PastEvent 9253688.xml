This hike covers 5.8 miles and is a thru hike.  Time on the trail should be no more than 4 hours.  This means we will meet at the end point and a couple of folks will drive everyone to the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will begin on Pine Mountain Rd.  This dirt road off of Rt. 179 goes into Tunxis State Forest and we will walk it for about 1.5 miles.  We will then head south on the blue blaze Tunxis Trail.  This will take us over Pine Mountain at a blistering 1391' elevation (from sea level).  The trail is rugged but interesting.  Our goal is the council caves from here.  This is an area of huge glacier boulders with cave-like pockets.  Many native american artifacts have been found here but it is not known if the area was used for council meetings.  From there we will successfully stumble out of the woods onto Rt. 219 and the cars.  Hopefully those of us who drove can get rides back to the start :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are meeting at the parking area at Hillcrest Dr. and Rt. 219.  Parking at this spot is limited so head down Hillcrest for parking on the side of the road.  Make sure you are wearing warm layers and include a hat and gloves.  I will check the weather closer to the date.  Bring at least a liter of water and snacks.  We will certainly stop for a food break but not a full buffet lunch on the trail.  Since we are shuttling people please be on time.  We will leave the parking area by 9:45 to be on the trail for 10:00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Barkhamsted&amp;amp;state=CT&amp;amp;address=1+Hillcrest+Dr&amp;amp;zipcode=06063" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=== Legal Stuff === &lt;br /&gt;By clicking on &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; for this event you agree, warrant, and covenant as follows: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In consideration for accepting this entry, I, the registrant, intending to be legally bound, hereby, for myself, my heirs, my executors and administrators, do waive and release any and all rights for damages I may have against any parties or persons connected with the Hartford Area Hiking meetup group for and related to the above listed event.
