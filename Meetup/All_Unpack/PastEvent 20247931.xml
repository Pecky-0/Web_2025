It's taking place Saturday, June 11,  starting at 11 am and running to 11 pm. I might have to cap attendance  despite having four tables available for gaming, so please RSVP if you  plan to attend. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;As an additional incentive to attend, I'm selling hundreds of games  via auction on BGG: Talisman, Maarvel Heroes, Stronghold, Vinci,  Tahuantinsuyu and many more. Lots of unplayed and brely played games  that I don't plan to pack on the moving truck. The auction ends June 6,  and you can conveniently pick them up on June 11. How thoughtful of me!
