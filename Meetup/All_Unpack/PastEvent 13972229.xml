<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>I thought that this weekends Fourth of July fireworks displays around New England would present an irresistible photography subject.  I also thought  most people have plans already and scheduling a meet-up would conflict with those  plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of an actual get together I propose having a virtual event, &lt;b&gt;a challenge to shoot the fireworks at your location&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;and to use this challenge as a way to compare results.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have produced a &lt;b&gt;FIREWORKS PHOTOGRAPHY TIP SHEET&lt;/b&gt; to help guide you on your individual pursuit of this fun and challenging subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shoot the fireworks display in your town and post them to this event so we all can see your results.  We can use the discussion board to share information and experiences about shooting the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab your cameras and tripods and enjoy the 4th!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Shoot the Fireworks in your town and share them here on this event page!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan Splaine</member_name><member_id>8817946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1278202691000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Photography-Workshops</urlname><id>1540111</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>New England Photography Workshops</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278000795000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fireworks challenge!</name><id>13972229</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278198000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Photography-Workshops/events/13972229/</event_url></item>
