Last gig there last month had 15 members, and great time was had by all! Both accomplished performers in their own right; they are together again with acoustic and electric guitars, and beautiful harmonies. Sometimes surprise performers; yu never know?! &lt;br /&gt;

**arrive early for seat, and bite around 7-7:30pm. Co-hosted by Bon Bailey and Patricia [but,unavoidably, I am arriving later from my job in Boston; so the Great and Ever Humble, Don Bailey will hold down the fort for early arrivals]. Great drink and nibbles off the menu by Jared and Team. Free Parking, NO cover [which yu will find incredible when yu see them!], AC!! &lt;br /&gt;

of course. Don's cell # 603 724-9402 to confirm early seating, please.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343392452000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Dating-Meeting-in-So-NH-the-Merrimack-Valley</urlname><id>1116818</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Meeting &amp; Greeting in So.
