I thought others might be in the same situation, so a weekday movie night sounded like fun. :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll be watching at the Loews Boston Common movie theater downtown, the 7:10 pm showing.  You can buy your tickets in advance or at the movie theater.  I think we should plan to meet at 7:00pm, that way there is time to find seats together and get popcorn or snacks if you want.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone feels up to it afterward, there are lots of fun places nearby to go for a drink.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Movie Summary: &lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up in the Air&lt;br /&gt;Cast: George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Amy Morton&lt;br /&gt;Rated R&amp;#8206;&amp;#8206; - Comedy/Drama&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;1hr 49min&amp;#8206;&amp;#8206;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan Bingham, a corporate hatchet man who loves his life on the road, is forced to fight for his job when his company downsizes its travel budget. He is required to spend more time at home just as he is on the cusp of a goal he's worked toward more Â»for years: reaching five million frequent flyer miles and just after he's met the frequent-traveler woman of his dreams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263514035000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262638146000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie Night: Up In The Air</name><id>12219656</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263340800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/12219656/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/c/global_6726124.jpeg</photo_url></item>
