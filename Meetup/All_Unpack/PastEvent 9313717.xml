<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Our January meeting will feature guest speaker Bob Martens. Bob is well known to many of us as the face of the FAA. He has since retired from his position there as a FAA Safety advisor, but we cornered him to be our speaker this month and he agreed. &lt;br /&gt;Bob is a wonderful speaker and continues to promote GA. &lt;br /&gt;Jim Adams of the FAA has agreed to allow this as a WINGS program and will be advertised as one. I expect another real big turnout, wx permitting, on this one. Bring your questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a link to Pilot Workshops. Bob is a speaker for them also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pilotworkshops.com/public/183.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pilotworks...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, food at 6:00 and meeting at 7:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll also be discussing the direction for 2009. My feeling is our Fly-outs have been a big hit. Keeping them more family oriented and often. More in the summer than winter, but let's keep flying! There will be some changes this year and let's all et involved to make them what we want out of this club. We have an awesome group and everyone has agreed to pitch in one way or another....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you all in January.&lt;br /&gt;Charley&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ Hume</member_name><member_id>4096811</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Reinhart</member_name><member_id>6711977</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234309213000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228912161000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association EAA Chapter 1454 January Meetup</name><id>9313717</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231887600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/9313717/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/c/1/global_4198801.jpeg</photo_url></item>
