It encapsulates the 4th Ed. D&amp;amp;D experience into a self-contained board game that recreates (quite well if I do say so myself) the gothic horror experience of the original Castle Ravenloft adventure.  There are a number of scenarios that can be played in the game, whether it's a daylight assault to steal Strahd's treasures or an epic battle against Strahd himself to once and for all end his evil reign over the land of Barovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other game being presented is Betrayal at House on the Hill.  This is another dungeon exploration game, though this is set in a classic haunted mansion with evil scientists, cursed ghosts, and other horrors awaiting those who enter the abode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to have two tables of players play a scenario in each game, then switch off and try the other.  Each game takes an hour or two to play through a particular scenario, so the whole event will likely run 3-4 hours with a short break in the middle.  Hope to see you guys there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanios&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287188126000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286921944000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Castle Ravenloft: The Board Game &amp; Betrayal at House on the Hill</name><id>15088811</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287009000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/15088811/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
