&lt;p&gt;This year my clambake will be in August, I usually do this in September but it just won't work this year, so August it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a BYOLC clambake, meaning you bring your own lobster and clams, and something to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your $5 I provide the cooking utensils, soda, corn on the cob, butter and place settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we'll be at Hilton Park.  In previous years we were at Fort McCleary which was great but people got lost, last year we were at 4 Tree Island which was nice, but a long walk over the causeway and difficult to find parking.  Hilton Park should solve those problems, it's exit 5 off the Spaulding turnpike just over the bridge from Portsmouth to Dover.  There is plenty of parking and we can park close to the picnic tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no rain date, if weather looks iffy check this site for updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be in the vicinity of the playground.  Look for the site with the most picnic tables.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bob Lamothe</member_name><member_id>6364190</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1345949145000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Trailblazers-seacoast-singles</urlname><id>519189</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>Trailblazers- A Seacoast Singles Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342297221000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BYOLC Clambake</name><id>73349292</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345917600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Trailblazers-seacoast-singles/events/73349292/</event_url></item>
