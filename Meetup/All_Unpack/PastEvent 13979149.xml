I picked one that I would want to see again &amp;quot;Star Trek&amp;quot;. Its more about the experience than the movie itself. If you are interested come join us for some outdoor fun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Storrow Drive, The Esplanade, Boston, MA directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Usually, the city of Boston closes the right lane of Storrow Drive next to the Hatch Shell on days when there are concerts and movies. Parts of Beacon Hill have sporadic spots, but very few for non-residents. Charles Street has limited parking but fills up quickly - especially on Friday nights. Your best bet is to take public transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Public Transportation:&lt;br /&gt;Take Red Line to Charles (Street)/MGH station or the Green line to Arlington station. Walk down Arl ington St. toward Beacon St. &amp;amp; cross Beacon St. You will see the big Arthur Fiedler Walkway in front of you. Walk across the walkway and the Hatch Shell is on your right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: They show movies rain or shine, but I may decide to cancel it if it rains.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karan</member_name><member_id>8985082</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1279676783000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278038463000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Free Movie</name><id>13979149</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1279323900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/13979149/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
