There are some options you could rsvp about: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;a href="http://www.lymanorchards.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Lyman's Orchards&lt;/a&gt; is 30 minutes away and has the store and a driving range too. &lt;br /&gt;*&lt;a href="http://www.bishopsorchards.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bishop's Orchards&lt;/a&gt; is 20 minutes away and has a store and is near hiking trails at &lt;a href="http://www.westwoodstrails.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Westwood Trails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;a href="http://www.rosesberryfarm.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rose's Berry Farm&lt;/a&gt; is 50 minutes away and serves breakfast til 1 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I've located the event at Bishop's in Guilford. We'll meet in the parking area of the picking area, not the store at 10:30 am. On Saturday or Sunday, I will need to call the information line to see how the picking is and opening times and will update this posting accordingly.  If the weather is rainy I'll likely cancel. You can bring your own containers if you like. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT - The pick your own cash registers don't take credit cards, cash only. You can buy Bishop's strawberries, pre-picked at their store, and there they do take cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Karen&lt;br /&gt;cell: 203-535-8751&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182868828000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181853821000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Strawberry Picking at Bishop's Orchard</name><id>5892173</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1182695400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5892173/</event_url></item>
