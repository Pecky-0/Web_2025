From the Brookline Booksmith website: Join us as Lev Grossman (Codex) unveils the sequel to his international best-selling sensation The Magicians. After becoming the kings and queens of the magical realm of Fillory, Quentin and his friends find themselves dumped back into the all-too-ordinary world, where they have to rely on black magic to survive. In this grown-up epic for fans of Harry Potter and C.S. Lewis, Grossman casts an irresistible spell. I'm not very familiar with this store, but it should be possible to meet out front. The signing starts at 7:00 (or 7:30, if you believe Lev's website), so we'll go to find seats together at 6:00. I'll be there from 5:30 or so, and I'll have a Red and White Meetup sign. If you arrive later than 6:00, just come on in and find a seat.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom "spot" Callaway</member_name><member_id>2590946</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1313178181000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1311702793000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Author Reading / Signing - Lev Grossman</name><id>27107601</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1313100000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/27107601/</event_url></item>
