Email organizer if you're interested an we'll see about opening that up *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join member Tree Tenney on her 11-acre property in Hollis (about half an hour from downtown Portland) to &lt;b&gt;forage, cook and taste some wonderful spring wild edibles&lt;/b&gt;.  Tree reports that many examples (including some from Tom Seymour's great book Foraging New England) will be awaiting us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Space is limited and I expect this will fill quickly.  Please email me if you want to get on the waiting list!  (Or if anyone else has the property and expertise to host a similar skillshare I am happy to schedule it here...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough Agenda:&lt;br /&gt;10:00 am arrival and start of forage walk&lt;br /&gt;1:00 pm-ish cooking and tasting + potluck lunch (bring something to complement the &amp;quot;greens&amp;quot;) or bread/beverage&lt;br /&gt;2:00-3:00 pm wrap up and head home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event will happen even if there's a light mist, but in the event of heavy rain check the &amp;quot;comments&amp;quot; for this page in case Tree decides to cancel (and we'll refund your registration $)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring your own potluck kit (plate/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin)! Please consider bringing your digital camera and posting up a few photos after the event!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272290640000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268654932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skillshare:  Spring Forage and Tasting</name><id>12879784</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272117600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/12879784/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/1/c/global_4990380.jpeg</photo_url></item>
