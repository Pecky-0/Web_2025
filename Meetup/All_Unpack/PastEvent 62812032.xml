&lt;p&gt;With such hits as "If You Could Read My Mind," "Sundown," and "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald," few singer/songwriters have given as much quality material to the medium as Canadian-born troubadour Gordon Lightfoot. A five time Grammy nominee and seventeen time Juno winner, Gordon Lightfoot is also a member of the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. His songs have been recorded by everyone from Elvis Presley to Barbara Streisand to Bob Dylan. Donâ€™t miss this legend live in concert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure that I am going, but thought I would post in case there is someone interested. Dinner before is always an option too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337094136000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1327432</id><group_lat>43.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-72.3000030518</group_lon><name>Lebanon/White River Junction  Hiking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1335819551000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gordon Lightfoot at the Lebanon Opera House.</name><id>62812032</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337038200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Lebanon-Hiking-Meetup-Group/events/62812032/</event_url></item>
