This is a unique opportunity to enjoy the summer day and practice all that you learned at the previous day's workshops; without the pressure of being under the watchful eyes of the Steady Steppers Instructors, just you, your notes and the support of your fellow steppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The venue is outdoors, open gazebo, with a covered top.  Dress appropriately for weather conditions, it will occur rain or shine. Wear your Steppers of Boston shirts and gear. The dance floor is polished stone, comfy shoes are a must.  This will be our 2nd time this season bringing this unique, and fun experience to the steppers.  Bring your lawn chair and snacks, if you like. (no grills or open flame)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a closed event for The Original Steppers of Boston Inc only**.  The general public is not invited, nor will it be publicized to the general public.  We may draw a few spectators, of those folks that just happen to be walking by at the time.  Membership to The Original Steppers of Boston Incorporated has it's privileges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Only Meetup members can see this location **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;Please RSVP... we need an accurate headcount. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for me wearing my Stepper's shirt &amp; listen for the steppin' tunes</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gentleman Scott</member_name><member_id>4548946</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey </member_name><member_id>5014779</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295801658000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Original Steppers of Boston</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Steppers-of-Boston</urlname><id>1340809</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Original Steppers of Boston Inc. 2006</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272501693000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Practice in the Park Set 7/11/10 - 5:30pm </name><id>13324640</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1278883800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Steppers-of-Boston/events/13324640/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/a/global_14700426.jpeg</photo_url></item>
