The 40-story steel and glass tower, 30 St Mary Axe, sparks further controversy in its shape alone. Lord Norman Foster, one of Britain's most visionary architects and architect of The New MFA, calls his design &amp;quot;radical: socially, technically, architecturally, and spatially.&amp;quot; So radical that it is immediately nicknamed &amp;quot;the erotic gherkin&amp;quot; by sub-editors at the Guardian magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can one building transform an architect's career, a company's global image, and the skyline of one of the world's greatest cities? Co-presented by Swiss House. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MFA members, seniors, and students $8; general admission $9.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This event is being hosted by Nicole, your friendly Meetup assistant organizer. As always, the host will be holding a Meetup sign at the front of the theater to rally the group for conversation at a local cafe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_St_Mary_Axe" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt; - 30 St Mary Axe (aka the gherkin) on wikipedia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174929048000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172860686000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Building the Gherkin - Provocative Architecture</name><id>5530425</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1174688100000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5530425/</event_url></item>
