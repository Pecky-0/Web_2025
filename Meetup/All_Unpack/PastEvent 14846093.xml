In 2009 he returned to his climbing roots with an expedition that took him deep into the Indian Himalaya, to 22,000-foot, Mount Meru. The climb was the ultimate test to Jimmy and his partners. Aiming for a summit atop thousands of feet of sheer granite, their eighteen-day ascent was racked by storm and cold. Forced to dig deep into their souls to find the will to continue, they survived on teamwork and trust, and came away with the hardest climb of their careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jimmychin.com" target="_blank"&gt;More about Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Reserve your tickes ahead of time!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nate McKenzie</member_name><member_id>10557655</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287498649000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ctrockclimbing</urlname><id>1388805</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>CT Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285088229000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The North Face Speaker Series: Jimmy Chin</name><id>14846093</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287442800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ctrockclimbing/events/14846093/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/e/4/global_18143092.jpeg</photo_url></item>
