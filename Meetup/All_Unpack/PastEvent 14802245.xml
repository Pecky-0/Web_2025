Walk 4 miles around the pond on wide flat trails,  one area is narrow and rocky with some hills but it is very short. Good walking shoes recommended. Bring along your insect repellent and a towel for wet dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's meet at Fisherman's Beach. The entrance to the parking lot is on Randolph Street, left after the temple (coming from the highway) or on the right after the horsefarm (coming from Randolph). Don't park in front of the fire gate directly across from the horsefarm, that is the AMC entrance. &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet in the park just inside the second firegate where the trail maps are posted</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>12513071</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285686999000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Dog Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>packwalk</urlname><id>1030709</id><group_lat>42.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0</group_lon><name>The South Shore Dog Lovers Pack Walk</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284728856000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ponkapoag Pond Weekday Walk</name><id>14802245</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285074000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/packwalk/events/14802245/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/9/global_13435449.jpeg</photo_url></item>
