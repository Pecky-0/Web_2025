<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Please join us for a discussion of Chapter 5 of &amp;quot;The Artist's Way&amp;quot; or Chapter 4 of &amp;quot;Finding Water.&amp;quot; Chapter 5 is &amp;quot;Recovering a Sense of Possibility,&amp;quot; which seems well-matched to this week's breath of Spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll spend the first half hour reviewing chapter topics, followed by an hour talking in small groups (with at least one group dedicated to &amp;quot;Finding Water&amp;quot;). We'll end with a half hour of general discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a copy of the book you're following and a pen or pencil. You should read the appropriate book and chapter before coming to the meetup so we can discuss the main topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information on finding either book is on the message board (under the &amp;quot;discussions&amp;quot; tab above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you missed a meeting, and would like to review the small group exercises, you can email Heather to request a worksheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information about parking and public transportation near Gallery 263 can also be found on the message board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: tomato"&gt;**Please note that we are still meeting at 7pm **&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: seagreen"&gt;If you are able, please bring a $5 donation to the Gallery for the use of their space -- thank you!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will greet you at the door</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Heather</member_name><member_id>8367984</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268953786000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Artists and Creators!</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Artists-Way-Boston-area</urlname><id>1471304</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Artists Way Boston Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265331926000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Artists Way Cambridge Meetup</name><id>wjxfmynfbpb</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268352000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Artists-Way-Boston-area/events/12522916/</event_url></item>
