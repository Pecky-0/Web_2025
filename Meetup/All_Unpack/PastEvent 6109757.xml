The pond is adjacent to the parking area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO MEET: 3-3:30 at the Pond&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: From route 93N, take the Fellsway West Winchester exit, go half way around the rotary (over the highway) onto your first left. From 93S it will be the same exit but it will be your first right. In both cases, that turn will be marked by South Border Road and/or a Hospital sign. Once on that road Wright Pond is a quarter mile on your right, marked by a small parking area, the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER:&lt;br /&gt;            RSVPs: It's best to let us know you are coming so we can look for you or alert you to any changes. &lt;br /&gt; WHAT TO BRING: If you have any questions about what to bring, don't hesitate to ask.&lt;br /&gt;            IF LOST: If you become lost getting there, call.&lt;br /&gt;            LAX: You have a half hour of leeway to meet us. After that we may leave without you.&lt;br /&gt;            INCLEMENT WEATHER: It is up to you to determine if the weather makes painting untenable. Although, I will try to leave a message on my voice mail if I myself do not intend to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Emerald&lt;br /&gt;617/968-0627&lt;br /&gt;westpointusma@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael Emerald, CFA</member_name><member_id>3007793</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186427121000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>painter-84</urlname><id>576650</id><group_lat>42.4500007629</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1500015259</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Plein Air Artists Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185989315000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wright Pond, in the Middlesex Fells Reservation</name><id>6109757</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186254000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/painter-84/events/6109757/</event_url></item>
