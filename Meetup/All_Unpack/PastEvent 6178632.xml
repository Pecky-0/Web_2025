I will also have handouts of an optional ab workout for when you return.  After you are done your run, you don't have to stay, but If you'd like, stretch, do ab work, show off your tri arms at the outside gym, or just chit chat and catch up as everyone comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the group, we can decided how much of a run to go for along the esplanade.  We will meet at the waterfountain/ outdoor gym thing on the boston side of the esplanade.  For those of you who don't know where this, is the best place to park is on Bay state Road probably between # 130 and 175 or the intersection of Bay State Rd and Sherborn.   Then head down Sherborn towards the Charles and over the pedestrian walkway over storrow drive.  The outdoor gym and waterfountain will be right in front of you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541949000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Triathletes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mass-Tri</urlname><id>584357</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8399963379</group_lon><name>Mass Tri</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1187104360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Esplanade Run</name><id>6178632</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187303400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mass-Tri/events/6178632/</event_url></item>
