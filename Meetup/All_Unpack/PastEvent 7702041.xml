Rod Machado.... sort of... well, we have a DVD of his. Called Aviation Humor. Rod is a unique speaker and all his seminars are standing room only. Even if you've seen this or heard him before, you might want to attend this one. An easy meeting laughing at ourselves.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we'll discuss the upcoming June 14th EAA Young Eagles Rally and more.  &lt;br /&gt;If you missed the last meeting, you missed a lot! We had a great meeting and lots of information from Jim Adams of FAA Safety team was on hand.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ Hume</member_name><member_id>4096811</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>charley valera</member_name><member_id>4792795</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Reinhart</member_name><member_id>6711977</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210895459000</updated><rating><average>4.17000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><why>Dinner, slide show and chat from 6:00 - 7:00.
