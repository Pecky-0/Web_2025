Diane's group will meet at the Crawford Connector lot, across from the Highland Center on Mt Clinton Road, I-95 to exit 35, right on to Rte 3 North, right on to Rte 302. The Mt Clinton Road is 8.2 miles east on your left. The AMC Highland Center is .2 mile nearby. Take the first left (just before the gate) and park in the large lot.  We will drive a few cars to the Edmund Path lot, then gear up for a 9 am start on Edmund Path. These trails have great footing with gentle elevation gain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/45/179503740_4f4d08bd8b_m.jpg" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Itinerary:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our group will hike up on the easy side of moderate 3.6 miles of Edmands Path to Mt Eisenhower (4760' on the 48 list).
