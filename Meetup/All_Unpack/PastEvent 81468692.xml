&lt;p&gt;I know this is kinda late, but contra dancing is a lot of fun, great exercise, and there's always live music. The Worcester monthly dance gets a varied crowd from young children, college students, and everyone into their 80's! It is a natural outlet for hikers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contra is an American folk dance, set to live folk music, in which a caller instructs the dancers through each set of moves. As the song continues, dancers progress along a line of other dancers, regularly swapping partners and enjoying new company while mastering the pattern of the current dance. New England's answer to square dancing is very easy to learn and very welcoming to newcomers. Dancing starts at 8:00 PM and goes until 11:00 PM, with a half-hour beginners' lesson beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1347214643000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1347124993000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Contra Dance</name><id>81468692</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1347148800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group/events/81468692/</event_url></item>
