 Milford Mall's annual festival and fireworks show is this Tuesday, July 3rd. It is happening on the rooftop of the parking garage. There will be live bands, vendors, food, and drinks, followed by a fireworks show around 9:30 that is synched to music. I'll be there around 7 to get seats, but you may also wish to come early as I don't know how much space I can save. A lawn chair is a good idea, which you can pick up at Walmart or a similar store for under $20 if you don't have one. This should be a fun time, so come out and join us! Hope to see you there! &lt;br /&gt;

-Neil &lt;br /&gt;
