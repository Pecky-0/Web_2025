<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi group,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the word from Pat Droney that this Friday will not work for the church - scheduling conflict. We can begin the following Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have asked Ginny and Jim to prepare an outline of an agenda. At the meeting we will choose/elect people to assume specific responsibilities. We will have the room for approx. 1 hour so please bring along your long-term goals, solutions and strategies and possible snares to your goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone would like to bring food/drinks that would be a nice touch - if not we will make arrangements to do so for the subsequent meetings. We are required to keep the space clean and orderly - that goes without saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you get an email to the contrary the meeting time will be: Friday, October 2nd @ 6:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;The meeting place is: Lutheran Church Of Our Redeemer, 20 North Street, Enfield, CT  (860) 749-3167).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In patriotism,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carole&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254695622000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Patriots</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots</urlname><id>1491323</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Constitutional Tea Party Patriots</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253465748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NCC Monthly Meetup</name><id>11419511</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254522600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Constitutional-Tea-Party-Patriots/events/11419511/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/4/global_10345540.jpeg</photo_url></item>
