<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Join the&amp;nbsp;New England Network for Women for a great evening Cocktails and Conversations at Om in Harvard Square, Cambridge. Meetups will be held in the main bar area on the second Monday of every month. The venue has great signature cocktails and a really nice, elegant atmosphere that make it easy to relax and connect. It also has a terrific Monday special (which was taken advantage of by many): 6 Asian-style dumplings (called "momos") and a cocktail for only $10! While parking can be a bit challenging in Harvard Square, it's very easy to get to via the Red Line or by bus from various areas outside the city, including Arlington, Watertown and most of Somerville/Cambridge. See you there! .&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll be hanging out in the bar/lounge area.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noona Joseph</member_name><member_id>5632804</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dani Nordin</member_name><member_id>9645963</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352929223000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newenglandnetworkforwomen-com</urlname><id>1463004</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>New England Network for Women :: Cambridge</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>36</yes_rsvp_count><created>1342114340000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>New England Network for Women Cambridge Cocktails &amp; Conversations Monthly Meetup</name><id>qppxkcyqpbqb</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1352763000000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newenglandnetworkforwomen-com/events/73066302/</event_url></item>
