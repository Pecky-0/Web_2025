A savings of $4 each. It's definitely looking pretty dang funny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It plays Nov 5th, 6th, 12th, 13th at 8 and 2PM on Nov 14. We can reserve tickets by calling the Shea. More info at &lt;a href="http://countryplayers.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://countryplayers...&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Play Synopsis&lt;br /&gt;Here is a wild farce with twists of fate, sight gags, mistaken identities and hilarious comic lines. Jon Trachtman and Leslie Arthur are out of work musicians who room together in New York City. To save money, Jon has been filing tax returns listing the pair as a married. The day of reckoning comes when the Internal Revenue Service informs the &amp;quot;couple&amp;quot; they're going to be investigated by a Mr. Spinner. Leslie masquerades as a housewife, aided by Jon's fiancee, Kate. Complicating matters further Leslie and Kate are having an affair behind Jon's back, Jon's mother drops in unexpectedly to meet her son's fiancee, and Leslie's ex girlfriend shows up demanding to know why Leslie has changed and won't see her anymore. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeanne</member_name><member_id>3778047</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289769123000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-458</urlname><id>228874</id><group_lat>41.9900016785</group_lat><group_lon>-72.5699996948</group_lon><name>Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287358508000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Play: Love, Sex and the IRS</name><id>15140624</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289761200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-458/events/15140624/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/8/global_18825656.jpeg</photo_url></item>
