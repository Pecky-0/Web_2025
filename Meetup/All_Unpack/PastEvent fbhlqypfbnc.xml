Earn exclusive rewards as you gain Renown Points for accomplishments made during each season!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;March of the Phantom Brigade &lt;/em&gt;is  an exciting 13-week season that finds the characters facing off against  an ancient evil in an effort to save a newly-founded frontier community  from its depredations! If you&amp;rsquo;re into D&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s storied legacy, you&amp;rsquo;ll  note the nods to classic locales such as the Ghost Tower and Castle  Inverness. If you&amp;rsquo;re just starting your 4th Edition experience, D&amp;amp;D  Encounters is a great place for you to get your weekly D&amp;amp;D fix as  you learn the game. Characters begin at 3rd level and advance normally,  so you can jump in anytime and you won&amp;rsquo;t be  overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who played in Season 3, you can carry over any magic items you found during that adventure and you have a one time opportunity to completely remake your character at 3rd level using any official 4e rules.&amp;nbsp; There is no limitation on Essentials or Core 4e material, so make the character you want to play and join us for another thrilling season of Encounters.&amp;nbsp; Glory tier awaits...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have friends or family interested in D&amp;amp;D and looking for a great introduction to what 4th edition has to offer, have them come and join us for an evening of adventure at Veteran's Gaming in Warwick.  Sessions will start at 6PM and should run from 2-3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who played in Seasons 1, 2, or 3, Rewards Cards earned in those adventures are fully legal for use in all subsequent seasons.&amp;nbsp; This season also includes the use of Fortune Cards, which will be on sale at Veteran's for those who are interesting in giving their character that extra edge to turn the tide of battle.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tanios</member_name><member_id>4187193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301699925000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1297175712000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D Encounters Season 4:  March of the Phantom Brigade</name><id>fbhlqypfbnc</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1301522400000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/16569490/</event_url></item>
