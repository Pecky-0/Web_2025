Just a reminder this is a two day event, October 31st and November 1st.  If you are interested in carpooling send me an e-mail with BVS CARPOOLING in the title and I will try to coordinate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello Boston Vegetarian Society, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 14th Annual Boston Vegetarian Food Festival is 9 days away! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will fill the Reggie Lewis Athletic Center with foods, products, and information that promote veggie living and help make it fun, delicious, and easy to live a healthy, eco- and animal-friendly life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * We ask for your help in publicizing this free event on Facebook, blogs, and with flyers and banners found on our website at www.BostonVeg.org/foodfest &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* We've gotten a nice promo on boston.com : &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/thingstodo/gallery/fairsandfests?pg=12" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.boston.com...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* We were featured with a little write-up and photo in the October Saveur magazine! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* South End News favored us with a kind article: &lt;a href="http://www.mysouthend.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;amp;sc=&amp;amp;sc2=news&amp;amp;sc3=&amp;amp;id=97682" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mysouthend...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Here is a fun short video taken at last year's Festival by Gardenburger. It reminds us of the good energy and good tasting that lies 9 days ahead! &lt;a href="http://gardenburger.com/Oasis.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;http://gardenburger.c...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Our organizing committee member David has 30 minutes of radio time to talk about the Festival and veg*m this Sunday, 6:45 - 7:15 AM at 98.5 FM. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It has been heartening to see the flow of volunteers who are offering help at the event. If you'd like to pitch in for a couple of hours, send us a note via&lt;a href="http://www.bostonveg.org/foodfest/contact.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonveg....&lt;/a&gt;  See you soon, we hope, and please bring some non-veg friends to the Festival! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizing Committee&lt;br /&gt;Boston Vegetarian Food Festival&lt;br /&gt;617-424-8846&lt;br /&gt;www.BostonVeg.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin</member_name><member_id>7947968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1261469441000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Vegetarian/Vegan Enthusiast</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood</urlname><id>1312890</id><group_lat>41.8199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Rhode Island Vegetarian and Vegan Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256464285000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>UPDATE: 14th Annual Boston Vegetarian Food Festival </name><id>11705032</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1257030000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Vegan-Vegetarian-Organic-RawFood/events/11705032/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/2/global_9211362.jpeg</photo_url></item>
