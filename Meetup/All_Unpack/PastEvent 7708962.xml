Many more people are engaged in the presidential election than in decades. People say this is the most interesting and engaged election they've experienced in their lifetime. At the same time, more and more of the American people -- nationally, 35-40% -- are calling themselves &amp;quot;independent.&amp;quot; Here in &lt;b&gt;MASS 49%&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of our voters&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;are registered independent&lt;/b&gt;. And now, independents are getting organized! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on over and let's eat and talk. We are looking to do these casual conversations every month. So, if you can't make this one, please let me know if you would be opened to another one.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one answering the door with a HUGE SMILE :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane</member_name><member_id>4305566</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208876853000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Independent's are having a big impact on the presidential elections.
