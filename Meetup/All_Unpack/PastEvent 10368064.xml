Let me start by apologizing for not being able to accommodate everyone's needs.  There was quite a mix of feedback, from people who preferred to have meetups late in the day to those that were coming out of town and suggested moving to a location outside of Boston.  I'm certainly open to mixing things up to involve different people/dogs, so if this next meetup doesn't work for you, stay tuned!  I just wanted to get something organized to bring this meetup back to life sooner rather than later, but will continue to explore options for times/locations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year we had a couple of meetups at Peter's Park, so let's try that again.  Rob of Doggie Day has generously offered to continue to host this meetup, so I anticipate going back to Doggie Day on future occasions assuming scheduling works out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please let me know if you'll be able to attend and please do continue to provide your feedback on a regular basis.  Looking forward to seeing you on May 31st! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marjie and Pumpkin&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marjie</member_name><member_id>3703648</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246202725000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Maltese Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>maltese-115</urlname><id>215542</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Downtown Boston Maltese Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241795198000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Downtown Boston Maltese May Meetup - Let's Turn This Puppy Around!</name><id>10368064</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243782000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/maltese-115/events/10368064/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/6/global_8449718.jpeg</photo_url></item>
