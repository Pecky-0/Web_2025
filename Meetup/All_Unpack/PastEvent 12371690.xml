YES IT DIIIIID!!  But not so much here as up at Windblown, so we're going there on Saturday.  (Great Brook looks to be pretty sad by Saturday with local temps above freezing all week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Windblown is CASH OR CHECK ONLY NO CREDIT CARDS.  They rent all types of gear.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We meet to start skiing at 10:00 in front of the lodge by the ski rack, so be there ahead of time to buy your trail pass and get ready.  It takes 90 minutes to get there from Boston so leave plenty of time.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have excellent snow shoeing, for anyone who wants to do that, with marked snowshoe only trails.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the guy in the Santa hat.....</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jack Costello</member_name><member_id>8010199</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>11</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1266077397000</updated><rating><average>4.17999982834</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>Cross-Country Skiers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1330889</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Cross-Country Skiing and Snowshoe Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263999650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Windblown Saturday</name><id>12371690</id><headcount>27</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264258800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Cross-Country-Skiing-Meetup-Group/events/12371690/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/6/7/global_6511383.jpeg</photo_url></item>
