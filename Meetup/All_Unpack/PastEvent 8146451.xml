Except for a short pass over a rock outcrop, the well-maintained, clearly marked path remains relatively flat.&lt;br /&gt;- the forested shore offers a sense of relaxing isolation.&lt;br /&gt;- boardwalks help keep feet dry.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my poor sense of direction I have yet to do this trail. I've had the pleasure of finding the Smith Pond trail while getting lost and have gone back and biked other trails in the Smith Pond area.&lt;br /&gt;Smith Pond is really a big Marsh with lots of wildlife birds? not so great for puppies swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The park charges a nominal fee per car - I think it's $3.00&lt;br /&gt;We could car pool if anyone is interested. Kindly let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;DIRECTIONS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; from Deerfield Rd it is 6.3 miles to the Public Campground. SET your mileage meter when you turn onto Deerfield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn onto Deerfield Rd you will see signs within a quarter of a mile, the first of which indicates that all visitors must stop and check in (that's the nominal fee and you get a map too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 3 to 3.1 miles you will be taking a RIGHT, directly after an old cemetary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 3.3 miles (so .2 miles later) take a LEFT turn for the public campground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow for 3 miles to the campground and you will see the check in lodge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo &amp;amp; I will be there to let you know where to park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; anyone interested in carpooling from Manchester or en route Please EMAIL me ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;My car can host 2-3 people, plus Hugo &amp;amp; 2-3 smaller dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: deeppink"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meetup is at 10 am at the campground entrance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>LOOK for: Green Volvo Wagon EPRINT plates Near lodge at the Public Campground</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine</member_name><member_id>4894798</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1214316432000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213538217000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bear Brook State Park - Beaver Pond</name><id>8146451</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1214143200000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/8146451/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/3/6/global_4493430.jpeg</photo_url></item>
