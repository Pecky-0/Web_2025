<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm hosting a game event at my place on Black Friday. If you have the day off and you are not spending your entire day shopping, join us for some fun and games. I have a number of strategy games that I would like to bring to the game table. It is a BYOL (Bring Your Own Leftovers) event. For those with no leftovers, there are plenty of restaurants in the area to order take-out. It will be an open house style. Let me know when you plan to arrive so I have a general idea when to expect you. Email me if you need directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jeremy</member_name><member_id>13693585</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353731600000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1353430748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Games and Leftovers</name><id>92180692</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>34200000</duration><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353697200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/92180692/</event_url></item>
