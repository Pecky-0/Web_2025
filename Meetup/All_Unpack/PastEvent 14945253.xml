Turn back when you want and and enjoy lunch - please bring something to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;Where to meet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;There is a bike parking lot as you enter Colt Park about 1/8 mile in on the left. The trail is right there. If it's full, drive about 1/4 miles further, after bearing left at the fork, and park at the next lot on the left.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;Colt State Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in Bristol is often referred to as the 'gem' of the State Parks System. The entire western border of the park is an open panorama onto Narragansett Bay. Open year round, the park offers four miles of bicycle trails passing along the Bay and through 464 acres of groomed fruit trees, carefully nurtured flowering bushes, and manicured lawns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: teal"&gt;East Bay Bike path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a 14.5 mile, 10 foot wide, ribbon of asphalt that provides a safe place for unobstructed cycling. Users can enjoy the sights, sounds and smells as the path takes them by coves and marshes, over bridges, and through State Parks.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Deb</member_name><member_id>5999051</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1286893991000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Funseeker</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>nefunseekers</urlname><id>1277691</id><group_lat>42.0299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5299987793</group_lon><name>Funseekers!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285808420000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bike or Blade</name><id>14945253</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286811000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nefunseekers/events/14945253/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/e/global_18357406.jpeg</photo_url></item>
