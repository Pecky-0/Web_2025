Join us for dinner at the Royal Buffet in Manchester, and then if you'd like we can check out a movie afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buffet has everything to offer, from American, Italian, Chinese, steak, seafood, barbecue, seafood, and more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.restaurantway.com/?restaurant=2745&amp;amp;view=restaurant" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.restaurant...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some great movies coming out before or on Christmas day: I'm thinking about seeing Sherlock Holmes which is opening that day, but there are other interesting movies (such as Avatar) that we can go see as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE: Sherlock Holmes will be starting at 7:40PM. Since this is opening day for this movie, I recommend that you get tickets ahead of time to ensure that you get a seat since it may sell out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to meet just for the movie, I am meeting everyone in the theatre lobby, by the entrance of Chatters at 7:25.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you don't have to attend both events: join us just for dinner, or just for the movie. Just let me know which event you're going to attend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet by the front door-I look like my picture and I'll place a "Meetup" Sign on the table</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1262049614000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Mixing-it-Up</urlname><id>768057</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7300033569</group_lon><name>MIXING IT UP IN WEST HARTFORD AND BEYOND</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260312891000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner and a Movie: Christmas Day</name><id>12047068</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1261782000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Mixing-it-Up/events/12047068/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/a/5/global_2981797.jpeg</photo_url></item>
