He even used them with his patients in psychoanalysis. Cards can be useful tools in dream interpretation, stimulating the imagination, exploring the unconscious, as well as inducing dream states and dream recall. Cards can also be used for guidance, foretelling the future, answering your questions, and understanding the meaning of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Meetup, Deerheart will share how he uses cards in his own dreamwork, initiating dream states, as well as interpreting his dreams and waking visions. He will also lead the group in a game using dream cards. Various dream cards, oracle cards, animal cards, and fortune telling cards will be used as examples. If you have have a set of cards, you are encouraged to bring them. Come and learn what's in the cards for you!&lt;/p&gt;
