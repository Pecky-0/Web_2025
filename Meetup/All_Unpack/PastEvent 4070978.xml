<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We're joining forces with the Boston Web Design Meetup group this month and will be meeting at the Trident Cafe on Wednesday, March 2. It's sure to be a great time and will mean some new faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trident Cafe is easily accessible via the MBTA Green Line -- take the Hines stop and walk up Newbury Street. You'll see the Trident less than half a block up on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet other graphic designers, talk shop, network, and enjoy good food and good company. NOW also meet your counterparts in the web design field. Who knows what new alliances may emerge?&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Graphic Designers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>graphicdesign-39</urlname><id>71144</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Graphic Design Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1105666394000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Graphic Design March Meetup</name><id>4070978</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1109809800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/graphicdesign-39/events/4070978/</event_url></item>
