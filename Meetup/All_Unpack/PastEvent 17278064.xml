Her ambitious  husband, a nouveau riche stockbroker, drags her from one doctor to  another in search of a cure that will allow her to fulfill her many  social obligations without giving in to hysteria. They think they have  found the solution in charismatic neurologist Victor Seth, a champion of  a relatively new procedure called hypnotism. Seth sets about freeing  Lucy from the social constraints that have made her so unhappy,  encouraging her to pursue her artistic talents and explore her  sexuality. Seth convinces himself that his techniques, including his  handy way with an electrotherapy wand, are all in the name of science,  but even he is unprepared for the new Lucy who emerges--a passionate,  calculating, amoral creature of large appetites.
