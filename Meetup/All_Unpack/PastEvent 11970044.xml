Well, it's sort of a classic...at least it has some of the characters from the classic and the title is kind of the same. Aw hell, it's not really the classic, but it sounded good, didn't it? So, yes, by popular vote (only six people were there to vote, so if you want a say from now on, show up!) we're reading Pride....and Prejudice....and Zombies!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, come and see what happens when Elizabeth realizes the Mr. Darcy doesn't want to marry her, but wants to eat her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we're meeting after the holidays so that's why the date is Jan 6. We'll go back to our regular schedule in Feb. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same 12 person cap applies so RSVP as soon as you can. And, as a reminder, if you RSVP as a yes, but can't make it, please update your RSVP asap so someone else can join.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're going to meet at UnWined in Manchester at 7pm. The fondue there is to die for, by the way. Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1262995620000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259450391000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Moving back to the classics.....sort of...</name><id>11970044</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262822400000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/11970044/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
