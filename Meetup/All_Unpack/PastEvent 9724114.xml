<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>As part of our Walking With Giants series, Richard Dale-Mesaros will interview Matt Dupee, a local, seasoned real estate investor.  For the last 15 years, Matt Dupee has been investing in real estate in just about every county in the state.  Most of his deals have been single family homes bought at public auction.  Matt will discuss how he prepares for an auction (in particular, how he assesses the condition of the property and determines resale value) and reveal tips that he's learned along the way.  He'll share great stories of how he bought numerous houses with ever setting foot inside first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:  6:30 pm, March 11, 2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:  The Best Western Executive Court, 13500 South Willow Street, Manchester&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:  Members - free; Guests - $20 per meeting&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bernadette</member_name><member_id>4477491</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne Shvanda</member_name><member_id>7024028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1239228177000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestate-756</urlname><id>633261</id><group_lat>42.9399986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>NH Entrepreneurs Networking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234399093000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The New Hampshire Real Estate Investors Association March Meetup</name><id>9724114</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236810600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/realestate-756/events/9724114/</event_url></item>
