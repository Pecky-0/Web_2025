Located on Cambridge St on &amp;quot;the other side&amp;quot; of Beacon Hill, this little place aims to please.  The food is all good, as are the wines, and the service too.  Entrees are $19 - 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pierrotbistrot.com/hours.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.pierrotbis...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is difficult.  If you can, take the T and get off at Charles St.  It's only a few blocks up Cambridge St.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE!  Don't believe the map that is linked at the top of this page.  It would have you go to Chestnut Hill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you must cancel, be sure to do so by internet at least twelve hours in advance, or else by phone (781)643-0130. Please don't be a no-show as there are consequences, and not just to your kharma.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The restaurant is small, but can always ask the hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Harold</member_name><member_id>5109349</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1202344877000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><why>The Pierrot Bistrot serves amazing French food at great prices.
