Probably for many of us.  The inventory of available properties in my investment areas is very tight right now.  Lots and lots under agreement, few actives.   I am busy looking for the next one!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will bring before and after pictures of both the properties I am doing now.  And invite all of you to do the same.  Put them on a disc and we can all see them.  I will have my laptop and projector with me.  I have office 2007, so any office powerpoint format will work.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim and I attended Robyn thompson's 5 day bootcamp a week ago.  Very good info.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For investors, it is still pretty tight and requires a heavy % of cash in.  Money out refis are hard to come by, too.  For my property, there were REO restrictions that caused more obstacles and challenges.  It's a dance out there, but when we learn the basic steps, it can be done.  I will be sharing how it is working for me.  I wnet hard money on one, cash on the other one.  First sale set for 5/28- going to market next week I hope on the second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's plan, too, to talk about the real estate market, the impact of the stimulus package, and what projects and plans you are into.  I am looking forward to a great conversation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm regards,&lt;br /&gt;Annie&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come in and go down the stairs to our meeting room on the lower level.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246560464000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>New Normal RE Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>GreaterBostonREIClub</urlname><id>320990</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Real Estate Investing Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239063317000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Greater Boston Real Estate Investing Club May Meetup</name><id>10131010</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241478000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/GreaterBostonREIClub/events/10131010/</event_url></item>
