We will paddle from East Brimfield Lake to Holland Pond and back, about 3+ hours of paddling. Bring a snack, we'll get out and stretch at Holland Pond before heading back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paddle is through the area that was hit by the tornado last year. You will see a lot of damage but the trees have been cleared out of the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people at this ramp that check equipment for all boats. Do not forget your life jacket and whistle. To get there - From the Mass Pike to Rt. 20 West - Stay on Rt. 20 through the center of Sturbridge. About 1/2 mile after the intersection of Rt. 20 and 148 (stay on Rt. 20), there will be a brown sign on the left saying "East Brimfield Dam", and then shortly after that on the right is another brown sign with a picture of a boat ramp, the entrance to the ramp area is on the right shortly after the ramp sign. When you get down to the parking lot, the sign says "Long Pond / East Brimfield Lake". From Rt. 20 East - Go over the lake, and the entrance to the boat ramp is the first left after you go over the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unload your boat then park your car up the little hill on the other side of the gate.  The few spots on the right below the gate are for boats with trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you interested in a bite to eat after paddling I am stopping off at B.T.'s.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan L</member_name><member_id>7773139</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1339930708000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddling-33</urlname><id>505356</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>The Worcester Paddling Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1338744607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>East Brimfield Lake</name><id>67544882</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1339853400000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddling-33/events/67544882/</event_url></item>
