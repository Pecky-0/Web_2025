For those of you new to ohanami, it's the long-established tradition of cherry blossom viewing in Japan, where people can relax, eat, and drink under the beautiful cherry trees located all over Japan.  We also have cherry trees spread throughout Boston (many donated by Japan), so why not join us for own ohanami picnic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please watch this section carefully since we are contending with rain this weekend.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As of now, we will be meeting on Sunday, but if we get rained out, we will plan on the next weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location/Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet near the bridge that crosses the pond with the swan boats ('Meeting Place Option 1' on the map).  Please look for signs on the trees where we will be located.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mit.edu/~rschuman/boston_publ_gardens_map.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mit.edu/~r...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to Bring:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some type of food or drink, whether it's something homemade or bought from the store.
