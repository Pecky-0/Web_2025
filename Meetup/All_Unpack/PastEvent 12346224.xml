We'd been off the stage for some time, and it was great to return with more improvisational ammunition. After briefly discussing the show, we'll work on reloading our ammo during this rehearsal, through new warmups, drills, and a whole new set of games--yes, our own personal Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our game repertoire has withstood the test of time, but now it's time to freshen things up. If we settle into the comfortable, we do a disservice to the craft. Of course, all the skills we've practiced to this point will still apply, and we'll be attuned to ensure they don't wither away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please think about two things before coming: (1) how can I build on what the previous person said? (2) how can I get outside of my head?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's look forward to a fun day!&lt;br /&gt;Harish&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the lobby.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Hari</member_name><member_id>8057923</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1275587848000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>laughingmatter</urlname><id>1386175</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Great Boston Chapter of Laughing Matter - Auditions Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263768598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ensemble A Rehearsal</name><id>12346224</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264379400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/laughingmatter/events/12346224/</event_url></item>
