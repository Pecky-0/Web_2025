(late) &lt;br /&gt;and Janice (maybe)) will be coming from the north... would you &lt;br /&gt;like to move the &amp;quot;simple spaghetti dinner&amp;quot; to Bob/Rob's place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure..i can do that....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked it over w/ Bob and he'd be fine/prefer that.  If so, &lt;br /&gt;feel free to update your posting, requesting people MapQuest &lt;br /&gt;directions to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;123 Saint Augustine Street&lt;br /&gt;West Hartford, CT  06110&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;done....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please request they RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; by 4:30 on your site, so I'll &lt;br /&gt;know how much spahgetti, sauce, salad and Italian bread to pick &lt;br /&gt;up.   If you've already picked some of these items up, feel &lt;br /&gt;free to bring them, but let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I bring the big spag pot.....also i bring the sause in the jar (3-4 jars of variety) and the parmesean chez..not enough time to make a real pot of good sause stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have all been overdoing the partying and many are going &lt;br /&gt;kayaing in the morning, so it'll be a low-key, early evening.  &lt;br /&gt;We can have a fire pit in our back yard.  I think Laura Z will &lt;br /&gt;likely come to, from Middletown.  Probably don't want to have &lt;br /&gt;too many, however.  If it suddenly get's a lot of people, we &lt;br /&gt;can take up a collection, or ask people to post what they'd &lt;br /&gt;like t bring.&lt;br /&gt;its a late posting , i dont think many would go..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Na there are so many other things going on on friday..not many want to spend time with us geezers, they want to go to the loud bars...and dance wishing for romance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT intended to &amp;quot;steal your thunder&amp;quot; in any way, and &lt;br /&gt;we'd all be fine coming to your place.
