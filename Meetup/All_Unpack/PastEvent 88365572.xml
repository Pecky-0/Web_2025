&lt;p&gt;You Cannot reserve seats at the Tupelo, but we will all meet in the parking lot and go in together so we can sit together. This has always worked well in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have dinner before at a local establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic in sound and kaleidoscopic in vision, the eclectic Martha's Vineyard-based six-piece Entrain has been thrilling critics and fans alike since its inception. Entrain has recorded eight albums (one this year), all of which have been praised for their ability to shift effortlessly between musical styles - from rock, blues, calypso and ska, to zydeco, jazz and funk - often within the same song. "The whole Entrain concept is based around the drums and infectious rhythms. Once we've got that.... anything goes, everything goes," explains Tom Major (drummer). As Sam Holmstock (conga/djembe/trombonist) says, " &lt;br /&gt;

 The most important thing that we try to do with our music is bring everybody together in the spirit of peace, love, fun and a ton of drums!"&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>gary smith</member_name><member_id>12959175</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1353730472000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>fun folks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dance-342</urlname><id>462174</id><group_lat>42.75</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4899978638</group_lon><name>Dance &amp; Activities Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1351093319000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>ENTRAIN at the Tupelo</name><id>88365572</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1353718800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dance-342/events/88365572/</event_url></item>
