It was great and we're going to go again this Sunday so if you couldn't make it last week... &lt;br /&gt;

 Rumney has great sport climbing where it's easy to set up top ropes too. If you have a rope please say so and bring it. We need ropes! Also, bring lead/trad gear if you want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a good site for info on climbing at Rumney: &lt;a href="http://mountainproject.com/v/rumney/105867829"&gt;http://mountainproject.com/v/rumney/105867829&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's meet in the large Rumney parking lot, at the picnic tables, near the info board where you pay for parking ($3), at 9am. Please be punctual. Rumney is a two hour drive from Boston so please plan your departure accordingly. I anticipate being out until about 4-5pm, but this is flexible depending on weather and fun level.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty easy to find if you've never been. Head up 93 and take exit 26 for NH-25/3A towards Rumney. Merge onto NH-3AS/Tenney Mtn Hwy and go about 4 miles to a large traffic circle, stay right and take the first exit onto NH-25W. After about 3.5 miles turn right onto Main st. Go about 0.7 miles and turn left onto Buffalo Rd by a white church. Rumney parking lot will be on the right about a mile down Buffalo Rd. Copy and paste this into google maps: 43.801905,-71.830019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please post in your rsvp if you will be bringing a rope and/or other gear (quickdraws, anchor building gear, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dogs, no babies. Crags are not a good place for either of these creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required gear: Harness, belay device, climbing shoes, something to eat, water. ROPE if you have it please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helmets are a good idea too. You are responsible for your own safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there is a decent outhouse at the parking lot. Relax.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334580483000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>South-Shore-Rock-Climbers</urlname><id>1496386</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>South Shore Rock Climbers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334014205000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Climbing Rumney</name><id>59899632</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334494800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/South-Shore-Rock-Climbers/events/59899632/</event_url></item>
