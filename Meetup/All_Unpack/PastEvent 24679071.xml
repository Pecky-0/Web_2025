[Leo's Place is next to CVS and across from The Garage.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us for an hour on Sunday morning (from 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM) inside this small restaurant. &amp;nbsp;It's a great opportunity to practice speaking in English, to make new friends from around the world and to learn about American culture as well as the cultures of your new international friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to bring some paper and a pen...there will be lots to learn!&lt;/p&gt;
