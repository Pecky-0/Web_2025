As some of you know, I can't do IMAX movies because I get migraines from them, so this one's gonna be organized by Gary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't like IMAX or can't make the movie on 12/3, we are going to see &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/calendar/15174912/"&gt;Harry Potter 7 on 12/9 (the following Thursday), so feel free to RSVP to that, as well.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No discount tickets, as it's a NoOrg and also it's not at the AMC. Buy your tickets ahead of time (I think you can get them online) to ensure you get a seat! It's sure to sell out. &lt;a href="http://jordans.com/Imax/Tickets.aspx"&gt;Begin your purchase here.&lt;/a&gt; Select Natick, then Future Schedules, then December 3, then Select, then 6:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts on 12/3 at 6:45, so meet Gary at the concession stand at 6:15. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary is hoping to cross-post this on his Social Fun meetup, so you may meet more people there from another meetup group! Gary will email people who have RSVPed yes the night before with last-minute&lt;br /&gt;details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the show! If you have questions about this meetup, don't ask me, as it's not my get-together. Ask Gary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291504188000</updated><rating><average>1.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290906337000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NoOrg: Harry Potter at the Jordan's Imax</name><id>15570387</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1291418100000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/15570387/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
