If you RSVP &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;, I'd suggest you buy tickets beforehand to avoid being shut out. Also, any &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; RSVPs will be changed to &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; by Wednesday, 12 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is &lt;a href="http://www.coolidge.org/bossofitall" target="_blank"&gt;the movie synopsis&lt;/a&gt; from Coolidge's website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Boston Globe, Ty Burr's review:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The Boss of It All &amp;quot; is about an out-of-work thespian hired to impersonate the CEO of a software company. A normal day in the life of a small-cap company , in other words. The movie's as attuned to Dilbert-level cubicle politics as it is to the pomp and absurdity of the actor's life, and if the Coolidge Corner didn't have dibs on it, I'd say the film should be required viewing at every offsite on or near the Route 128 high-tech corridor. It'll trash company morale but you'll go out laughing. Hollowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the director is Denmark's Lars von Trier , dogma theorist and perpetrator of such prankishly humorless sins against the arthouse as &amp;quot;Dogville &amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Idiots .&amp;quot; Who knew the man had a workplace comedy in him, let alone one this sharp?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;amp;id=9789" target="_blank"&gt;Rest of Ty Burr's review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931704.html?categoryid=31&amp;amp;cs=1&amp;amp;p=0" target="_blank"&gt;Another review&lt;/a&gt; from Variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The running time of the movie is 99 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the show starts at 7:40 PM and not 7:30 PM (one of the quirks of Meetup that allows time increments in 15 minutes only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be holding a sign after the movie right outside the screening room. Since it's a late show, instead of dinner afterwards, we'll meet at JP Licks across the street for ice-cream, tea, coffee and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;~Amit&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182036714000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1181608592000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>"The Boss of it All" at the Coolidge</name><id>5880691</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1181863800000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/5880691/</event_url></item>
