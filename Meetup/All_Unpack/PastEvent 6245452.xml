So, here's the meetup event for this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The word quagmire is frequently used to describe what's become of the current situation in Iraq. It implies a mess that's increasingly difficult to climb out of, a gradual sinking. That's not a word Donald Rumsfeld would have used. As one of the architects of that current situation, which began with an American military invasion in early 2003, he had a different idea of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the more telling moments in Charles Ferguson's bone-chilling new documentary, &amp;quot;No End in Sight,&amp;quot; when a reporter offers &amp;quot;quagmire&amp;quot; as an apt description, Rumsfeld takes umbrage. With the debonair assurance of an old Hollywood star, he says, &amp;quot;That's somebody else's word. I don't do quagmires.&amp;quot; Ferguson's film is a clear-sighted counterpoint to the former secretary of defense's impression. As the title suggests, it's a seemingly infinite mess.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;amp;id=9927" target="_blank"&gt;Full review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/movies/27sigh.html" target="_blank"&gt;Another review from NYT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes&lt;br /&gt;1. The actual movie time is 7:20pm. Meetup allows times in 15 minute increments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you RSVP &amp;quot;Maybe,&amp;quot; please update it to Yes/No by Tuesday as it's always helpful to have a correct count when making restaurant reservation. If the event is full, any &amp;quot;Maybe&amp;quot; RSVPs will be changed to &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; on Wednesday to allow others to RSVP &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://www.landmarktheaters.com/Market/Boston/Boston_Frameset.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Kendall Theater website&lt;/a&gt; (for directions, parking, ticket info).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the movie, Amit will be holding a meetup sign near the front row and then we're off to a nearby restaurant for food and discussion.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Green</member_name><member_id>1984564</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1188688568000</updated><rating><average>4.40000009537</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188143744000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>No End In Sight</name><id>6245452</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188515700000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/6245452/</event_url></item>
