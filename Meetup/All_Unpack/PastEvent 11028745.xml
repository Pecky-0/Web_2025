Mary Francis who is also a priest at the Boston Center of Light is teaching this workshop on &amp;quot;The Art of Meditation.&amp;quot; If you have any desire to grow spiritually and in consciousness, I recommend meditating. And this is truly an Art! This workshop will help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is more about the workshop:&lt;br /&gt;When we get still in our mind, we can draw close to the great source of peace and love. This &lt;br /&gt;seminar emphasizes the importance of learning to listen, without distraction, to that “still small &lt;br /&gt;voice” within through the practice of meditation. How does one come to this place in meditation of &lt;br /&gt;spiritual silence and stillness when our minds are filled with chaos and chatter? In this seminar, learn &lt;br /&gt;to quiet your mind and tap into a natural state of rest, peace, joy, and creativity &lt;br /&gt;that is possible for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>just ring the bell of front door; you can park across the street in the Montessori parking lot</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251415769000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1249352183000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August 8th Meditation workshop</name><id>11028745</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249774200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/11028745/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/8/8/global_1017208.jpeg</photo_url></item>
