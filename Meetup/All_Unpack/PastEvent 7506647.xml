<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Hi gang,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the 9 who showed up last meeting for a good discussion about the validity of mystical experience.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For April 14, we can discuss the topic of an upcoming debate at Harvard Law School, &amp;quot;Should criminal law be reconsidered in light of advances in neuroscience?&amp;quot;  The debate itself is April 7, 6pm at Harvard Law School, Pound Hall room 213, free and open to the public. There's a flyer about it &lt;a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/petrie-flom/PDFs/crimneuro_event.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The participants are cutting edge thinkers in the field, all basically naturalists but with very different ideas about how a naturalistic understanding of ourselves might impact criminal justice. How come, one wonders? Hope to see you at the debate, then at Z Square a week later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;twc  at  naturalism.org  &lt;br /&gt;617-480-8846  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General description of what we're about (this bit doesn't change from month to month):   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allies of Naturalism welcomes those interested in exploring a science-based, humanistic and progressive naturalism that can make a difference in our lives.  To see what's involved in being a humanistic and progressive naturalist (more or less), check out Naturalism.Org, centerfornaturalism.org and the Guide to Naturalism at &lt;a href="http://www.centerfornaturalism.org/descriptions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.centerforn...&lt;/a&gt;.       &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, naturalism shows our full connection to the world and others, leads to an ethics of compassion, and gives us far greater control over our circumstances.  We don't need anything supernatural either above us or inside us to lead moral and meaningful lives: nature is enough.  Naturalism is a viable alternative to faith-based worldviews such as traditional religions and new age philosophies, offering a set of ideas with positive personal and social consequences.      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The meetings offer a chance to meet fellow naturalists in an informal, relaxed setting, but with at least some structure.  That's to say that we'll try to have one or two topics suggested in advance for people to think about, and then discuss when we get together.  Ultimately the focus and format of the meetings will be determined by participants, but will certainly include time for socializing and networking.  Watch the discussion board for topic announcements and other details.  Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We'll meet at the round table downstairs in the alcove.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tom Clark</member_name><member_id>1910897</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1208386966000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Naturalists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>naturalism-1</urlname><id>231723</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Allies of Naturalism</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205194118000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Should neuroscience change criminal law?</name><id>7506647</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208214000000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/naturalism-1/events/7506647/</event_url></item>
