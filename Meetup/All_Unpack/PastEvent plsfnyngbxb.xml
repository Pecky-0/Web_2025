Stay on Shasta until it ends (about 1.2 miles) and take a left onto High Range Road. Stay on only short time, (about .3 miles) and take first street on right - Hickory Hill Drive. Go to the end of it and park .... trail head is right in front of where parking is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like it if we could meet a little ways away from parking - under the power lines - so the dogs don't interfere with others and we don't cause too much congestion in the surrounding neighborhood. The power lines are right before you get into the woods. There are some hills along the hikes and a few different trails to choose from on the way. The loop we've done before takes about about 1.5-2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Let's gather under the power lines so we don't crowd people out at the parking area or in the neighborhood.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tracey</member_name><member_id>8472167</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1271768963000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1268947248000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Musquash Sundays</name><id>plsfnyngbxb</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1271595600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/12926521/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/a/a/global_12965034.jpeg</photo_url></item>
