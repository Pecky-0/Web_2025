They are experts in designing and installing solar systems here in Maine and are in the process of opening up a branch in the Portland area. We will hear about available technology, costs, incentives, etc. for SOLAR HOT WATER SYSTEMS for your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 6:30 for potluck dinner as always...followed by the presentation for about 45-60 minutes starting around 7:00 or 7:15. We should be able to open it up to discussion and questions around 8:00 or shortly thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that we will have more attendance at this event than we can manage with a house meeting, so we will be meeting at Zero Station in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540635000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Advocates for Oil Awareness</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-169</urlname><id>113465</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1161028024000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Joint meetup/ SOLAR HOT WATER SYSTEMS</name><id>5202164</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1163547000000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-169/events/5202164/</event_url></item>
