If you are just looking for a basic karaoke joint, no frills, great song selection, neighborhood joint, with character and a few characters too, then this is the place. It's a small little neighborhood bar, that gets a good little cross section of patrons, but not a lot of karaoke singers, so if you like to sing and want an audience that appreciates your talents, then give Josie's a try. No long rotations, and you will sing multiple times. We have a great song selection, and we can make most anyone anyone sound good. Friendly and fun place to hang out. Hope to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344658088000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344433320000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Friday Night Karaoke @ Josies Place Everett</name><id>76850862</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344646800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/76850862/</event_url></item>
