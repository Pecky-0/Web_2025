Back then, seven children attended.  Every year since, I would buy more decorations, and host another Halloween party.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parties for the children grew and grew and grew wherefore I had to start having the parties in the main living areas of my house for I had up to 40+ children attend!  My collection of Halloween decorations grew and grew and grew too!  Thus I decorate my living room, kitchen, dining room and bathroom! Yes, bathroom!  Did I mention my front yard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my children are grown, I still continue to host an annual Halloween Party!  So please come and enjoy yourself, mingle, and meet new friends! Children that do come will be given a goody bag full of treats! (so let me know if your bringing a child).  They're may even be a treat for the adults unless it's a trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALL ARE WELCOME!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring a friend!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Significant others are welcome!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your Kids!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/tongue.gif' border='0' alt='tongue' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, if you prefer, come by yourself!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/laughing.gif' border='0' alt='laughing' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a dish to share!&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYOB for those that wish to indulge&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/devilish.gif' border='0' alt='devilish' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft drinks &amp;amp; coffee/tea will be provided!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOOD, DRINK, MUSIC, FUN &amp;amp; PRIZE FOR BEST COSTUME!&lt;/b&gt; Soooo&lt;b&gt; Don't forget to wear your Halloween Costume!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This event is hosted in conjunction with Bob Kahn, founder and organizer of Cape Cod Friends!&lt;/b&gt; Check out his site at &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cape-Cod-Friends/"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;  I do have a dog and cats so if your allergic, don't forget to take your allergy meds!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll open the door, or maybe........my alternate personality will depending on what I wear for a costume!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharon</member_name><member_id>8235187</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1256772349000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Girl-s-Just-Wanna-Have-Fun-Social-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1305818</id><group_lat>41.6500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-70.3000030518</group_lon><name>"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!"
