Friends, kids, and pets are welcome.  We'll probably walk out for about an hour, take a short break, then walk back (roughly 2 hour walk total unless the group is beat and wants to walk less).  We can go somewhere in town for lunch afterwards.  Make sure to bring water!  It can be windy down there so be prepared.  Rain cancels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 195 or 495 take Route 25 heading towards the Bourne Bridge.  Take exit 3 (last before bridge).  Once in the rotary, stay on the L to go past Ocean State Job Lot and turn R onto Main St. in Buzzards Bay.  Follow the street until the edge of town.  You will see the train bridge on your L; turn into the lot and park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will send out my cell number to Yes responders the day before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. Yes, I know it is Mother's Day.  My mom lives in Philly and is also currently visiting Vegas. :)&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet near the restrooms facing the canal.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Trina</member_name><member_id>2292253</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1242342286000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1414</urlname><id>1281351</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7099990845</group_lon><name>South Shore Hike, Bike &amp; Social Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1241585223000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Canal walk</name><id>10348888</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241967600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1414/events/10348888/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/7/global_6044183.jpeg</photo_url></item>
