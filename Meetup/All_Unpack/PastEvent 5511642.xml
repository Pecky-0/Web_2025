With all the warm weather this week, the paths should be clear and dry.  We will walk through the Arnold Arboretum , then head to the Bukhara Indian Bistro for lunch around noon.  From there, after lunch, it will be a 20 minute walk back to the Forest Hills station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet inside the Forest Hills subway station by the donut shop.  There is a pay parking lot at the station and free street parking nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/visitors/map.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.arboretum....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arnold Arboretum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arnold Arboretum is a park for both outdoor enjoyment and scientific exploration. North America's first public arboretum, it is owned by the City of Boston and leased to Harvard University for 1,000 years, beginning in 1882. The 265 acres of rolling land includes meadows, forest and ponds with 4,000 different varieties of woody plants and 14,000 trees, shrubs and vines along with world-renowned horticultural collections. &lt;br /&gt;Peter's Hill, the highest point in the Necklace, provides a glorious view of the Boston skyline. The Hunnewell Center has a visitors center and bookstore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bukhara Indian Bistro&lt;br /&gt;701 Centre St. &lt;br /&gt;Jamaica Plain, Boston &lt;br /&gt;617-522-2195 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On a bustling corner, this gilded, softly lit spot offers much more than the standard tandoori and vindaloo dishes. The real treat comes in Bukhara's foray into regional dishes, particularly those of southern India. Try the dosas -- huge, tangy, crispy crepes filled with meat and potatoes and accompanied by coconut chutney and lentil soup. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cuisine: Indian &lt;br /&gt;Prices: $10-$20. &lt;br /&gt;Price Range: Cheap (under $12) &lt;br /&gt;Hours: Daily 11 a.m.-11 p.m &lt;br /&gt;Credit Cards: Visa, Mastercard, American Express. &lt;br /&gt;Handicap access: No steps at front entrance, but access to lower-floor restroom requires a trip outside to a ramp. &lt;br /&gt;Good Choices: Masala dosa, pav bhaji, poori, tandoori chicken, murg tikka masala. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1174103394000</updated><rating><average>4.55999994278</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1172376839000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Arnold Arboretum walk</name><id>5511642</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1173022200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5511642/</event_url></item>
