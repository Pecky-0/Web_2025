<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This will be our first long-awaited meetup! I thought I'd wait until long after the confusion of the holidays. Since a lot of books and movies have been mentioned in our emails, I thought I'd make a book &amp;amp; movie list to post on the site. Perhaps more ideas on books &amp;amp; movies could be a topic of conversation? Otherwise this is not meant as a rigid discussion meetup but really a social event so we can meet eachother a talk about whatever comes to our metaphysical minds... However, my metaphysical mind is still having a hard time coming up with a physical place to meet! I'll update as soon as possible!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the Cafe with a bright blue &amp; green scarf around my neck.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Raina</member_name><member_id>4359513</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200856201000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People Interested in Metaphysics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>metaphysics-387</urlname><id>682186</id><group_lat>43.4399986267</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7600021362</group_lon><name>The New England Metaphysical Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197655530000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Meetup</name><id>6912825</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200265200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/metaphysics-387/events/6912825/</event_url></item>
