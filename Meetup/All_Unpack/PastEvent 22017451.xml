  &lt;p&gt;Let's celebrate the first day of summer with an early evening
  paddle at Whitehall. Please arrive in time to start paddling at
  6:15 PM.&amp;nbsp; When you come to Whitehall, be careful with
  directions. If you use your GPS for directions you will end up at
  a random spot on a side road. The boat launch is on Route 135
  between Hopkinton and Westborough Town Centers. The large parking
  lot for the boat launch is next to the intersection of Dale Road
  and Route 135 in Hopkinton.&amp;nbsp; Plan to spend about 2 hours on
  the water.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that most of the paddles I schedule are
  at Whitehall. I realize this might not be the most convenient
  spot for some of you, but, it is by far the largest and prettiest
  place to paddle in this area and there is usually plenty of
  parking.&amp;nbsp; Expect to see some paddles scheduled for Tully
  Lake in Royalston, MA and perhaps and ocean paddle somewhere on
  Buzzards Bay or Hingham Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
