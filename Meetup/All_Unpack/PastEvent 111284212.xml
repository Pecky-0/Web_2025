 &lt;br /&gt;

 Since I am going to Jamaica for a short vacation in mid April, I thought it would be good to get in the spirit a little early!  I've always loved Bob Marley and reggae in general and have been waiting to see this.  It's apparently the definitive, mother of all Bob documentaries, clocking in at nearly two and a half hours.  Unlike the plethora of knockoff CD compilations and video bootlegs of all things Bob Marley, this was actually authorized by and heavily produced in tandem with the living Marley family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is my hope that this will be your next best (and soonest) option to seeing the movie at your local megaplex during its theatrical run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Millbury - just off routes 146, 90, and 20 - and will disclose the address and my contact info in a private email to the members who sign up. ***EARLY START TIME*** due to length of movie. Please plan on arriving about 6:30 to get settled and chat a bit, and the movie starts at 7:00 sharp.  No early birds, please :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to bring munchies and/or beverages for yourself and/or others, but please do not feel obligated to do so.  The assumption should be that people will have eaten a proper meal before they come over, and if that's not the case then by all means bring whatever.  I will make it a point to always make fresh popcorn for these movie nights, but really I expect nothing in return besides a good time had by all.  I'll have unlimited Brita-filtered water, yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all 6 slots are taken up, I recommend jumping on the waiting list and marking your calendars, since we all know plans change for people and folks may back out last minute.  Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dan</member_name><member_id>41397892</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>2</waitlist_count><updated>1365265772000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1364383435000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Movie night at Dan's, tropical edition: Marley</name><id>111284212</id><headcount>5</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1365201000000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/111284212/</event_url></item>
