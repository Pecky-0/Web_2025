Reserve August 15th for a day of fun on the water in North Conway, NH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoist the Jolly Roger, don yer pirate garb and join us for a pirate themed great time on the Saco River!  (Ye can paddle or float/tube)!  We’ll get shuttled to the put in at approx 9:30am and take our sweet time coming back 11 miles to our vehicles.  The river is gentle &amp;amp; clean and great for swimming or practicing rolls/exits.  Waterguns/pumps are really good items to have on this trip.  No doubt you’ll be soaked by marauding pirates on this trip if ye be unarmed.  So pack yer hardtack, sunscreen, water or other beverages, and strap on a parrot.  We assemble the fleet at 9am!  Be sharp, lest ye wants to be soaked when we take to our boats.  Expect to be out on the water for approx 5 hours depending on how fast the party decides to move.  We’ll also have many chances and beaches to go ashore for the leg stretching, swimming, lunch and other activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ll meet at the Saco Canoe Rental Company and get geared up.  Those who want to rent canoes/kayaks/tubes can do so there; others who will bring boats can have them shuttled to the put in for about $15.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the # of people who RSVP yes, I may be able to negotiate some group discounts on rentals/shuttle fees.&lt;br /&gt;If you are renting, you will need to make a reservation – hit the website and get yourself setup in advance to speed our group prep and get on the water quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details to come!&lt;br /&gt;Questions?
