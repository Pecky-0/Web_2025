I will be wearing a badge so anyone who doesn't know me can recognize me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy tickets in advance, you can't use Fandango, the Kendall Square Cinema uses MOVIEFONE.  Please note, if you use this service, it doesn't sell actual printable tickets, but reservations for seats.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an action adventure movie called The Host.    Sounds like a fun monster flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A neglectful father suddenly regrets not spending as much time with his daughter as he should have when a hideous mutant beast emerges from South Korea's Han River and whisks her away. Although believing that his girl has been killed and eaten, the bad dad receives a mysterious phone call from her so he embarks on a dangerous expedition into a secretive military base to get her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get more information including a link to trailers go to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://movies.go.com/host/d852827/action" target="_blank"&gt;http://movies.go.com/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a limited release movie, so we won't be able to watch in our usual meetup location.  Instead we will be going to the Kendall Square Cinema.   There are a few restaurants in the area for after the show too.
