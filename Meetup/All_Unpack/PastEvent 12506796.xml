USE THIS (GOOGLE):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=everyman+bistro&amp;amp;sll=41.827938,-71.430101&amp;amp;sspn=0.03217,0.082483&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.842359,-71.427784&amp;amp;spn=0.032163,0.082483&amp;amp;z=14" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this writing there are 4 days, 8 hours, 50 mins and 4 seconds to go according to the official Super Bowl countdown clock. (Yes, I actually went to nfl.com for the FIRST time ever - lol!) Whether you're rooting for the Saints or Colts (or don't care at all) come down to Everyman Cafe, cheer your heart out, hang out with friends, and enjoy $2 Pabst drafts (they also have 19 other beers on tap - whew!), 1/2 price appetizers, watch the game and socialize! Afterall, really, isn't that what its all about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyman Bistro is located inside the American Locomotive Works off Valley Street on Iron Horse Way. This area of Valley Street is behind the Mall. If you take Promenade St. going away from the Mall and make a right on Dean (taking a left brings you to Federal Hill) and then make a left on Valley St. Look for the American Locomotive Works building. You can't miss the logo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game time is 6pm and the hype will begin before, so come at 5 or come at 6, come early, come late, but come on down for some fun, friends and good cheer! Please RSVP! If we get a large group, I'd like to give Everyman a head's up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more NFL info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/44" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nfl.com/su...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyman Bistro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.everymanri.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.everymanri...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a silver scarf, but you can't miss us!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
