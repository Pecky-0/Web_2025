And a secret too, for that matter. Bring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate George says: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;I started writing again because a friend of mine dared me to. She may be regretting that dare because now I make her read all my chapters! I try to write about things I have some experience with. I used to be a type-setter, paste-up tech and motorcycle safety instructor. I also worked in the housekeeping department of a swank hotel. So that’s why Bree does those things. I’ve also been an actor, answering service operator, assistant to the dean of a medical school, instructional assistant, computer instructor and a number of other unremarkable jobs. So I have plenty of fodder for upcoming novels.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that I really want to write about being a back-up singer and I don’t know a thing about it… We’ll have to wait and see if I let that stop me or not!&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: indigo"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sold out, SRO opening season massmouth‘s series continues this year with slams at Kennedy’s Midtown, 42 Province Street, a short walk from Park Street T stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Seating &amp;amp; sign up start at 6:30pm.
