To help herself get over the loss, the deeply distraught mother commissions the famous artist Max Hollander to paint a portrait of Alexander based on photographs of the boy, together with his sister Lilli. Lilli herself has her own problems. A talented 22-year-old dance and voice student, she loses the chance to dance a principal role when she gets into a fight with her teacher. She also has problems with her boyfriend, an artist she clings to a bit too much. And finally she thinks her mother's plan to hang her brother as &amp;quot;decoration&amp;quot; on the wall is ridiculous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the encounter with the much older artist Lilli begins to win back her self-confidence. Max is drawn ever deeper into the complex, emotionally charged network of the family. Personal losses in the painter's own life have left painful traces in him too. Together Max and Lilli begin to come to terms with their past. &lt;br /&gt;Oscar winning director Caroline Link adapted Boston author Scott Campbell's book for her new film. A true story of lives put profoundly asunder and of the power of the creative process to begin to put them back together again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for 12 years and older&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;based on Aftermath by Scott Campbell&lt;br /&gt;dir.
