<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This is a fundraising event for a man that Bob and Kevin in the band graduated with from Burlington High. He was badly hurt in an accident when someone sideswiped his vehicle. Funds will help defray his medical expenses. A $30.00 tax deductible donation is payable at the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new venue and a really nice location for Four on the Floor at the Cafe Escadrille, easily accessible from 128 and Route 3. A nice place to meet, socialize and enjoy a fun group. The band is scheduled to play 7-11 PM and will likely be in the function room not the restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1238368471000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
