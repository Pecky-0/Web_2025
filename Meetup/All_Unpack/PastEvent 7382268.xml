We have the whole room to ourselves and the owner does a great job of making us feel welcome.  With the casual atmosphere it is the perfect location to socialize.  The food and drinks are affordable and there's plenty of room for us.   We would like to alternate nights of the week (to accommodate those with custody days).  Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>When you come in look for me.  (My picture is in my profile).  The back room that we usually have is reserved for another group so we will be in the front main area.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206140925000</updated><rating><average>4.17000007629</average><count>6</count></rating><why>Get out and socialize with friends old and new.</why><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1203642354000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group March Meeting</name><id>7382268</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1205967600000</time><rsvp_limit>40</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/7382268/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/2/global_3300034.jpeg</photo_url></item>
