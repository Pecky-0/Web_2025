Afterwards, we'll take one of the walking tours around Boston, to be announced. A little touristy, I know, but should still be fun. If it looks like the weather's going to be bad that day, a new activity will be posted asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* All the guided tours I checked either start in May or are extremely expensive. So here's what we're going to do: take a free Mp3 audio tour! Go to &lt;a href="http://www.bostonharborwalk.com/audio_tour/downtown.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonharb...&lt;/a&gt; and download the Mp3 to your iPod or Mp3 player of choice. If you don't have one, that's okay, we'll fill you in. I get the feeling we'll mostly be chatting with each other anyways, and we can go at our own pace. We'll start whenever we can walk after filling up on sushi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I shamelessly stole the idea from another meetup... but at least it's a different tour!)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207584751000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Asian Professionals</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Asian-Professionals</urlname><id>431528</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Greater Boston Asian Professionals Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205875263000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sushi and a Tour</name><id>7558302</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207411200000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Asian-Professionals/events/7558302/</event_url></item>
