&lt;p&gt;If there is surf, we can go surfing. If there is no surf, maybe we can rent sup's, lay out on the beach, or get some sun and play some beach frisbee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shall we meet in NH at Zapstix? This will give us a lot of options, if some people would like to rent a surfboard, SUP, or have a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;please specify in your rsvp if you would like to rent a surfboard (rental only), or if you would like a lesson so I can tell the shop. if you've got your own gear, your all set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;looking forward to some fun in the sun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** almost forgot - this also coincides with the Salisbury surf art festival...so maybe we can head to salisbury later in the day to check out some cool artwork. (make sure and bring quarters for this...salisbury is meter only and hasn't upgraded to credit cards yet)&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Denise</member_name><member_id>11388242</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1310276640000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Surfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>surfing-69</urlname><id>737305</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Surfing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1309963862000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>beach day</name><id>24746451</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1310220000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/surfing-69/events/24746451/</event_url></item>
