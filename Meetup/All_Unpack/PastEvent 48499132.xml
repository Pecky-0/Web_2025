Too frustrated with Brown Bag Bingos or Monthly Challenges to take a picture? How about taking some pictures in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Provident Bank&amp;rsquo;s Hampton Lobby for the Arts presents an exhibit of photographs by members of the NH Art Association's Photo Group - incl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;uding local artists Kristin Burchsted, Mark Esterly, John Hauschildt, Ken Kartes, Dick Lord, Eva Powers, Mike Sterling, Lin Wickett, and Tom Wright. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The works will be on display December 10, 2011 through March 3, 2012, 8am&amp;ndash;7pm M&amp;ndash;F, 9am&amp;ndash;1pm Saturdays, and 10am&amp;ndash;2pm Sundays at the Provident Bank&amp;rsquo;s Hampton branch. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The public is invited to an Artist&amp;rsquo;s Reception on Thursday, January 26, 2012 from 5:30-7:00pm at The Provident Bank, 321 Lafayette Road, Hampton. Light hors d&amp;rsquo;oeuvres and refreshments will be served. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Judging from past Lobby for the Arts receptions, Provident Bank puts on a great reception for these events. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

The Provident Bank&amp;rsquo;s Lobby for the Arts program is an ongoing series of local art exhibits, placed in each of The Provident Bank lobbies. The Bank receives no commissions for artwork sold and pays all expenses associated with the exhibit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come into the bank, we'll be the best looking ones ;)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>4289009</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1327684615000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Photography Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastPhotographers</urlname><id>1528260</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast Photographers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326832814000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yet Another Gallery Opening</name><id>48499132</id><headcount>50</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1327617000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastPhotographers/events/48499132/</event_url></item>
