It's a chance to hear true stories of death, crime and misery. The first one will be given on Saturday, May 1st (and then every Saturday after that until the end of October) at 5:30pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this walk through Boston's North End, you will hear about the dangers of Ann and Richmond Streets, the scourges of smallpox and influenza, the vandalization of the Royal Governor's House, the Molasses Flood, the infamous Brink's Job, along with a touch of organized crime, all against the backdrop of Boston's oldest neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crime, disease, death, and disaster... what better way to enjoy a pleasant evening in Boston??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tour costs $12 (or it's free for card-carrying members of Boston By Foot). Boston By Foot membership is available for reasonable costs and entitles you to all of the tours on the regular schedule for free.
