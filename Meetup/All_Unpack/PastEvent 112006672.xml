&lt;p&gt;As you know, the Boston Red Sox will no longer be playing Sweet Caroline during the 7th inning stretch. In Tandem with overhauling the team, the Red Sox are committed to re-energizing the fan experience. At this seasons home opener, the recently launched Talent in Transition Office (TiTO) will be unveiling the new fan friendly entertainment between innings: The Red Sox Cheerleaders! In a recent email from TITO, the Natives were asked to assist in finding some fans who would like to join the home game cheer squad at Fenway and be an on field cheerleader for a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Boston Red Sox have the most passionate and loyal baseball fans in the world. Every Red Sox fan is an ambassador and a cheerleader for the greatest nation in baseball. We know the Red Sox Natives Meetup Group can help us find some passionate members who would like to participate in leading an on field Fenway cheer!" &lt;em&gt;TiTO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If chosen, members will be given free entry to the designated game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first six innings, you will be working with TiTO who will present you with your uniform (A Red Sox Cheerleader T-shirt and Wally pom-poms) and will teach you the daily cheer. Having a winning team smile is required! In the bottom of the seventh, the Cheerleaders for that game will be introduced, and you will walk out onto the field and follow through with your routine. (Remember to smile or you may not be invited back!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you cheer the fans on through the stretch, you will then watch the remainder of the game from the distinguished Red Sox Library Suite. Watch the the game or sip some Jack Daniels while reading any one of the many books about Red Sox history. (TiTO can recommend a good one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful opportunity for our members to help the Sox cheer on the start of an exciting new season! Both women and men encouraged to sign up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP now for this event, and you will be contacted directly by TiTO with additional instructions. (Including available dates and any additional requirements)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and make the Natives proud!&lt;/p&gt;
