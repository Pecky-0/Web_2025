I've never been there before, but hey, thats half the fun - exploring a new place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's one web site that outlines the place (including directions):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nemba.org/ridingzone/p_Lynn_Woods.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nemba.org/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Lynn Wood &lt;br /&gt;Get on I95 North. Take exit 44B for Lynn, Rt 129 East. This will dump you on a rotary, just continue to follow the signs for Rt 129 east. After you go about two more miles, a small road will go off to your right, which will be marked with a sign for the Larry Gannon Municipal Golf Course. Follow this road for about 200 yards until it dead ends into a parking lot with a baseball field on the side. This is the entrance to Lynn Woods. About 200 feet off the end of the parking lot will be the tail end of Walden Pond. To the left is the bulk of the reservation, including Dungeon Rock. To the right is the technical terrain that makes Lynn Woods awesome. Leave a lot of time and try both!&lt;br /&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I googled it too, and find the entrance here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Larry+Gannon+Municipal+Golf+Course,+lynn+ma&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=42.495359,-70.976958&amp;amp;spn=0.016264,0.025578&amp;amp;z=15&amp;amp;om=1" target="_blank"&gt;http://maps.google.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in the baseball field parking lot (mentioned above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;My cell is 603-475-8565 if you have questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary</member_name><member_id>4492222</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541853000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mountain Bikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>mountainbikes-102</urlname><id>485750</id><group_lat>42.1199989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>New England MTB Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185720050000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>August 26th, Sunday 9:30am, Lynn Woods MA</name><id>6093407</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1188135000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mountainbikes-102/events/6093407/</event_url></item>
