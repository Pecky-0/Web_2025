Most of the wine they produce is dry, but perhaps we can find an example of their late harvest styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, looking for volunteers to purchase wine (you will be reimbursed) and to bring appetizers to share.  The cost of the wines will be spread amongst those who attend.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noel</member_name><member_id>8463776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280501927000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>White Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1441608</id><group_lat>42.5900001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1278444991000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>July Meeting--Alsace</name><id>14019063</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280444400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/events/14019063/</event_url></item>
