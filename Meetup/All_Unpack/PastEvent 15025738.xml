The ambiance of the restaurant, the dining area in particular, was very pleasing, with tatami wall hangings giving diners a sense of privacy without cloying. The service was timely, friendly, and very helpful, and masterfully preserved the experience of an authentic Japanese dining experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food was beyond excellent; I personally sampled the Tako (Octopus) Sushi and Unagi (broiled eel over rice) entréé. The Tako was expertly flavored and quite tender, easily the best octopus sushi I've ever encountered. The Unagi was likewise superb, presented in an artful manner with a delightfully light flavor to match. The chefs at Noble are masters of their art, and deserve much praise for their work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend Nobles to anyone with an affection for authentic Japanese cuisine, or indeed, anyone who enjoys an above-average dining experience at reasonable prices. Seafood lovers in particular will not leave disappointed. Five stars out of five, I know I will be visiting again&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW...sounds great. Please join us for this fun and unique dining experience&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287959431000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun-Bunch</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH</urlname><id>648134</id><group_lat>41.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7600021362</group_lon><name>The West Hartford Over 40 Fun Bunch!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286398974000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>HIBACHI...Dining Japanese Style!!!</name><id>15025738</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287874800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/West-Hartford-FUN-BUNCH/events/15025738/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/b/2/global_18539042.jpeg</photo_url></item>
