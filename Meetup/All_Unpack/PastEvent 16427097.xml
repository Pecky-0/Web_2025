&lt;p&gt;This Tuesday (2/8/11) at Sonsie in Boston I will be hosting a networking event for the "Ex-Midwest Business Professionals in Boston" meetup group and I would like to extend an invite to everyone in this meetup group. It will be a joint event with "Successful Anonymous", a Boston based networking group for other business professionals. Light appetizers will be provided. This will be a nice opportunity to meet and network with other Midwesterners as well as people from Boston. Feel free to invite others, just please let us know ahead of time how many you will be bringing as the restaurant requests a final head count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonsie is in Boston on Newbury Street and is less than a block from the Hynes Convention Center Station on the T (Green Line). Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1297220101000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Opportunity to meet and network with other business professionals</why><group><who>Ex-Midwesterners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Midwesterners</urlname><id>545362</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ex-Midwesterners Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1296746115000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Networking at Sonsie on Newbury Street</name><id>16427097</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297206000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Midwesterners/events/16427097/</event_url></item>
