Make sure to think up a creative name for your name tag! At last month's event we had a &amp;quot;mob lawyer&amp;quot; a &amp;quot;government informant&amp;quot; an &amp;quot;envelope stuffer&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;jewel thief.&amp;quot; The tags will provide a fun ice breaker for everyone as well and generate a few chuckles along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This laid back but upscale mixer is perfect for making new business contacts and pitching your service or product. New in town? Looking to meet new people?
