THIS MEETING IS CANCELLED !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will finish up Bacon's The New Organon at our next meeting. There is Book 2, 150 pages left . This is more than usual , on the other hand we will have 3 weeks this time to read the material. (The New Organon Publisher: Cambridge University Press; New Ed edition December 12, 2002; ISBN: 0521564832).&lt;br /&gt;I also would like repeat here our plans that we decided upon after reading Nietzsche couple of months ago: Moore, Bacon, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz (maybe), Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel.... This is the big picture that we decided to follow, we work out the details at our meetings. One of these details from last meeting is that we are not sure reading Hobbes (at least not for now), and thinking of to continue with Descartes after the next meeting. Two works of Descartes came up so far: Discourse on the Method and Meditations on First Philosophy. These works are in the 1st and 2nd volume of The Philosophical Writings of Descartes (Translated by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff and Dugald Murdoch, ISBN:052128807 for Vol I and ISBN:052128808 for Vol II.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you at the next meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting test questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://iws.ohiolink.edu/~sg-kent2/31004/go_f91_macro-1.cgi" target="_blank"&gt;http://iws.ohiolink.e...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andras</member_name><member_id>2044995</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179710320000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-philosophy</urlname><id>119696</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Philosophy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174873524000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Francis Bacon: The New Organon II</name><id>5604861</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1176418800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-philosophy/events/5604861/</event_url></item>
