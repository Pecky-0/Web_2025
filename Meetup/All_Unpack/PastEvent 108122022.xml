<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all of you who came out to Dillon's for our February Friendly Takeover! It's awesome to have had several new faces and many repeat supporters. Keep spreading the word and encouraging your friends to sign up for our e-list by emailing visibleinboston@gmail.com!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our continued mission to increase the visibility of People of Color in Boston &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we have decided to finally start to put a dent into the Faneuil Hall area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I think we all know this as a very popular and convenient area that attracts lots of tourist, transplants and natives alike. In other words: It's &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;As always: Come out, have a drink and conversation and help us all be Visible in Boston.&lt;/strong&gt; Please continue to invite friends, colleagues, family and anyone else interested in making Boston a more socially representative city. We believe greatly in this movement and this community and hope you do as well. See you on the 29th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
