Hopefully, April's meeting will be just as good.  We're hitting the classics again, this time for real (for those of you who attended the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies meeting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been meaning to read our April book for years and just never got around to it and it sounds like a lot of people from tonight felt the same way. So, come join us on April 28th for Joseph Heller's Catch 22!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, we're going to try a new place and I'm actually pretty excited about April's choice of destination. We'll be meeting at Cafe MoMo in Manchester, a Nepalese restaurant. You can check out the menu here: &lt;a href="http://www.cafemomonh.com/menu.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.cafemomonh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usual cap of 12 people will apply so get your RSVPs in as quickly as you can. Also, please make sure to update your RSVP if it looks like you won't be able to make the meeting so that someone else can join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you on the 28th!!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>9</waitlist_count><updated>1272668956000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club</urlname><id>1332912</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>The Southern NH Books and Brew Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269483401000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Have you ever been in a Catch 22??</name><id>12985823</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272495600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Southern-NH-Books-and-Brew-Club/events/12985823/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/global_6582442.jpeg</photo_url></item>
