Sitaji is a new member and she is opening her home to anyone who enjoys Reiki and massage. I will give massage lessons to anyone who would like one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be joined by the Trailblazers meetup group!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reiki, which means. universal life- force energy, is a natural form of healing which originated in Japan over 2500 years ago. (In China, this energy is called Chi and the Hindus call it Prana) The Reiki System, a gentle &amp;quot;laying on&amp;quot; of hands technique based on ancient symbols, helps restore balance and harmony in our hearts and lives, supports the body's natural ability to heal itself, balances energy, loosens up blocked energy and promotes mental and spiritual well-being. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a Reiki session you lie fully clothed on a massage table while soft, soothing music plays in the background. The Reiki practitioner directs energy into specific parts of the body. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll begin the evening with a quick introduction. Then we will do a short silent meditation to quiet our minds and prepare us to do healings. Then we'll set up extra tables and work on each other. No prior experience needed, just an open mind and good intentions to share in this wonderful healing energy. Sitaji will give out Tarot card readings to anyone who would like one!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring a massage table if you have one. Wear comfortable clothing. If you have a soft cushion to sit on or a warm blanket please bring one. I will give a short demonstration and check to see if we have any natural healers in the group and tell you how to attune yourselves to the healing energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be having a potluck dinner, so please bring something in the &amp;quot;natural food' arena. We will meet at 6 to eat and then begin the massage / reiki at 7. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitaji Home is located at: &lt;br /&gt;176 Long Pond Road &lt;br /&gt;Northwood, NH. 03261 &lt;br /&gt;(Off Jenness Pond Road and 107)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter</member_name><member_id>486997</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224540646000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223292615000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Reiki / Massage Night </name><id>8905892</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224367200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/8905892/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/a/0/global_5769232.jpeg</photo_url></item>
