Drum Circles are a great way to stay connected to our inner rhythms. You'll learn some new rhythms, get some technique help and meet some great people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this meetup, you will need to bring a folding chair as we will be out at the Banks of The River Charles. If RAIN, we will meet inside at The DrumRoom 50 Tufts Steet, Arlington, MA Please call 781-316-8068 before heading out to drum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feedback from this Summer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Had a wonderful time.... The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. ‚Äù Irene&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will welcome you into the circle and help you feel comfortable.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alan</member_name><member_id>1328052</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221923003000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Drummers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>DrumConnection</urlname><id>886763</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1600036621</group_lon><name>The Boston Drum Circle</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220300722000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Drum Circle Meetup - Saturday, September 13th 3PM - 5PM</name><id>8664498</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1221332400000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/DrumConnection/events/8664498/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/e/5/global_2830581.jpeg</photo_url></item>
