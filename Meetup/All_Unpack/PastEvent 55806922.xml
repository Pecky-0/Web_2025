It is a moderate walk due to some downed trees that you will have to go over/around. The path is defined but you must follow the tree markers - you can easily go off the main path. My little one Maggie and I did it in about 2 hours or so. Directions are from the intersection of Silver Street and Federal Street/Bernardston Road in Greenfield. On the south side of Silver Street, the road is Federal Street. On the north side, the road is Bernardston Road. This is also routes 5 and 10 and goes to Bernardston. Take this road towards Bernardston until you see a True Value (Leader Home Center)&amp;nbsp;on your right, followed very soon by an Airgas Welding supply on your right. You will take the right at Airgas onto the road called Log plain Road. At the end of Log Plain Road, take a left onto Lampblack Road. Go approx 1 mile and on your left is the parking area for GTD Griswold Conservation Area. Dogs are supposed to be on a leash and you are asked to leave the area as you entered it. I will try and post the trail map and the directions as well as a picture I took (not so good) of one of the views on the trail of Notch Mt. I think because of the trail conditions, we should be a smaller group that stays together - you can easily miss a tree marker - just my experience. But don't take just my word - come and try it with me and see for yourself. The date is just a suggestion. Please make offers if there is a better time. Thanks.
