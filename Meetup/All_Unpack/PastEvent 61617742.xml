&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

On Sunday, April 29th I will host 3 different events in the North End...(**this is a slight change from the original plan**)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Anyone that is reading this information can attend all 3 of these events for a total of $40....the only thing that I ask, is that if you attend all 3 events, then you order at least a coffee/tea at Caffe Paradiso. This allows me to continue to utilize the function room for these events and keeps the manager happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

If you wish to attend only 2 of these events, the cost will still be $40, and you must attend at least the lunch at Saraceno. If this is the case, I ask that you notify me whether you want to attend either EVENT 1 + 2 (wine and dine) or EVENT 2 + 3 (dine and movie). If you attend EVENT 2 + 3, then you will receive a free coffee/tea and a biscotto at Caffè Paradiso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

The total number of persons I can host for these events are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Wine Tasting at the Wine Bottega - 25 persons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch at Saraceno - 35 persons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie at Caffe Paradiso - 25 persons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

As of this evening (April 21) there are approximately 10 spots open for the wine tasting and about 12 for the movie. I can take about 20 more people for the lunch at Saraceno. Priority goes to present Italian students in this program, followed by former students, followed by everyone else receiving this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not Italian-only speaking events. Even though some of the attendees are Italian and many of the students that attend are learning Italian, guests should not feel at a disadvantage if they are not at a comfortable Italian speaking level. The movie we will be watching is shown in Italian with English Subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events are a lot of fun, and there is always a lot of good conversation among interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

If you are driving in....parking is FREE and unlimited in the North End on Sundays until 6:00 pm...&lt;/p&gt;
