Previous attendees and newcomers all welcome! Come meet and talk with like-minded environmentalists, and get connected with leaders in the Sierra Club. Issues being addressed at this time include global warming, environmentalism in politics, better public transportation, and environmental justice. &lt;br /&gt;Opportunities abound...:) *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cash bar, limited free appetizers. We'll be hanging out in the area with the high top tables just to your right when you walk into the bar. And FYI, there will be people attending, because Sierra Club members received notice of the event a while back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mass Sierra</member_name><member_id>3278292</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1160778954000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Environmental Activists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Sierra-Club</urlname><id>229402</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Greater Boston Sierra Club Environmental Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1160234589000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sierra Club &amp; Beer!!</name><id>5181636</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1160605800000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Sierra-Club/events/5181636/</event_url></item>
