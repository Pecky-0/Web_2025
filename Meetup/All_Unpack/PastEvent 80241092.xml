 &lt;br /&gt;

 Here a little about the show; &lt;br /&gt;

 Photography is generally considered the capture of light, in fact the word photography literally translates to light painting. Photographers talk about light quality, color, quantity and so forth and spend their time trying to find the perfect lighting. &lt;br /&gt;

 For this series of images, I chose to focus on the lack of light, or shadows as a way to keep the emphasis on the subject. Shadows define form and create shapes while adding, in my opinion, visual interest. Through careful use of shadow, I can clearly define my subjects shape and form as well as direct the viewer’s eye around the image. I’m also able to hide or reveal different portions of the subject to create an image that the viewer might not see otherwise. &lt;br /&gt;

 I chose to use the human body as the medium for my Shadows for multiple reasons. By itself, it’s a visually interesting subject and by using tightly controlled shadows I can abstract the body and direct the viewer to see what I see. &lt;br /&gt;

 The combination of both the shadows and the body result in an image that I find much more interesting than either subject alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Lane</member_name><member_id>5229126</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1349145073000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346424953000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Opening Reception - Shadows, Photography by Dana Lane</name><id>80241092</id><duration>7200000</duration><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1348869600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/80241092/</event_url></item>
