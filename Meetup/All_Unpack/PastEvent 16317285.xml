The Kills' music is rooted in dirty, bluesy rock and a fair amount of vice, and while their music has become more melodic and beat-oriented as of late, they still bring an explosive, sexy chemistry to the stage, one that just feels like pure rock and roll.  And I think we can all agree that Alison Mossheart (also of The Dead Weather) is one hell of a bad-ass rock singer. I'm definitely going to be at this one. Tickets are $18 advance, $20 at the door, and doors are at 7.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael</member_name><member_id>3431633</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1304979386000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fans of Live Music Shows</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indierockboston</urlname><id>679091</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Indie Rock Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295730358000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Kills w/ Cold Cave, The Entrance Band @ Royale</name><id>16317285</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1303858800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indierockboston/events/16317285/</event_url></item>
