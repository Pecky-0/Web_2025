&lt;p&gt;The price is also right, shoes are $3.50 and games are $6 per game so I'm thinking we could roll a couple of games.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet at the Front Bowling Desk</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve rosen</member_name><member_id>3640517</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1301425493000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>I've talked to several Ex-Midwesterners and the thing I'm constantly hearing is "lets go bowling that would be fun".
