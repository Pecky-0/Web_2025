This class will be taught by Michelle P. Gentle yoga removes any fears or challenges in doing yoga, while it also assists with stress reduction, calming the mind, increasing self-acceptance and self-confidence. This gentler, slower paced practice makes yoga more accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels creating an atmosphere of safety and comfort. Meditation and breathing techniques will be practiced. Please remember: Wear comfortable clothing Bring water (we have water if you forget $1.00) Please don't eat before class. A health bar or yogurt should be fine for most people if you need to eat before doing yoga. The cost is $10 per class as a drop in rate. Package price of 6 classes for $48.00 is available. Cash or check only, please. All equipment that you need is there!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1330952222000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330456285000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gentle Hatha yoga Pocasset, MA $10 drop in, $48/6 class pass</name><id>54203762</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1330869600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/54203762/</event_url></item>
