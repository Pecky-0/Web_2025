This popular walking tour visits Cheney Hall, the silk mills, the South Manchester Railroad, the Loom exhibit at the former Cheney machine shop, neighborhoods of worker housing, and the Old Manchester Museum, where light refreshments are served. The walk takes up to two hours with a distance of a mile or so. Meet at 146 Hartford Road, Manchester, the former Cheney Office Building, and now occupied by Fuss &amp;amp; O'Neill. No rain date, so we will bring umbrellas if weather is iffy. Extreme weather cancels. Co-sponsored by the Manchester Historical Society, MCC's Institute of Local History, and the Cheney Brothers Landmark Historic District Commission.&lt;br /&gt;Photo c. 1900 of Cheney Hall, which we will pass on this walk. We will not be entering most of the buildings -- just the Loom Exhibit at the History Center, and the Old Manchester Museum.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Portable amplifier, flowered hat</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248169538000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242578787000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>History walk (more history than walk!) in Manchester, CT</name><id>10430935</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247936400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/10430935/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/global_8664013.jpeg</photo_url></item>
