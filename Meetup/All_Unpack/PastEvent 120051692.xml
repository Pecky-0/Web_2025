&lt;li&gt;The Charlestown Saturday Meetup has moved to Thurdsday night at 6:30. The gym is ours at 6:30 but you can sign up if you will be there by 7. We will warm up and play triples until 7 and then start 6 on 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up by emailing Mark. Requests received after the roster is posted will be placed on the waiting list and added if any players change their plans. &lt;span&gt;If you can't make it, please change your RSVP on the meetup site as early as possible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And let me know if you are running late.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Those who cancel last minute, don't show up, or consistently come late will not be admitted to future meetups. If you are not on the roster, please don't come expecting to play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is for Yankee C- and above level only. Players are required to know how to play 6-2 and 5-1 formations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is free if you are a member of Boston Community Centers. You can join at the Charlestown location for a $25 membership fee that is good for a year. Pick up an application when you arrive to play.  They will also honor membership from any other Boston Community Center if you prefer to join a different location. The list of facilities can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/BCYF/facilities/"&gt;http://www.cityofboston.gov/BCYF/facilities/&lt;/a&gt;. Rates and programs vary. It's not necessary to be a Boston resident.  The membership allows access to the Tuesday night meetup held at Orient Heights, East Boston, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some non-residential street parking by the gym and a parking lot directly benind the building, on Terminal St. Once you are on Medford St, take your first right and the lot is on your right side.  It is also 5 minute walk from the Sullivan T stop and Bunker Hill College stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
