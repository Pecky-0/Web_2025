We had so much fun at the Beerworks next to Fenway, that I decided... why not again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it's casual, drinkers can find whatever they want, and the food is pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll definitely be able to find me. I'll be the one wearing a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons T-Shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best T-Stop is going to be North Station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1153609396000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>D&amp;D Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-DnD</urlname><id>244439</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1150459525000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>July Boston Dungeons &amp; Dragons Meetup</name><id>4982366</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1153436400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-DnD/events/4982366/</event_url></item>
