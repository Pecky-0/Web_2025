Due to the need for good fresh snow, I'll call the headquarters Thursday to see if conditions are good or not and make the decision to go ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU NEED TO BRING THE RIGHT GEAR. &lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you have good wicking layers and a good waterproof outer layer, gloves, poles, waterproof boots, some food/snacks, water, and of course snow shoes.&lt;br /&gt;You can rent snowshoes at REI in Cranston if you do not have your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at the state offices parking lot in Providence at 8am to aim to be at the park by 10:30/11:00. When we meet we will do a gear check to make sure we have everything.&lt;br /&gt;When we check in at shop at the headquarters  on Poole Road they can provide detailed maps and recommendations of trails in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The web sites for the park and maps is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhparks.state.nh.us/state-parks/alphabetical-order/monadnock-state-park/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhparks.st...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;map:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nhstateparks.org/uploads/MonadnockHikingTrailsWeb.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nhstatepar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not planning trying for the summit, this is just an opportunity for us to practice and get comfortable before we get too adventurous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should not be necessary to do an overnight, it is 2 1/2 hrs there from Providence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO PETS are allowed in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entry fee is $4 per person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for the Blue Trailblazer and a guy with long hair.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ian Robinson</member_name><member_id>10403736</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264424628000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263752618000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mount Monadnock Snowshoeing</name><id>12343903</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264251600000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/12343903/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/c/global_5586652.jpeg</photo_url></item>
