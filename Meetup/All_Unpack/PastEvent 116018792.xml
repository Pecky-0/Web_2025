&lt;p&gt;Its that time again to help our friends with Appalachian Mountain Club , "AMC" . These are the folks who maintain the trails we all love to hike on . So its pay back time . We have almost 2,000 members in this club . I am looking for 40 of you that want to come out and get dirty and  help on a project you and your fellow hikers will enjoy for years to come . Myself and the other organizers never ask for anything in return for the hikes we post except knowing you enjoyed yourself or perhaps a simple thank you . So I am asking now for something in return  .We need your help .  . Its not easy work so please be prepared . It will be  hot , you will be sweating , you might even cry and ask why I came here .In the end you will know why . We are not moving mountains , well at least not this time .Kidding aside this a great project to be a part of .So please come on out and give us a hand .There will be other events like this later in the year were we ask again .Bring plenty of water and a lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please read the following description from Chris Shafer from the AMC .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
