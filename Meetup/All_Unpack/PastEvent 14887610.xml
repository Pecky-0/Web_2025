A Halloween bonfire afterward of course! &lt;i&gt;(I have broken this event up into 2 events for people who can only attend 1 of the 2, so please RSVP for the events individually!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: orangered"&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Pumpkin Valley Farm's website:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pumpkinvalleyfarm.com/Resources/pvftitle.gif" border="0" alt='' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Pumpkin Valley Farm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are Keith and Angela Harris and we want our family farm to be your source for Fall Fun! Located along the scenic Saco River in Dayton, Maine. We have been growing vegetables and pumpkins for 15 years. This will be our 9th annual cornfield maze and every year we strive to add more for your family to enjoy while you are here. So if you come visit us every fall, we thank you! If it has been a while, you will have to come see what it new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Fall, our farm comes alive with our 5 acre Cornfield Maze and the traditional harvest of pumpkins, cornstalks, gourds, ornamental corn and specialty pumpkins. Our farm is also about teaching how agriculture impacts your life with our &amp;quot;Planting Seeds of Knowledge&amp;quot; curriculum from The MAiZE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make conquering the new maze design a yearly family tradition! We guarantee it will make great family memories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: orangered"&gt;After the corn maze, there will be a Halloween Bonfire at my house, starting at 7pm (weather permitting!) Please see the other meetup for this date to RSVP for the bonfire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: orangered"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Address for the corn maze:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Union Falls Road&lt;br /&gt;Dayton, ME 04005&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: orangered"&gt;&lt;i&gt;* They always have plenty of signs, so as long as you get in the vicinity, it's very easy to find!
