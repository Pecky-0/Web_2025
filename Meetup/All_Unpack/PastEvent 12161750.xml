A topic, a presentation, a group sharing of images, something related to Photography!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then from 9 to 9:30 We will hang out again catching up with folks from that evenings topic. We'll clean up and head out by 9:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This months discussion topic: Photo Projects&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for two &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; volunteers to share their photo projects with us. Right now I have two folks who have offered to share. They will each get 10-15 mins to share their project. It can be with digital files on the projector, a book we can pass around, or prints, a portfolio of work... Tell us about your project in 10 mins or less. &lt;br /&gt;After everyone has shared we'll break out into groups and you can answer folks questions one on one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to share your story. Email me directly with &amp;quot;Photo Projects&amp;quot; in the Subject line. donna @ erbphoto.com Tell me about your project and how you'd like to share it. I'll get back to you with details. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Donna&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>4</waitlist_count><updated>1267317725000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>30</yes_rsvp_count><created>1262034369000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Worcester Photo Center Monthly Meetup</name><id>12161750</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267144200000</time><rsvp_limit>30</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/12161750/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/8/global_3031816.jpeg</photo_url></item>
