&lt;p&gt;This forum came about as a challenge from a group of Ron Paul supporters to a local Tea Party group. The Ron Paul "fanatics" have asked the Tea Party members to justify their support for the neoconservative interventionist statist candidates. The fanatics will make the ...argument that Paul is the godfather of the Tea Party and that the only true constitutional conservative in the GOP race. Expect an intense debate. This is the venue to express your views on what the Tea Party movement stands for. We would like as many Ron Paul supporters as we can to show up for this event to show that he does have Tea Party support; there are rumors that they are trying to outnumber us. Remember, it is important that we remain civil, courteous, and respectful.&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1323913064000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-1690</urlname><id>950430</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Massachusetts Ron Paul for President 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323440879000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pioneer Valley Tea Party's [Ron Paul] Liberty Forum</name><id>43922792</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1323907200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-1690/events/43922792/</event_url></item>
