This 1-hour walking tour explores the history and development of the Greenway from the Zakim Bridge through the Wharf District Parks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This walking tour begins in the Bulfinch Triangle and through the North End Parks designed to reunite the historic neighborhood with the city after the removal of the Central Artery overhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour continues through the historic Wharf District, once the hub of Boston's maritime economy with the bustling Long and Central Wharves on the Boston Harbor. Come and experience the present day urban planning that is knitting the city back together among Boston's architectural treasures along the waterfront.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet your guide near the entrance to the North Station T-stop, along Causeway Street, Boston. The tour leaves promptly at 5:30 so try to arrive 10 minutes beforehand. Tickets are $10 per person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour will end in the vicinity of Quincy Market where there are plenty of places to eat in addition to the restaurants along the harbor.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for people with blue Boston By Foot bags, pins, or a meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Charlotte Bulfinch</member_name><member_id>7618185</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220146961000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Bostonians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonbyfoot</urlname><id>1214263</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston By Foot Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218423006000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greenway Walking Tour</name><id>8518646</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219354200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonbyfoot/events/8518646/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/7/global_4722647.jpeg</photo_url></item>
