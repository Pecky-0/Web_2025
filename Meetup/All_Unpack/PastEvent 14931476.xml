Boy, this is a tough crowd! We scheduled several meetups and no one responded. Are we still jazzed, excited and thrilled to be gathering again? Let's see if we can make that old magic happen this time at a brand-spankin' new hotspot in Noho, called Eclipse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening to mixed reviews, we will have to see for ourselves. I have heard first hand from several unrelated folks that they really like the atmosphere and that the food was wonderful. but remember how much we enjoy hanging out together and laughing and getting to know new people? That, to me, is what 'breaking bread' is all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...after a long hot summer, we can venture forth and meet once again in a lovely local eatery and support someone who is cooking their heart out just for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to join us, please RSVP, if you can't make it, please let us know. It only takes a short minute to respon and it really makes us feel good to know that you are staying connected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;warmly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica &amp;amp; Christine&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1289520256000</updated><rating><average>4.57000017166</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>food lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Western-Mass-Eat-Up</urlname><id>1464899</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>Western Mass Eat-Up!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>23</yes_rsvp_count><created>1285718683000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Eclipse Restaurant in Northampton!
