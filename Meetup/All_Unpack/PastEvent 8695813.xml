We The People&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2008 SEMINARS / SEMINAR LEADERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 PM: The Historical Meaning of the Term &amp;quot;Sovereignty.&amp;quot; Did you know that the meaning of sovereignty is rooted in biblical law? How quickly America could be returned to her constitutional underpinnings if only more Pastors could understand this themselves and then lead their flock to abide by it. Attend this seminar to learn where America 's Founding Fathers learned the principle of true sovereignty. Led by New H ampshire 's Patriot Pastorâ€¦ Garrett Lear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 PM: A Review of the 2nd Amendment Heller Case This landmark  case marks the time  first  time,  in U.S. history,  the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to directly address whether the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right or a collective right applying only to state-regulated militias.  The Court held that an individual right to possess a firearm for private use is protected by the 2nd Amendment. Attend this seminar to understand the underlying importance of this decisio n. Led by constitutional attorney: Dr. Edwin Vieira.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:15 PM: The Search for a Constitutional Presidency. The Constitution clearly establishes the duties of the President. Did you know that the Constitution limits the extent to which the President can act independently? Did you know that under the Constitution Presidential authority is limited to only six areas? Do you wonder what that office would look like if the Constitution we re followed?  To find out, attend this workshop with Dr. Lee Button, Vice-Chair of the National Heritage Center for Constitutional Studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:15 PM: Partner Founding Documents: The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution for the United States . Even those who do pay lip service to the Constitution often do so without any understanding of the fundamental law that it rests upon.  That fundamental law is the Declaration of Independence. Attend this seminar led by Dr. Paul Jehle to explore the importance of this relationship to the sovereignty of the people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JON ROLAND &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offers the keynote speech featuring the so important yet &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; frighteningly overlooked 9TH AMENDMENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Presidential hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a lesson in constitutional government from founding fathers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dreepa</member_name><member_id>4145573</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1222467956000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1220632283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Constitution Day 2008</name><id>8695813</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1222012800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/8695813/</event_url></item>
