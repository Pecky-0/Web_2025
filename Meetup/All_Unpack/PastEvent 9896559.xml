The soul is aware of where we are internally not yet aligned with functioning to our fullest potential and does everything it can to reach that potential. When we have the opportunity to commit to something that will change our level of consciousness and our lives, the saboteur arises within us. He wants us to slip into unconsciousness, failing, and proving we are worthless. Unconsciousness may look like sleepiness, procrastination, or fear, to name a few. However, the saboteur can make you stronger, more convicted in your action and more ready and alert to act. It gives you the opportunity to stand for the change you want and make it solid in your whole being. Come and learn from Mother Clare Watts, Christian Master, how to turn around and make your relationship to this force in your life be one of strengthening and empowerment.&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Mother Clare&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother Clare is a mystic; ordained priest; Master Teacher of Christian mysticism; and co-director of a mystical Christian Order, a school with 15 Centers of Light in cities across the country.
