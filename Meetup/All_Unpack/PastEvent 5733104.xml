Kudeta is excited about us coming back for our first happy hour there in about a year. There will be drink specials and possibly some light food. And if you are hungry, you can always order sushi and appetizers (I remember their dumplings as being especially good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudeta?s website: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kudetanewhaven.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.kudetanewh...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Experience the flavors of Asian fusion cuisine in an atmosphere designed to captivate your senses.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRINK SPECIALS: &lt;br /&gt;$1.00 off well drinks and drafts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact info: Andrea 203-641-8083&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********Don't forget to support the clothing drive for Columbus House Shelter. ************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MelissaVT will be collecting the donations at HH on Monday. We've done well with drives in the past and here is another chance to give something back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clients of the Columbus House are in need of lighter clothes. They are looking for sweat pants, t-shirts, and new underwear (especially XL) and socks. Also, they are in need of large duffel bags and backpacks (bigger than the average gym duffel) to keep and transport the few possessions they have. If anyone is cleaning out their houses and run across these items or want to run to Target and buy some men's and women's underwear (especially the XL sizes), that would be awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1182222452000</updated><rating><average>3.6400001049</average><count>11</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>25</yes_rsvp_count><created>1178118166000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>5/07 Monday Happy Hour -- Kudeta</name><id>5733104</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178575200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5733104/</event_url></item>
