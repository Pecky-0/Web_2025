I have never done one before, but I figure it should be a fun and low impact way to enjoy the winter running season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have snowshoes, Dion Snowshoes will have loaner snowshoes available for those that would like to race but donâ€™t have snowshoes. If you need to borrow some, register ASAP to guarantee a pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The course will include both double and single track trails. Timing will be provided by 3C Race Productions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring trail sneakers. If there is not enough snow, the race will be a trail run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like it is usually a small field of runners, so lets plan to meet by the start. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, you are responsible for your fees...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tree</member_name><member_id>7444643</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263218988000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260051230000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Old Salem Greens Snowshoe Classic</name><id>12025631</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263045600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonruns/events/12025631/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/4/global_2413972.jpeg</photo_url></item>
