&lt;p&gt;If you miss the group before the movie, come find us after. We gather outside the room where the movie was just shown to discuss the film, allow for restroom breaks and to get a head count of all those who are interested in going out for munchies and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot Summary: The greatest love story ever told, starring... garden gnomes? In the upcoming "Gnomeo &amp;amp; Juliet," Shakespeare's revered tale gets a comical, off-thewall makeover. Directed by Kelly Asbury ("Shrek 2") and showcasing both classic and original songs by Elton John, the film features the voices of James McAvoy and Emily Blunt as Gnomeo and Juliet, who have as many obstacles to overcome as their quasi namesakes when they are caught up in a feud between neighbors. But with plastic pink flamingos and thrilling lawnmower races in the mix, can this young couple find lasting happiness?&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing a meetup pin and have a meetup sign.
