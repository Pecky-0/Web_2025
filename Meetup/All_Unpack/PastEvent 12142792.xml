So lets start the year out right!  Lets gather together for a fun/unique workshop type event that is geared to both individually &amp;amp; collectively establish clear intentions for 2010! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WILL NOT be your typical goal setting seminar...in fact I find that goals for me are counter productive....must be my rebellious side???? I find when I pressure myself in a 'goal sense' it always does the opposite.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I've decided to go a different route..I call it the ANTI-goal setting OR Theme based goals.  By incorporating the Synergistic Inspiration motto, Imagine~Create~Become we create simple daily tools that prepare us and propel that which we desire TO us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Imagine:&lt;/b&gt; We are going to create an overall, POWERFUL ANNUAL theme which will radiate through the other theme based areas of life (Relationships, Financial, Career, Fun/Hobbies, Health &amp;amp; Wellness) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create:&lt;/b&gt; We are going to create an easy 10-15 minute daily ritual that we will be committed too make this happen.  Remember...our desires manifest in the small, heroic daily steps we take...its in the smallest of change... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Become:&lt;/b&gt; We are also going to face any resistance/fears surrounding these themes by creating powerful affirmations that are tailored specifically to you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join me in this creative process....lets create a 2010 like you've never seen before!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dani &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please note** Workshop is $10 each.  Bring a friend, your favorite notebook, cash for the bar and food if hungry, and of course come open minded... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask the hostess where Cocktails &amp; Conversations </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Danielle Lucido</member_name><member_id>8800487</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263082153000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Personal Growth Seekers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cocktails-Conversations</urlname><id>1372859</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0100021362</group_lon><name>Cocktails &amp; Conversations</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1261677826000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cocktails &amp; Convo's 2010 Annual Master-Mind </name><id>12142792</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262908800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cocktails-Conversations/events/12142792/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/1/5/global_12377397.jpeg</photo_url></item>
