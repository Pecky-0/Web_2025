I downloaded a trail map and it looks like it could be fun. So I'm going to take Jack and Bella down there on Saturday Morning and check it out. We would love to have company, we plan on hiking for about 2 or so hours. I have to say I have never been there before and do not know what to expect. So you may want to bring lots of water and something to snack on. I thought we'd do the Beaver Brook trail towards Great Meadow pond. There looks to be parking at the trail head on the left side of route 130, about 2 miles after route 122. Those who RSVP yes I will send a number with a way to reach me. You can download this map also by going on the message board and picking up Jeff's link. Thanks for the suggestion Jeff.&lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif' border='0' alt='smile' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be in the tan Chevy Tracker with the "WOOF" sticker on back</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jennifer</member_name><member_id>4251176</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1219499041000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SDS - Super Doggie Soles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Manchester-Doggie-Paws</urlname><id>1101339</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Human Soles &amp; Doggie Paws Hikers &amp; Walkers of Manchester, NH</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217372826000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Beaver Brook Hollis, NH</name><id>8437594</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1217685600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Manchester-Doggie-Paws/events/8437594/</event_url></item>
