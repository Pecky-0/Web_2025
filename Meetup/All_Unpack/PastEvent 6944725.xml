Here's a great opportunity to change that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really want to meet all the folks whose names and pictures we see on our Meetup, but whom we have yet to meet in person. And we'd like to introduce our existing members who have yet to embrace Meetup to people that already use Meetup and can tell them about it from personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great opportunity to mix and mingle and relax at the end of the weekend. So come along and have a fun and friendly Sunday evening with everyone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please BYOB; your hostess will provide some light munchies - so you need to RSVP so that she knows how much to cater. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** PRIZES &amp;amp; SURPRISES AT THIS EVENT! ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who attends this event stands a chance of winning one or more of the following prizes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 X Two-for-the-price of one discount voucher for the Anniversary Dance on January 19, 2008; &lt;br /&gt;2 X $10 off discount coupons for the Anniversary Dance on January 19, 2008; &lt;br /&gt;2 X $10 off BBTC Membership Dues (for non-members/prospects who sign up at this event).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Since this event is being held at a private home, only those folks who RSVP YES or MAYBE to this event will be e-mailed with the exact address and directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If less than 5 YES RSVP's are received by the cut-off of Saturday Jan. 12th, the hostess reserves the right to cancel the event &amp;amp; go drinking @ the Alchemist Lounge instead!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>The foreign-sounding blonde who opens the door is your hostess.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1200440469000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><why>Great friendly company and all sorts of prizes await those who attend this event!</why><group><who>Beanstalks and their Friends</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>tall-15</urlname><id>410040</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Beanstalks Tall Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1198167667000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Meetup Magic Party</name><id>6944725</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1200267000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/tall-15/events/6944725/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/a/a/global_1784474.jpeg</photo_url></item>
