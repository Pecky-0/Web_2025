<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Max has graciously invited us back to &lt;b&gt;celebrate the solstice&lt;/b&gt; at his family's home - Winslow Farm - in West Falmouth.  As many of you know this is an extremely beautiful spot very close to Portland.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an informal, social-only event with no specific agenda other than sharing a potluck meal to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are directions from Max:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Portland follow Rt 100 North (Washington Ave) until it turns into Gray rd in Falmouth.  We live 2 miles north of Hannaford on the right.  The farm is called Winslow Farm, there is a farm stand building, and a greenhouse with a flower business there.  We live in the large barn in the back.  The address is 291 Gray Rd.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't forget to bring your potluck kit (dish/bowl/utensils/cup/napkin)!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246023226000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244815030000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Solstice Potluck &amp; Bonfire at Winslow Farm</name><id>10636938</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245537000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/10636938/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/9/global_9106249.jpeg</photo_url></item>
