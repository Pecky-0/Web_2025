Have you been to Sanford (SFM) Lately? They have a great breakfast at the Cockpit Cafe located on the field. Feel like taking the Portland Light House tour after our delicious breakfast? Then check this out.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this once a couple of years ago with my dad. It was a lot of fun and very scenic, one you won't forget. I made a stop at Biddeford (B19) and the owner of the FBO highly suggested that I do this.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I remember correctly there are about five or six light houses along the coast within a few miles of each other. From here we contact Portland Apc. and request flight following with the light house tour. These guys do a great job and I found it very easy to do. Portland actually vectors you at a set altitude towards and around all the light houses, they even spin you around if you want to view them all over again in the other direction.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don't forget to ask your loved one or a friend to join you. Your not going to want to miss this one and don't forget that camera...HOW ABOUT THAT.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/KSFM" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.airnav.com...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gary Archer</member_name><member_id>6716312</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1244066443000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242360485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sanford ME, for Breakfast  &amp; The Portland Light House tour.</name><id>10416826</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1243771200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/10416826/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/4/6/global_8632678.jpeg</photo_url></item>
