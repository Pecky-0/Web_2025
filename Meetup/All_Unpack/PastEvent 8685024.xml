Project Smile donates stuffed animals, coloring books/crayons and small toys for police officers, fire fighters and paramedics to give to children. Many of the children receiving these items were involved in car accidents, witnessed domestic violence, victims of child abuse or sick/injured. Project Smile also donates stuffed animals for children entering foster care in Massachusetts and works with elderly residents of nursing homes. Since 2003, Project smile has donated over 22,000 stuffed animals and works with 141 police and fire departments. The organization was founded by your Meet Up organizer Catherine- you can bid on her too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tickets are only $13 and includes a raffle entry&lt;/b&gt;. Tickets can be purchased at www.projectsmile.org/events.htm Tickets can also be purchased at the door. If you have trouble finding us, please call 774 232 0000.
