Suggestions so far include the economic aspect of Peak Oil, and the connection of Peak Oil to the Iraq war. Since we've been meeting for a number of months now, maybe it's time to start talking about goals for the short and medium-term. (Maybe too soon for long-term?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will start the discussion at 6:30 in the O'Natural's meeting room, and go until 8:30 (or they throw us out). Anyone who wishes to eat there first, let's meet at 6 in the dining area.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John Brooking</member_name><member_id>2040136</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1139787100000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Advocates for Oil Awareness</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>oilawareness-169</urlname><id>113465</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1138324056000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Portland Maine Oil Awareness February Meetup</name><id>4842144</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1139614200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/oilawareness-169/events/4842144/</event_url></item>
