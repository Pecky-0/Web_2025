Father Peter is an incredible Teacher, an inspiring musician, the author of several books on the Christian Mystical path, and the co-director of the Order of Christ-Sophia.  Father Peter is one of the few Teachers I have met who speaks from a deep well of personal experience and speaks right to my soul.  Please, come and join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace be with you,&lt;br /&gt;Shakur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regeneration in the Light of Christ&lt;br /&gt;There are many saints found to be preserved throughout time with their flesh fully intact. The Light within them was so pure that it regenerated all of their cells, which made them transcend the natural course of decomposition. Light is a natural preservative, cleaning all toxins and wastes out of the body, bringing the body into its natural state of balance and health. The light of the Sun is the source of all life here on Earth, just as the Light inside of you is the source of all life in your body. The origin of this Light is something we call the Christ or Cosmic Consciousness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us, in this seminar, for a discussion and experience of the reality of the Light.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542629000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195352356000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar: Regeneration in the Light of Christ</name><id>6761725</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196553600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/6761725/</event_url></item>
