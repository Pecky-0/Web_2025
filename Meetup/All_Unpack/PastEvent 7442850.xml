I hope you love the food here as much as I.  Since the place is very small, I'm limiting it to 8 people.  They only have one table big enough for that many, so hopefully (they don't take reservations), we can get it.  If not, then we should be able to get two tables of four.  See you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information below was added by Tonya&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;The following MEMBER GUIDELINES were developed so our events run smoothly.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our focus is on friendly and respectful gatherings while sharing a delicious meal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow diners time by arriving promptly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring enough cash to pay for your meal, drinks, tip, and tax. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP YES only if you are certain you will attend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your name appears on the event page as a YES after the event &lt;br /&gt;and you have not attended the event, it is counted as a NO-SHOW. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you change your RSVP from a YES to a NO in less than twenty-four hours&lt;br /&gt;of the the event, without an explanation, it is counted as a NO-SHOW. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any guests you've RSVPd for NO-SHOW it will count as if you've NO-SHOWED. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a NO-SHOW for three events you are removed from the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO-SHOWS impact everyone; from you, who could or has been on the wait list,&lt;br /&gt;to the organizer as well as the restaurant's who staff based on our reservation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is less than twenty-fours from the event and you are not able to attend&lt;br /&gt;or are running late, you must contact the organizer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An email from you to Tonya explaining your absence or&lt;br /&gt;less than twenty-four hour RSVP change from YES to NO, is an expected courtesy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're not sure you can attend because you have other unconfirmed plans or&lt;br /&gt;uncertain transportation, please RSVP NO with a comment requesting to be placed on wait list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this event is full and you wish to attend, please RSVP NO with a comment to be placed on wait list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your feedback is appreciated, so please rate the event and venue by completing the surveys after the events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An organizer will arrive at least fifteen minutes before the event to confirm seating as well as welcome you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>It's a very small place.
