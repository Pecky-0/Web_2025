Please know that my intent is to enjoy the view of the area, and to chat along the way.  This event is meant more to have fun than to get a workout.   I thought that we would enjoy nature for about two or three hours, with a few breaks/stops along the trail.  This park is just full of beautiful views, so come and enjoy some fresh air, beautiful views, and all this while in good company of friends.&lt;br /&gt;We will meet at 1:00 pm in the lot at the park entrance for Benson’s Animal Park in Hudson NH.   &lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS:  Take Route 111 towards Salem, take a right on Kimball Rd, travel about ¼ mile to the park entrance on your right.  Look for the meetup sign.&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to bring plenty of fluids and to dress in layers so that you will be comfortable the whole time we are out on the trails.  &lt;br /&gt;If anyone cares to, we can then go grab a bite to eat or enjoy a hot chocolate, at a nearby restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;This event is at no cost.   I hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP or call my cell @ 603-247-0897&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location:  Benson’s Animal Park, Kimball Hill Rd, Hudson, NH&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will have a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1294609036000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Night Life &amp; Outdoor enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>PortsmouthAndBeyond</urlname><id>496430</id><group_lat>43.0699996948</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7799987793</group_lon><name>The Portsmouth "and beyond" Nite Out Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1292778046000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hiking, Snowshoeing or Cross Country Skiing at Benson's Animal Park, Hudson, NH</name><id>15772440</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1294596000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/PortsmouthAndBeyond/events/15772440/</event_url></item>
