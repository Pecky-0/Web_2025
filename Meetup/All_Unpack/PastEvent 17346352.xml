<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This will probably end up being a repeated daytime event if we have good response from those who are free to walk during a weekday. You're welcome to bring dogs (I run mine offleash in this area), but you're welcome without them, as well :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll probably do a loop of about an hour. Most of the footing is dry dirt road or old pavement, although there are plenty of ponds, puddles and inlets for dogs to splash around in.&lt;/p&gt;
