&lt;p&gt;Don't worry if you don't rock the cue stick. Lots of people aren't that great at pool, but some SoJusters have claimed to have the skills. So show up for lessons, laughs, or just good people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 We'll have a few tables reserved from 6-8PM for the pool sharks, but plenty of non-billiards hanging out as well. Jillian's has some great appetizers, sandwiches and a full bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So look no further if you want to cross-promote your events and campaigns while avoiding hitting the 8 ball, are seeking like-minded progressives to play pool with in Boston, or are new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in. If you want to build a strong cross-issue social justice movement, SoJust is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fee:&lt;/strong&gt; $10 ($2 suggested SoJust donation + $8 for billiards)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* 18+, must be 21 to drink (bring ID). Venue is physically accessible. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEY ORGANIZERS!&lt;/strong&gt; If you're involved with a group or project and want to spread the word bring flyers - there will be lots of opportunity to schmooze and network!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions:&lt;/strong&gt; Take the Green line to Kenmore Square, bear left onto Brookline Avenue, take the second left onto Lansdowne Street, at the end of the street make a left onto Ipswich Street - you will see the entrance on the left hand side. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socializing for Justice&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.sojust.org"&gt;www.sojust.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 Since 2006, we've been building this great sandbox where we can bring progressives of all stripes together and try out new ideas in this "Movement Moment". Spaces like this are crucial as we start to reframe and build new visions for our movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With almost 2200 members and almost 6 years of creating a diverse cross-issue community in Boston (135+ events!), Socializing for Justice is the best place to find the great people, organizations and community you're looking for while putting the SOCIAL back in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES, WE MEAN YOU&lt;/strong&gt;. We've got members of all ages, races, genders, sexual orientations, levels of activism and professions. We hope you see someone like yourself and meet someone you otherwise wouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;
