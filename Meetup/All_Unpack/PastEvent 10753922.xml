I'm delighted to help re-launch the Ex-Midwesterners Meetup group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awhile back I saw there was a need for an organizer and I figured .... what the heck! But .... I'll need your help! Many thanks to Steve Rosen who has already stepped up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rattlesnake is fun place and Steve has an area set aside for us. If it's nice, we can wander out to the deck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're willing to help, here are a few things ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring name tags - my thought is to include your first name and where in the Midwest you're from or went to school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help with check-in - I don't want it to be too formal, but I do want people to feel welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scout out for events, locations, etc. that would be suitable for a gathering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you'll see from the revised description, my motto is: Conversations first, business cards later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's just relax, have a fun gathering and get to know some other displaced NICE people! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing you on the 23rd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any ideas of events, locations, etc. would you please contact Steve Rosen&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the Ex-Midwesterners location</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Darling</member_name><member_id>179610</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve rosen</member_name><member_id>3640517</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>27</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249686857000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Midwesterners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Midwesterners</urlname><id>545362</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Ex-Midwesterners Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>39</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246216423000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Re-launch of Boston Ex-Midwesterners - please join us!</name><id>10753922</id><headcount>35</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248390000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Midwesterners/events/10753922/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/global_4872018.jpeg</photo_url></item>
