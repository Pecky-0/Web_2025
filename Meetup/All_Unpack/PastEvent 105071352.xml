&lt;p&gt;Viviane's friend Tom cannot make it for the 2nd, as hoped.  he and his wife have a nice time planned that night.  Instead he can come on the 16th!!!  He has a machine and will set it up in my house. He is quiet excited.   i imagine the same number can come as for movies.. with overflow in the kitchen and on the stairs,, who knows.  we will see.  Just figured the flash mob group can have fun in pairs...  we will start with food and conversation... should get going by 730-8 when all have arrived... who knows.  who cares???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as always, i will get pizzas, depending on how many... byob...come have fun!!!&lt;/p&gt;
