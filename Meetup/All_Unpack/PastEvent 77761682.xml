&lt;p&gt;For those who love oysters or Martin's or Drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Naked Oyster has a Happy Hour daily from 4PM-7PM with $1 Oysters and $6 Martini's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could do this on a Saturday? I called and checked they Happy a Happy Hour on Saturdays as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They serve than just more oyster. Would love to get a group together to go eat there. They have a Vodka bar with over 100 Vodkas too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have Soups/ Salads/ Chicken Dishes / Steak/ Burgers etc. It's more of a French Louisiana Cuisine but I would love to try their Oysters and Oyster Shooters. Can't go wrong with Dollar Oysters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of Parking in the Area and Street Parking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for Tina, as described in the event post.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Tina</member_name><member_id>38373502</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1346092866000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1344985052000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner/Happy Hour at The Naked Oyster ($1 Oysters)</name><id>77761682</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1345930200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/77761682/</event_url></item>
