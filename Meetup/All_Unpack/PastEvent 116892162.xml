&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth hike in the Five-Park Hiking Challenge. &lt;br /&gt;

Join Amy Wilmot, a DCR interpreter and myself on a moderate 5 mile hike in Wompatuck State Park. This park, over 3,526  acres in size, is heavily wooded and offers a wide diversity in habitat. It is the site of the former Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot Annex which was in use from 1941 until 1965. It contains over 100 decommissioned military bunkers, most of which are filled in, but are still partly exposed. It is also a very popular biking spot and offers over 400 campsites.  It is located mostly in the town of Hingham.  &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;

This hike will be mostly flat, with very little elevation gain. We will explore the northern portion of the park, passing by Wildcat and Heron Ponds and stopping for lunch at a scenic cove of the Aaron River Resevoir. The park is full of interesting and unusual glacial rock formations including Burbank Boulder which will be along our route. There are many different types of woodlands, including numerous groves of holly, hemlock, beech and white pine. Wompatuck is also a very popular bird watching area. We will share some interesting information and discuss unique features that this park has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
