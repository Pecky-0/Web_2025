When you arrive security will direct you to the correct floor. There is also parking available at a cheap evening rate in the building. Parking is also free on the street in front of the building at 6 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 6:30 PM our fellow member Jim Wilson will talk about hexlib, a JavaScript UI library he's been developing for making tile-based web games, particularly for use with Google Wave and other Comet frameworks.  You can learn more on this project at &lt;a href="http://github.com/jimbojw/hexlib" target="_blank"&gt;http://github.com/jim...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the presentation | demonstration, we will go around the room introducing ourselves and asking the group for advice | opinions on any JavaScript-related issues members are facing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft will provide pizza again. What a generous organization! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP and bring guests.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Marsh Sutherland</member_name><member_id>3795141</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272498310000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>JavaScripters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>javascript-2</urlname><id>884541</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0400009155</group_lon><name>The Boston JavaScript Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264545030000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Hexlib: A JavaScript library for creating web games by Jim Wilson</name><id>12432104</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268348400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/javascript-2/events/12432104/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/4/f/global_2825455.jpeg</photo_url></item>
