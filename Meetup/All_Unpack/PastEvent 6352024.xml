The Skellig was a big success this month and everyone was happy with the new venue, so we're keeping it there.The appetizers are more traditional than Margaritas, the menu is a typical pub-style, and the drinks cost less. It's a very relaxed atmosphere with large tables for our group.  It's also closer to the parking lot, just around the corner. So, The Skellig it is! I hope you'll all join us there!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;debbie&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael B</member_name><member_id>2958968</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>8</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192316561000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>divorcesupport-249</urlname><id>368805</id><group_lat>42.1899986267</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Boston/Burbs Life after Divorce Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189699885000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Skellig Monthly Meetup</name><id>6352024</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192143600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/divorcesupport-249/events/6352024/</event_url></item>
