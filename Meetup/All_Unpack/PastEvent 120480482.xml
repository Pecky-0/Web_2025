&lt;p&gt;What happens when we look simply and clearly at our experience as it really is? What happens when things that have been weighing us down for years no longer affect us? What emerges when we see ourselves and the world as they truly are - unclouded by unnecessary judgments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A radical new understanding may emerge. This understanding permeates all aspects of our lives, bringing lasting happiness. This is not the pleasant feeling and state of mind we typically associate with the word happiness, but an ever-present, limitless happiness which is available at all times, under all conditions, in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin with a guided meditation to bring about deep relaxation and rest. Then we will explore our experience at the levels of the mind and the body. &lt;br /&gt;

 What does “oneness” feel like? What does it mean for our everyday lives? How do we function in light of this new understanding? What happens to anxiety or depression? How does it affect our health, our relationships, our careers? What you discover may surprise (and delight) you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be guided meditation, silence, relaxation, and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
