<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>What motivates us to do anything?  If it is simply survival then the only thing distinguishing us from non-human animals is the level of our intelligence.  But even if it is only intelligence that truly distinguishes our humanity, does not that alone implicate a whole range of other concerns, for does not morality and love and artistic enjoyment and the joy of &amp;quot;freedom&amp;quot; first depend upon intelligence and rationality?  But, nonetheless, perhaps all these things are merely a sublimation of pleasure or, as Freud believed, sexual pleasure in particular.  Then again, perhaps Freudianism, hedonism and other pleasure based motivational viewpoints are profoundly wrong and that enlightenment and the expansion of consciousness trump all others.  Or, are all of these motivational groundings (and others) true?  No doubt these questions will be finally resolved at the end of our discussion!
