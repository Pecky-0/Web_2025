I've been sick, so that doesn't help. I still haven't seen Avatar and I've been told that I should. Let's try for one of the 3D shows. Can anyone else make it on Saturday night (February 6)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts at 7:45 PM at Showcase on Saturday night. Let's meet in the Worcester Showcase lobby at 7:15. Remember, we're going to see Avatar in 3-D. Not the regular old 2-D show. Showcase lets you purchase tickets online, so feel free to do that if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're going to be late, or you need to contact me for any other reason, my cell phone number is 508-981-0455.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- David&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll wear my superman cap</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Bainbridge</member_name><member_id>2199348</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265675015000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Movie Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-579</urlname><id>797632</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8099975586</group_lon><name>The Worcester Movie Fans Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1264980985000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Avatar in 3D</name><id>12477429</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265501700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-579/events/12477429/</event_url></item>
