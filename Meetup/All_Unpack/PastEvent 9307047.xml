It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human â€” and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll plan to meet at Clear Conscious Cafe, but if the crowds eek us out, head kitty corner across the street to Au Bon Pain, 1100 Mass Ave (cross Prospect St and Mass Ave and look for the yellow awning on Mass Ave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick one, so we've got a little more time to get it in:-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234225982000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228822576000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace</name><id>9307047</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231804800000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/9307047/</event_url></item>
