Come tap into your imagination &amp;amp; intuition &amp;amp; learn about yourself through the process called SoulCollage®.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering what SoulCollage® is? Are you an artist looking for some inspiration &amp;amp; a new medium? Are you looking to meet wonderful like minded souls? Have you been meaning to put a card together but haven't found the time? Are you always on the lookout for new images? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you will love this meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No experience necessary. This is open to all levels, whether you have 200 cards or none - you are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a door prize.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've recently acquired magazines from the 1970s &amp;amp; 1980s, the images in there are a blast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Led by an experienced SoulCollage® Facilitator.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one that says "Good Morning" in the middle of the evening :)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kimee</member_name><member_id>112839</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252764932000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Intuitive artists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>collage-106</urlname><id>1231011</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Above and Beyond Boston SoulCollage Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228706494000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Soul Collage Monthly Meetup </name><id>9299551</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1236810600000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/collage-106/events/9299551/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/8/global_6549704.jpeg</photo_url></item>
