<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>The Women &amp;amp; Family Life Center in Guilford, a non-profit organization &amp;quot;that serves women &amp;amp; their families during times of transition though education, support, wellness and referral&amp;quot;, needs some help. They would like to reclaim and revitalize their community garden, but are having a hard time keeping up with the weeds and saplings. That's where we come in. This project, the &amp;quot;Arbor Bushwhacking Coalition&amp;quot;, is being sponsored by the United Way of Greater New Haven through their &amp;quot;Days of Caring&amp;quot; initiative (for more information on the initiative and other great volunteer&lt;br /&gt;opportunities, &lt;a href="http://www.uwgnh.org/LiveUnited/Volunteer/day_caring/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So equip yourself for vegetative combat and be prepared to do battle with weeds, small trees, prickly bushes and their allies. I recommend, at the minimum, a pair of gauntlets (sturdy work gloves), a visored helm (comfy hat to block the sun), a pair of boots, and a weapon of your choice (clippers, shovel, saw, mattock, etc.). No tools will be provided to us, so if you have extras, please bring them. If you're flush with equipment and either  can't go or can't be there early, please &lt;a href="http://newintown.meetup.com/531/message/?recipientId=2422633"&gt;contact me (Ben)&lt;/a&gt; and I'll arrange to pick up the tools from you and see what I can do about getting you a t-shirt as thanks for your capital support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your RSVP, please indicate whether or not you have tools to bring, and if so, which ones. If you don't have any, don't worry, hopefully there'll be extras, else we'll find some other use for you (maybe you can hold branches over us to provide shade, or possibly fan us with palm fronds). Also, please indicate in your RSVP your t-shirt size, as the United Way is kindly providing us with t-shirts (read: uniforms). &lt;i&gt;If you think you will come, please RSVP early (preferably by 9/15), so that we can make sure you get a t-shirt!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take note that there will be waiver or two that you'll need to sign upon arrival -- essentially a liability release in the event that someone, for example, deftly and mightily swings a mattock at a weed and end up hitting your foot, and a media release that says the UW can take a picture of it and put it up on their website. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fun starts at 9am and lasts until 5pm, but feel free to come for as much or as little of it as you like -- every little bit helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post-slavery libations at a yet-to-be-determined establishment. Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions? Concerns?
