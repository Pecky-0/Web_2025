The newest restaurant in a small chain that has several popular locations on the Cape, THIS location is decidedly more upscale and elegant befitting the Providence nightlife. Oddly,  I have actually been in the one in Yarmouth - so you can only imagine my suprise at realizing the connection to the one in Providence - they've done a great job! The restaurant is also located next to the tunnel that connects to the skating rink so its a great place for an apr√®s-skate drink or bite to eat. It's a versatile place that becomes a nightclub after the weekend dinner crowd leaves and I've heard the food is great to boot! It's one to know about, so let's check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. &lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ken is hosting this one - please look at his picture!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
