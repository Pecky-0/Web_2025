Amelie is my favorite movie - it is artfully filmed, the soundtrack is beautiful, the storyline is sweet and its concept original.  Since some people had expressed interest in watching the film anyhow, I figured - hey, why not make a meetup out of it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you already love the film or you've never seen it before, you're welcome to come watch at my apt- hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>must sign up for the meetup to find out!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dorise</member_name><member_id>8988783</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1247447511000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246161153000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Amelie!</name><id>10750995</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247274000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/10750995/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/4/global_9374532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
