Singles Night Life group ,are going Ice Skating at the same time and place as we are. After ice skating, their making RSVP"s for the Dueling Piano Bar in Prov. R.I. Sounds like fun to me!&amp;nbsp;Last day I will make reservations is up to tommorow and then you can do your own thing!&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp; I have already made reservations for 22, and will keep updating the numbers if more people and their posse's want to go. This sounds like a great way to meet a bunch of people and have a fun night out! As always, please send me any comments ,suggestions, or questions, hope to see ya'll soon! Rich a attendum: The Boston -Prov. Singles had to cancel due to another meetup, but the Providence Collective meetup will join us instead very cool!&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After Ice Skating at Kennedy Plaza</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332030560000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>awesome people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group</urlname><id>1300868</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Providence Biking and Recreational Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1326988341000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Point St. Dueling Piano Bar</name><id>48755922</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328401800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Providence-Biking-and-Recreational-Group/events/48755922/</event_url></item>
