&lt;p&gt;The building will be open from 1-5pm for visitors. There will be many studios to move throughout as you get acquainted with who's who in the building! &lt;br /&gt;

 Joy Street Studios is a continually growing community for the Arts, it houses a cornucopia of options to see inquire about and if the work moves you, purchase!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MY STUDIO is #51, it will serve as an un official home base for all attendees to come by and at minimum meet me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A FREE EVENT!! Entrance and your participation cost you nothing, it's only a purchase price to go home with some art:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy St studios is located behind union square, as Somerville ave comes down and hits the McGrath highway, RT.28, Joy street is behind the "Autozone" business, then a short 2 minute drive down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking at the building is free! If you are unfamiliar with the area, then I would say you should use your smart phone for directions from your place...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;86 Joy St, somerville MA, 02143&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public transportation has a few options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the T to either Sullivan station or Lechmere Station. It is about a 10-15 minute walk from either station. I would say that Sullivan is easier as it's a straight walk up Cambridge St that Becomes Washington St, walking towards union square, then a left turn at Joy St. It's about 2 minutes down on your left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lechmere Station is fine as well. That's a pretty straight walk along the Mcgrath Highway, yes there are sidewalks... walk away from Boston, walking on the right side of the highway is easier I think. You will get to Poplar St, it's a right hand turn, take it. Walk straight ahead thru 2 stop signs and Joy Street Studios will be on your left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Yellow door with a large 86 above it is the landmark... Plus we will have a few balloons to make the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to take the bus, but I believe its the 80, 86 and 90 that stops at Poplar street and then its a short 2 minute walk down Poplar to the door. Buses can be got from Lechmere station or anywhere along those routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are also welcome to invite friends to attend!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason</member_name><member_id>12089530</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334427832000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Art Models and Artists</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>NE-artists-models-group</urlname><id>408475</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>New England Artists/Models Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333284099000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Visit Art Studios at Joy St Studios in Somah-ville!!!</name><id>58746842</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334422800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NE-artists-models-group/events/58746842/</event_url></item>
