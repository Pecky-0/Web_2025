 &lt;strong&gt;Talk and slide show by Marsha Zellner preceded by potluck dinner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what is real vs imagined of the stories of flesh-eating spiders or wolves and bears with a preference for human flesh? Marsha Zellner, M.D., will give an in-depth look (with illustrations) at the venomous snakes and insects in the continental US, and will discuss a variety of animal bites and the diseases associated with them. She will discuss identification, geographic location, those at risk, prevention, and urgent medical care for those unfortunate enough to be bitten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsha is a full-time emergency medicine physician at St. Vincent’s &lt;br /&gt;

 Hospital in Bridgeport, and is board certified in internal &lt;br /&gt;

 medicine. She is also a certified Wilderness First Aid Provider. &lt;br /&gt;

 Marsha has extensive experience as a hike leader and educator for &lt;br /&gt;

 Mosaic Outdoor Clubs of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is Saturday August 11, 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., at &lt;br /&gt;

 USNH, 700 Hartford Turnpike, Hamden. We will start with a &lt;br /&gt;

 potluck dinner from 4:00 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. Marsha’s presentation &lt;br /&gt;

 will follow with plenty of time for questions and answers. &lt;br /&gt;

 Please bring a dish to share!&lt;/p&gt;
