<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We've decided to have a game night and party each month during the winter (and this is the second of 3). This helps break up the long nights and to socialize with lots of fun! This event will be held at Janice's condo complex clubhouse (a.k.a. the hall) in South Windsor. We'll have an large fireplace with fire, music, bathrooms, and full kitchen available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ganes we have already: &lt;br /&gt;* Pictionary &lt;br /&gt;* Picture Picture &lt;br /&gt;* Worst Case Scenario &lt;br /&gt;* Trivial Pursuit &lt;br /&gt;* Scrabble&lt;br /&gt;* Fact or Crap &lt;br /&gt;* Jenga (well a knockoff version) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd like to see someone bring these as well as anything else: &lt;br /&gt;* Bolderdash &lt;br /&gt;* Cranium &lt;br /&gt;* Cards (for various card games)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring any other game you might think 4 - 6 people at least could play at the same time. Team games would be great too. Note this is an indoor game night. We are not doing horseshoes or lawn darts! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Food&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplied already: &lt;br /&gt;* Paper and glass products &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please plan to bring to share any of: &lt;br /&gt;* Finger food &lt;br /&gt;* Snacks &lt;br /&gt;* Small entree (plan to feed 8 people!) &lt;br /&gt;* Drinks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hall Rental Donation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would appreciate donations of any amount (maybe $2 - $5 each person?) to help offset the cost of the hall rental. Donations can be made at the event. (We really appreciate the donations at the last event and we were able to cover the rental. Thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is at a hall at a condo complex in South Windsor.  The address will be sent to those who respond &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; about a few days before the event. Limitation on RSVP's is due to parking limitations. We all hope you can attend and enjoy a warm evening with great people. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kevin S</member_name><member_id>2499916</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Janice</member_name><member_id>3804430</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>7</waitlist_count><updated>1266618759000</updated><rating><average>4.71999979019</average><count>25</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>56</yes_rsvp_count><created>1263216563000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter Game Night and Party</name><id>12285518</id><headcount>58</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1265497200000</time><rsvp_limit>58</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/12285518/</event_url></item>
