Hot dips are welcome though ;) BYOB&lt;br /&gt;I will email my address, and telephone number, to all who say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; 24 hours prior to the event.  &lt;br /&gt;Parking on the street should be on the side my house is on only! You may park on the lawn if there's no snow on it, or in the driveway if there is room.&lt;br /&gt;Hope all your Holidays are Happy and filled with friends and family!!!&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas and&lt;br /&gt;hugs,&lt;br /&gt;susan&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>susan tisbert</member_name><member_id>3950284</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292792449000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
