I will be in Lexington in the morning so I figure I will make it simple and steal Greg's idea for next weekend.  The weather is suppose to be sunny and in the 30's. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in the main parking lot for the visitor center. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/mima/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nps.gov/mi...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving the visitor center, explore the Battle Road Trail. This five mile trail connects historic sites from Meriamâ€™s Corner in Concord to the eastern boundary of the park in Lexington. The main theme of the trail is the Battle of April 19, 1775, that launched the American Revolution. More over, the trail interprets the broader human story of the people whose lives were altered by the events that took place here. Much of the trail follows original remnants of the Battle Road; other sections leave the historic road to follow the route of the Minute Men, traversing farming fields, wetlands, and forests.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235232121000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1234553392000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Battle Road Trail walk</name><id>9736764</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1234807200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/9736764/</event_url></item>
