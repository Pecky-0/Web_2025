My name is Sonali.  I just moved to MA from Maryland for job.  I discovered your group at Meetup and thought it would be nice to know some New England indians.  I currently live in E. Arlington and work in Waltham.  </bio><topics><topics_item><id>4422</id><urlkey>socialnetwork</urlkey><name>Social Networking</name></topics_item></topics><name>Sonali</name><lang>en_US</lang><id>4612086</id><country>us</country><other_services /><city>Arlington</city><link>http://www.meetup.com/members/4612086</link><visited>1213284555000</visited><lon>-71.16</lon></member>
