Of course, there are quite a few movies today that can also be called entertaining, but they often achieve this with a combination of sex, violence and (admittedly) amazing special effects. It is rare to see a movie essentially devoid of such things that not only does entertain you, but also uplifts your spirit and leaves you with a positive feeling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has many memorable and well-acted scenes as the setting switches back and forth between ancient Nepal (the story of Buddha) and the contemporary search for the lama's teacher. It will educate you on the historical Buddha and his spiritual journey to enlightenment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Buddhist Film Festival 2010 will show two movies this winter: Baraka on January 27 and Little Buddha on February 24. Both showing will be at 7:00 p.m. The Buddhist Film Festival explores Buddhist culture is part of our Buddhism 101 Course and is open to the general public free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All movies are offered to the larger community at the Buttonwood Tree Performing Arts and Cultural Center at 605 Main Street, Middletown, Connecticut. &lt;a href="http://www.buttonwood.org/cgi/calendar.pl" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.buttonwood...&lt;/a&gt;. There is plenty of free street parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little Buddha, 1993, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci starting Keanu Reeves and Bridget Fonda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Buddha" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Buddha" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the Connecticut Valley Buddhist Film Festival? As part of our Buddhism 101 Course, it showcases cinemagraphic works that explore the Buddhist religious experience or take on Buddhist spiritual themes. Two movies have been shown in the autumn of 2009 and at least two will be shown in the winter/spring of 2010 in Middletown, Connecticut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Film Festival 2010 includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visitor – March. This 2009 film did not get nearly enough attention- even though Richard Jenkins received Best Actor nomination for his performance.  The theme of film is &amp;quot;just connect&amp;quot;. It is a beautiful story of what can happen when lives intersect and people are willing and able to drop their story lines- and &amp;quot;just connect.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody Loves Me - April&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Blossoms – May. This film is directed by Doris Dorrie, a German Buddhist film maker- who also directed How to Cook Your Life. It takes place in Japan during very special cherry blossom season. It deals with life/death with Buddhist concepts subtly interwoven. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope you can attend and lend support to our sangha and Buddhist culture.
