The range lies north of Route 113 and stretches from Holderness in the southwestt to Sandwich Notch Rd in the northeast. For this hike we'll start on route 113 at the Mt. Morgan trail head to the summit of Mt Morgan (2,220) pick up the Crawford- Ridepole Trail (which spans the whole range) and head northeast toward Mt. Percival (2,212.) We can head down from here to complete a loop hike of about 4.8 miles. Option: If the weather, our conditioning and will permit we could continue on the Crawford-Ridgepole Trail to the next summit, Mt. Squam (2,223.) Returning to the car from this peak would give us a hike of about 7.2 miles.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dennis </member_name><member_id>8755592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1328622627000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1327259370000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Squam Range (Mt's Morgan &amp; Percival)</name><id>49146612</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1328364000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/49146612/</event_url></item>
