&lt;p&gt;Since our sugested December meetup falls right smack in the middle of the busiest week for The Meadows, I am going to skip December and schedule our next meet for January 8th, from 2-4 pm, at the Meadows.&amp;nbsp; In the meanwhile, if there is another warm day forecast for a Sunday, I might have a short notice &amp;nbsp;outdoor meet in Newton at the beautiful conservation area that we met in September.&amp;nbsp; I will do this whenever I can because I know so many of you have requested outdoor meets.&amp;nbsp; But in the meanwhile, we will continue meeting at the Meadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am reinstating the no-charge policy we had a year ago since so many of us have been hit hard by the problems of the US economy.&amp;nbsp; But I will continue to ask everyone who can do so to bring a folding chair to the meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for not attending this past Sunday's meetup.&amp;nbsp; I am experiencing back spasms from having worked on moving 10 rooms worth of furniture, possessions etc. a couple of weeks ago, with the help of friends.&amp;nbsp; I guess I overdid it, thinking that i am still 25 years old, which is not true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small dog hugs,&lt;/p&gt;
