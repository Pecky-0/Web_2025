Not enough words to describe them. He draws a loyal set of fans that follow him around town.  Find out why this Friday at Atwood's. Sorry for the short notice but saw him for the first time this week and had to share!!  I watched him at another venue without a dance floor, but people just couldn't sit still and made room!     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check him out: &lt;a href="http://www.timgearan.com" target="_blank"&gt;Tim Gearan's website&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE: Good reasonably priced food &amp;amp; drinks at this no cover charge venue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atwoodstavern.com" target="_blank"&gt;Atwood's Tavern&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO:  Tim (event organizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW:  How will you find the group?   Go up to the bartender and say 'The crow flies eastward on a cloudy day.'  (Kidding.  look for &lt;a href="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/7/8/f/e/highres_2190974.jpeg" target="_blank"&gt;me.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN: This Friday, 9-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY:  Do we really need a reason?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PLAN:  Plan?  We don't need no stinkin' Plan! Stroll on in anytime after 8, have a few drinks and munchies and  shoot up the bull until 10 when the the band kicks in.  All that's left... as the saying goes... HAVE A DAMN GOOD TIME!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beantown and Beyond</member_name><member_id>4494456</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192572478000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>beantownandbeyond</urlname><id>553596</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Beantown and Beyond 25-40 Something Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1190227554000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Gearan Up @ Atwoods!</name><id>6390222</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190419200000</time><rsvp_limit>13</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/beantownandbeyond/events/6390222/</event_url></item>
