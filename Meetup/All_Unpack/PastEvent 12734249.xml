Did he eventually become a humanist? Can we count him among our humanist fore-bearers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A founding member of our organization, Rev. Dr. Robert Rafford is a semi-retired Unitarian Universalist minister, officiating at weddings, funerals and other events. He is a professional genealogist and the president of the Middlebury Historical Society and is Municipal Historian for the town of Middlebury. He was converted to humanism at the 1979 Unitarian Universalist Association General Assembly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll start with a half hour of coffee and conversation at 7:30 PM. The main talk will follow brief announcements at 8:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about this event and others, please read the write-up on &lt;a href="http://www.cthumanist.org/" target="_blank"&gt;our home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will most probably be in the Social Hall near the main entrance.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>richard.s</member_name><member_id>1140524</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Carol Siddall</member_name><member_id>1140632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269225806000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Humanists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>cthumanist</urlname><id>80394</id><group_lat>41.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9300003052</group_lon><name>The Humanist Association of Connecticut</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267384451000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Monthly Meeting - Celebrating William Lloyd Garrison</name><id>12734249</id><headcount>30</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1268695800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/cthumanist/events/12734249/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/a/global_5196186.jpeg</photo_url></item>
