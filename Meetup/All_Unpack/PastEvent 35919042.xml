<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;We've covered northern Italy and discovered some great white wines, now let's head south and see what the rest of the country has to offer.&amp;nbsp; Our first stop is a little vague since central Italy is perhaps best known for its red wines.&amp;nbsp; However, Noelle may have found something interesting on her recent trip to Italy so let's get together and see what Central Italy has to tantalize our taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appetizers welcome--please email me if you'd like to bring something.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Noel</member_name><member_id>8463776</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1319215585000</updated><rating><average>4.80000019073</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>White Wine Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>1441608</id><group_lat>42.5900001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>The MetroWest White Wine Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1317647160000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Giro d'Italia leg #5: Central Italy</name><id>35919042</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1319151600000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-MetroWest-White-Wine-Meetup-Group/events/35919042/</event_url></item>
