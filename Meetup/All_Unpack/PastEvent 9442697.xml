Hope everyone read the Great book Lisa chose for us! I can't wait to hear what everyone's reveiws are. For all our new members that would like to attend this would be a perfect time, because we will choose a new book at this meet up.This is a free gathering but we ask everyone to bring something light and refreshing to snack on. &lt;br /&gt;Hope to see everyone soon, (Rain thought she would be away until Thursday but she will be here on Wed, so since everyone is having a problem making Thursday meet up I change it back to Wed)&lt;br /&gt;Sue&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1235769665000</updated><rating><average>4.82999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>women</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY</urlname><id>1248021</id><group_lat>41.8800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7699966431</group_lon><name>Larches Inn Women's Exchange Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231104694000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Larches Inn Bookclub</name><id>9442697</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1231977600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/LARCHES-INN-SISTERHOOD-COMMUNITY/events/9442697/</event_url></item>
