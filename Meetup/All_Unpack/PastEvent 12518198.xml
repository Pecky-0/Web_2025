The format will be roundtable discussion. We use this informal format to promote our latest iPhone app or planned iPad app or simply to ask for opinions/help about an app you are working on. About 15 minutes per person works out. There's not enough time for everyone to present but generally not everyone wants to present. I'll keep track of time so we can cover as many topics as possible in the two hours we have the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the smaller conference room on the second floor of the Acton Public Library reserved. I will try to get a projector but the library web site claims projectors are for use in the large conference room only so don't count on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's room for about 12 people so RSVP only if you know you can attend and come early to get a seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Gonzalo Castro&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Gonzalo Castro</member_name><member_id>4359631</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1267142935000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>iOS Developers &amp; Fanatics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>nwiphone</urlname><id>1240376</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>Greater Boston iOS Developers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1265301082000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>iPhone Dev Roundtable</name><id>12518198</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1266969600000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/nwiphone/events/12518198/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/d/6/global_4989286.jpeg</photo_url></item>
