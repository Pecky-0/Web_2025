We had so much fun, we thought we'd do it again. Our next gala is sure to out do the last. I encourage you to rsvp early as we have limited characters available. You cannot rsvp maybe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So put on your crazy outfits and step out of reality for a while and let go of your worries. &lt;br /&gt;There will be prizes awarded for best costume, best sleuth, best actor/actress.&lt;br /&gt;Lori Larsen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fee is $25 so contact Lori at 203-933-2200 or in the Members section&lt;br /&gt;for registration and pament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being from West Haven, I am aware of the parking &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems on Campbell Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also aware of parking areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That others might not be aware of or use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, I use the large parking area that is behind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lori's store. I was using that parking area over a decade ago &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long before Lori even moved into that store. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Campbell Avenue, turn into the side street&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of Curtis Place next to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marc Anthony's Pizza Italian Restaurant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Restaurant has had a few different names over the years &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is it's latest name.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a large parking area behind there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to Campbell Avenue, you can walk over towards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marc Anthony's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then turn right on Campbell Avenue to Lori's store. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walk over toward the right from the parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an alley between the buildings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Campbell Avenue, I turn left. Lori's store is a few stores in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a fun Meet Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lookatmenow22.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.lookatmeno...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.lookatmenow22.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.catchahealthyhabit.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.catchaheal...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.catchahealthyhabit.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Lori Larsen is POC.
