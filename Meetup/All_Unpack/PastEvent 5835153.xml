It offers an eclectic menu, extensive  beer and cocktail choices, and an array of music nightly.  &lt;br /&gt;As one might expect from a place called the British Beer Company, they offer an unparalleled selection of beers, ales, lagers, stouts and pilsners from the UK, Ireland and Europe. They also sell the cream of American brew too-from the big national brands we all love on game day, to some of the more unique craft brews produced with love and fanaticism by the country's best microbrewers.  Whether it's a smooth, classic British ale, a rich stout, a crisp Belgian Abbey brew or a bracing IPA from the good old U.S. of A., there is no better place to hoist a pint and offer &amp;quot;Cheers!&amp;quot; all around than the British Beer Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit their website for a complete menu listing:  &lt;a href="http://www.britishbeer.com/local/pembroke/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.britishbee...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event date:  Saturday, June 23 6:30PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The British Beer Company&lt;br /&gt;15 Columbia Road&lt;br /&gt;Pembroke, MA&lt;br /&gt;781.829.6999&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event organizer: Jen&lt;br /&gt;Event Fee: $2pp&lt;br /&gt;Prices range between $6-$20&lt;br /&gt;RSVP Deadline: 4:00PM on Thursday, June 21 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring cash.
