<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, we label our game nights for what types of games will be played: party games, strategy games, word games, etc. Tonight will be an anything goes kind of night. Want to play Dominion and Taboo? Great. We'll let the crowd decide what gets played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our game closet is stocked, but if you have a new or favorite game, please feel free to bring it, especially if you got this this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to bring a favorite snack or drink for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* You should know that we are a household with a cat, but he will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to two small children, who will hopefully be in bed by the event start time, but either may make an appearance during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
