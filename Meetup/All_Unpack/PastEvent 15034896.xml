Green fees are $43 plus $15 for cart.  This course was really nice when I played it a few years back and I keep hearing good things about it.  If the trees have changed we should have some good views too as its on the hilly side.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're interested, please rsvp as soon as possible as I have to give them a definite count by tomorrow at 3pm so they can sell the spots if we're not using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there,&lt;br /&gt;Cindi 339-224-1377&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>around the club house 15 minutes to T time</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cindy</member_name><member_id>5281885</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287855014000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>golf-260</urlname><id>1127024</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2200012207</group_lon><name>The Boston and Beyond Golf Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1286468748000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Meadows at Peabody</name><id>15034896</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286636400000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/golf-260/events/15034896/</event_url></item>
