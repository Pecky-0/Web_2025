Absolutely beautiful quiet, shady country lanes punctuated by water courses orchards, horses, and scenic vistas.&amp;nbsp; Two sustained climbs but nothing insurmountable and the rewards are a pair of lovely descents.&amp;nbsp; One of them goes by the Nashoba winery and brewery, if we hit it right it could be a PERFECT place for a lunch or cliff bar break to enjoy the view over the orchards.&amp;nbsp; I think it makes sense to start early and depending on the size of the group we'll try to keep an average speed around 15mph.&amp;nbsp; That average will likely have a wide sigma however and will be at times as high as 20 or as low as stopped (just a heads up).&amp;nbsp; We'll rally frequently and as needed to keep the group close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weston Center has a good amount of parking at this time on a Sunday so it shouldn't be an issue.&amp;nbsp; There is a Bruegger's Bagels Bakery a bit up the road from the meeting spot if folks need breakfast/bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue sheet is in the group files ("More" menu above then "files").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd expect to finish by say 1 or 2pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to bring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Road bike in good working order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flat kit (Spare tube, tire levers, patch kit, frame pump or CO2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sunblock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pocket food&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sports drink (plenty of it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ca$h to replenish any of the above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
