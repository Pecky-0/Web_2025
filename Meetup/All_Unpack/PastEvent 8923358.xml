One of our members, John, has graciously offered to host the tasting at his loft.  Ricardo will come over and we will serve some well-paired cheeses to the wines being offered.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creme di Christi&lt;br /&gt;Taurisi&lt;br /&gt;Alianico&lt;br /&gt;Flanghia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, we will walk over and have dinner at Ricardo's place where the chef will prepare a special entree to complement the wine tasting.  Of course, you can also order off the menu if you that is your preference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there! Directions and specific location information to John's loft in Lowell will be provided to guests who have RSVP'd for the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John's Loft</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 3552363</member_name><member_id>3552363</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1225579652000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1223487955000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lost Wines of Italy</name><id>8923358</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1224887400000</time><rsvp_limit>6</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/8923358/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/f/global_5427151.jpeg</photo_url></item>
