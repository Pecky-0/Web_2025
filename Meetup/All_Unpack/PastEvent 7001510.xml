If you only use the Meetup RSVP system, then you won't be registered. Thank you for understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special note: the last event hosted by WRNEC was overbooked and some folks had to be turned away. I am sorry that this happened. The venue has been changed to a location that holds 50% more people, which should eliminate this problem going forward for some time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featured Speakers: Dr. David Carmos and Dr. Shawn Miller are the authors of the best-selling book on natural living foods, YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD TO BECOME YOUNG. These popular speakers from La Jolla, California, will give their inspiring new presentation &amp;quot;Forever Young, Forever Healthy&amp;quot; They will bring a video to be shown at 5:30, The video is an interview of Dr. Ann Wigmore conducted by her long time friend, Dr. David Carmos in May 1991, in San Diego. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drs. Shawn and David have developed their own theory on how to reverse the aging process. Their presentation is packed with revolutionary information: the latest scientific research on the whole raw food diet; the main causes of the killer diseases, and how to reverse them by natural means; staying on a raw diet; staying on a raw diet in the midst of our daily and common temptations; how to go on a transitional and cleansing diet healthfully; common errors that occur on a raw food regimen; the most important foods to eat to attain and maintain health; And much more!  Come and Be Motivated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those attending are requested to bring a raw, organic, unprocessed, non-animal, non-honey based ready- to-serve dish for 6 - 8 people. Please bring serving utensils labeled with your name on them.
