<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Every year Sharon puts on some spectacular fireworks on the 3rd. The same company that does the Esplanade does Sharon's. I live 5 houses from the fireworks and would love if you would join me. You can either walk down to the rotary with your chair (BRING A CHAIR) or watch from my yard. You do not have to go onto the sand to see the fireworks as they are visable from the street down by the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring an appetizer or a dessert. Please check to see what others are bringing so we don't have too many duplicates. I will have some soda but if you want wine or beer or some other libation, bring it and bring to share. I have invited others who are not part of our group so I need to limit this to the first 20 who reply. Please, also let me know what you are bringing and please bring it. We will be counting on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is across the street at the high school. If the police stop you, say you are going to 184 for a party. If the cop says you can't, he is kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look forward to seeing you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ellen</member_name><member_id>390908</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341763625000</updated><rating><average>4.88999986649</average><count>9</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston</urlname><id>425314</id><group_lat>42.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1699981689</group_lon><name>Jewish Singles 55+  of Greater Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>17</yes_rsvp_count><created>1340723389000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Watch the Fireworks on July 3rd (Tuesday night)</name><id>70803042</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341358200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/JewishSingles50-of-GreaterBoston/events/70803042/</event_url></item>
