[b]Update[/b]

The time of the movie is 7:50. I strongly encourage folks to buy tickets ahead of time at fandango.com. 

This is not a 3-d showing. I like the IMAX 3d but what they show at the Boston Common theater gives me a headache. And the tickets are $4 extra.

I will be wearing my red meetup hat, and I will be in the theater lobby by 7:10. We should walk in to get seats at 7:30. If the movie is upstairs, I'll be waiting by the tables at the front of the lobby in front of the giant window. If the movie is downstairs, I will be just behind the ropes across from the concession stand. If you miss the group before the movie, no worries, you can meet us after. We gather outside the doors of the room showing the movie afterwards. Then we head out for some munchies and a beer. Or two.

[b]Synopsis[/b]

From Disney•Pixar comes "Up," a comedy adventure about 78-year-old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, who finally fulfills his lifelong dream of a great adventure when he ties thousands of balloons to his house and flies away to the wilds of South America. But he discovers all too late that his biggest nightmare has stowed away on the trip: an overly optimistic 9-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. From the Academy Award®-nominated director Pete Docter ("Monsters, Inc."), Disney•Pixar's "Up" invites you on a hilarious journey into a lost world, with the least likely duo on Earth. "Up" will be presented in Disney Digital 3-D™ in select theaters.
