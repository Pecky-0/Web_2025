AU President Rev. Barry W. Lynn will keynote the speakers which include Katherine Stewart, Ellery Schempp, and Jessica Ahlquist, on Saturday evening April 13 at 6:30 pm at the Community Church of Boston, 565 Boylston St, Boston 02116 (near Arlington Street).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic will be "Separation of Church and State in Our Public Schools." Katherine Stewart is author of "The Good News Club: The Christian Assault on America's Children." Ellery Schempp, President of the Massachusetts Secular Coalition for America and the primary student involved in the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case declaring public-school-sanctioned Bible readings unconstitutional will also speak, as will current Humanist heroine and activist, Cranston RI's young atheist Jessica Ahlquist.&lt;/p&gt;
