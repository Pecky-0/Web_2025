Manifesting is bringing into your life what you most want to realize, experience and enjoy. Depending upon who you are and where you are on your life journey, determines what you are interested in manifesting. There is no right or wrong when we contemplate what it is we want to bring into our life.  Common examples of manifesting are: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• a fulfilling career&lt;br /&gt;• a home&lt;br /&gt;• a loving relationship with a partner&lt;br /&gt;• financial abundance&lt;br /&gt;• joy&lt;br /&gt;• a meditation practice &lt;br /&gt;• peace of mind&lt;br /&gt;• a clean environment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the truth is, we are manifesting all of the time, whether we are aware of this or not. So, wherever you are on your manifesting journey, consider this exciting opportunity to explore your manifesting mastery with the principles of Imagination Made RealTM.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Manifestation as an Integral Life Practice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… is a group experience to enjoy in person at Samadhi, Integral Life Practice Center located in Newton.
