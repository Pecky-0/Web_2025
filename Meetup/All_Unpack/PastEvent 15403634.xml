Tubing here is great as you don't have to walk back up the hill..We can hit a restaurant afterwards if interested. I was thinking Ruby Tuesdays in Worcester would be good. Make suggestions where you would like to go when you rsvp. If you are not interested in tubing maybe you could meet us for lunch. Rsvp now! We are joining my other group of FUN folks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1298133216000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289403263000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>WARD HILL - TUBING!</name><id>15403634</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1297522800000</time><rsvp_limit>35</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/15403634/</event_url></item>
