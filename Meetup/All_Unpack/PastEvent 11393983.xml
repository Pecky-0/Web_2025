I'm a big fan of German films, and if you are too this should be a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, The Baader Meinhof Complex dramatizes the history of the real-life West German terrorist group Red Army Faction (RAF), which rose to violent action against the German political status quo in the late 1960s. Led by Ulrike Meinhof (Martina Gedeck), a prominent journalist who forfeited her career and children to engage in anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist acts of resistance, and Andreas Baader (Moritz Bleibtreu), the group's youthful members went underground, sacrificing leading normal lives, to fight for a more human society—through terrorist bombings and bloodshed. These were the radicalized children of Germany's Nazi generation and they were hell-bent on never allowing anything like Nazism to rise to power again. The man who understands them is also their hunter: the head of the German police force (Bruno Ganz). Written and produced by Bernd Eichinger (Downfall) and directed by Uli Edel (Last Exit to Brooklyn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The movie, directed by Uli Edel, is swift, brutal, lurid, often overheated, and occasionally comical, but it’s also a serious, well acted, and unromantic exploration of the rise and demise of a terrorist gang whose radicalism ultimately reached beyond the young men and women who set it in motion.&amp;quot;  3 stars, Boston Globe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Intricately researched and impressively authentic slice of modern German History, with a terrific cast, assured direction, and a cracking script.&amp;quot;  82 percent on the Tomatometer -- Rotten Tomatoes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the film I'll be near the front of the theater with a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291949575000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1253159342000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Baader Meinhof Complex</name><id>11393983</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253392200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/11393983/</event_url></item>
