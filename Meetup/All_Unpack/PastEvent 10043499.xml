Remember, we'll be starting at 3pm and will go until 6pm, including a brief discussion at the end about what we all learned. Please remember to be on time for this, and bring your pencils and calculators!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have one 202 board and at least two 101 boards. As we've mentioned before, 202 is much more complicated than 101 and involves a STRONG knowledge of the principles that lead to success in 101. This includes being able to accurately and quickly make changes to your Financial Statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the 202 board will be restricted to only those who have gotten out of the Rat Race at least FIVE times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please call my cell (617-519-3163) if the doors are locked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of parking on Hemenway Street. There are resident signs for Fenway, but I haven't been ticketed the last three times we've met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Room 150</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Russ</member_name><member_id>3610750</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241373114000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Will-Be Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>BostonCashflowMeetup</urlname><id>302998</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>Boston Cashflow Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238098527000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>April 19 Cashflow Meetup</name><id>10043499</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240167600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonCashflowMeetup/events/10043499/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/8/global_1225096.jpeg</photo_url></item>
