By the mid '70s he was already regarded as one of the foremost documenters of the scene working with major attractions such as John Lennon &amp;amp; Yoko Ono, Tina Turner, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Elton John and Kiss as well as covering the emerging New Wave and Punk bands including The New York Dolls, Patti Smith, The Clash, The Sex Pistols, The Ramones and Blondie. Check out his web site: &lt;a href="http://www.bobgruen.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bobgruen.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free with Museum admission. Museum Admission is $10.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are enjoying the Rock and Roll photo shows at the Museum, you may want to consider becoming a member, there are a lot of events around this show that are wonderful- this lecture is just one- but if you are a member you pay a one time fee of 65.00 instead of many little fee to each event... Its a great deal for you and it helps support the museum so they can continue to bring in these great events and shows. If you do sign up to be a member please please tell them it was at Donna Dufault's suggestion. I don't get any kick backs or anything but I want them to know the Worcester Photo Center came out to support the WAM!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna Dufault</member_name><member_id>1714904</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1272392441000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Photographers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>photo-22</urlname><id>120247</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.7699966431</group_lon><name>Worcester Alliance of Photographers - AKA: WAP</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1270306568000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Artist Talk: Bob Gruen-One of the most well-known rock&amp;roll photographers</name><id>13075855</id><headcount>1</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1272218400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/photo-22/events/13075855/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/8/3/global_14097971.jpeg</photo_url></item>
