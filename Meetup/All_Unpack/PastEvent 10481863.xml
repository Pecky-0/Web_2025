Some of their mediums include glass, clay, fabric, metals, and wood. The work of these artists is the highest quality and craftsmanship. In addition to finished works, some artists have works-in-progress at the show, to demonstrate their skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, go to www.guilfordartcenter.org, and click on the &amp;quot;Events&amp;quot; tab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admission is $7.00 for adults; Guilford Art Center members are free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there are several entrances, let's meet on the sidewalk in front of the Guilford Free Library, across from the green. If anyone is interested, we can grab a bite to eat afterwards at Chip's Pub - about 5 minutes from the craft expo.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249081030000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1243175773000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Guilford Craft Expo 2009</name><id>10481863</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247943600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/10481863/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/0/global_4722752.jpeg</photo_url></item>
