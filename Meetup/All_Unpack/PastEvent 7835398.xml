There should be about 50 people from various groups going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Jake's Dixie Roadhouse website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jakes-bbq.com/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jakes-bbq....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake's is terrible with updating their website, so the music listing is not posted.  However, according to the Boston Blues website, Lisa Marie is playing.  I've never heard her (or them), but I'm game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the Boston Blues website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonblues.com/cal.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonblue...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people from the other Meetup groups are planning to have a bite to eat at Watch City Tavern before going to Jake's.  I can't go to Watch City, but you can.  This event is posted on 5 different groups.  I know for sure that it's posted on Boston Blues and New England Brews and Blues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My cell # is 617-999-9094.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>2969721</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1210641085000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>To listen to live blues.</why><group><who>Fans of Live Music</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-live-music</urlname><id>444171</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Live Music</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1209482634000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Blues at Jake's Dixie Roadhouse</name><id>7835398</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1210467600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-live-music/events/7835398/</event_url></item>
