Keeping fact, speculation, and contradiction playing off one another as the details unfold, author Lee Martin creates a fast-paced story that is as gripping as it is richly human. His beautiful, clear-eyed prose builds to an extremely nuanced portrayal of the complicated give and take among people struggling to maintain their humanity in the shadow of a loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminiscent of books such as The Little Friend and The Lovely Bones, but most memorable for its own perceptions and power, The Bright Forever is a compelling and emotional tale about the human need to know even the hardest truth.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Annie</member_name><member_id>1543974</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265247962000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paradisecityreaders</urlname><id>1404829</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6800003052</group_lon><name>Paradise City Readers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257295972000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>January Book Discussion: The Bright Forever by Lee Martin</name><id>11787886</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1262649600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paradisecityreaders/events/11787886/</event_url></item>
