<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;In preparation for our road trip to NH in January, we are having a sign making party this Sunday (12/18/11) at 3pm. Meetup members Shawn and Kayla have graciously offered us the use of their basement at their condo in Glastonbury (park in the visitor spots please). Bring any sign-making materials you may have (stakes, nails, paint, brushes, spray paint, tyvek, cardboard or other suitable backing). We have only ONE SHOT to make an impact with the voters of New Hampshire (and possibly a National TV audience) &amp;ndash; please attend this sign party if you can. Even if you can&amp;rsquo;t get to NH, you can contribute your artistic talents and help us spread Ron Paul&amp;rsquo;s message at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time for action is now, this may be our last chance at getting a candidate on the slate with the integrity of Dr. Ron Paul &amp;ndash; let's not let it slip by!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324399323000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1323830833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Ron Paul Sign Making Party</name><id>44393902</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324238400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/44393902/</event_url></item>
