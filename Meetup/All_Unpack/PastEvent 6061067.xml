We will hear about how permaculture crosses boundaries, whether they are geographical, political, personal or even spiritual in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Space is limited as this is being held in our home.  If you would like to attend and the RSVP list is full, pls email me and we may change venues if there is enough interest for a larger group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not be a potluck supper event, but perhaps we can make it a dessert/tea/coffee event..if you can contribute something, pls indicate in your RSVP notation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa Fernandes</member_name><member_id>2324592</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186873584000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Permies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>portlandpermaculture</urlname><id>215138</id><group_lat>43.6599998474</group_lat><group_lon>-70.2600021362</group_lon><name>Portland Maine Permaculture &amp; The Resilience Hub</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1185129999000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Permaculture Without Borders - A Special Meetup</name><id>6061067</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1186700400000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/portlandpermaculture/events/6061067/</event_url></item>
