David Fisichella learned how researchers study ocean physics and why; how people live for months at a time at sea and what it means to be working for, and dating, the Chief Scientist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;David Fisichella manages shipboard scientific services at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. His wife, Amy Bower, Ph.D., is a senior scientist at WHOI&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... This memoir was just published April of 2010. Ah! The age old stories of love, romance, the physics of the ocean, and being attacked by pirates. I gotta hear about this... And the &amp;quot;seven-tenths&amp;quot; part describes how much of the earth is covered by water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Registration Link&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;a href="http://support.neaq.org/site/Calendar/35735913?view=Detail&amp;amp;id=102721" target="_blank"&gt;http://support.neaq.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Meet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.J.

The Aquarium Lecture Series is presented free to the public through the generosity of the Lowell Institute, which has been providing funding for free public lectures at universities and museums since 1836.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Lectures are free and open to the public. Registration is requested. All programs start at 7 p.m. in the Aquarium's Harborside Learning Lab, unless otherwise noted below. Programs last approximately one hour followed by a reception&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to the Harborside Learning Lab:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing the main building of the Aquarium, the IMAX theater on the right, just before the IMAX theater there is a sidestreet with a row of offices on the right.
