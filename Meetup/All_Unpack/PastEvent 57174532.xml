Roger is well known on the New Hampshire Seacoast as a landscape, event, and street photographer. He will be exhibiting a wide selection of his work from the past five years, including photographs from the American West, Japan, New Hampshire's White Mountains and Seacoast, and the coast of Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't make it to the reception, the exhibit at the Seacoast Artist Association gallery runs from April 1st to May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snarky version: please come and eat some of the yummy snacks my wife is preparing for this reception. You can also look at my photos if you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roger Goun</member_name><member_id>3868036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334877565000</updated><rating><average>4.86000013351</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Photography Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>SeacoastPhotographers</urlname><id>1528260</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9899978638</group_lon><name>Seacoast Photographers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332285481000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Featured Artist Reception - Roger Goun</name><id>57174532</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334426400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/SeacoastPhotographers/events/57174532/</event_url></item>
