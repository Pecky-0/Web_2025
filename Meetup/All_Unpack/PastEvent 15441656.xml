It's technically an out-and-back hike, although we will incorporate two separate loops that will make the trip a bit more interesting.  Views from the fire tower on Pack Monadnock are spectacular.  There are also excellent views from North Pack as well as from several overlooks on the Cliff Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will meet in the main parking lot at Miller State Park at 9:00 AM.  &lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is a $4.00 Entrance Fee to Miller State Park.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller State Park is located on Route 101 in Peterborough, NH 03458.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note that dogs are not permitted on this hike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What:&lt;/i&gt;  Pack and North Pack Monadnock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Distance:&lt;/i&gt; about 7 1/2 miles round trip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elevation Gain:&lt;/i&gt; about 2400'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Difficulty:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pace:&lt;/i&gt; Moderate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exposure:&lt;/i&gt; Some exposure and open ledges on this route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book Time:&lt;/i&gt; 5 1/4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is This Hike for Me?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hike will be at a&lt;b&gt;moderate pace&lt;/b&gt;. We make every attempt to keep the group together throughout the hike.  We will gain about 2400' during the hike.  Expect several steep sections both up and down.  The views are spectacular.  There is some exposure on the Cliff Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To participate you should:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable hiking UPHILL at about 1.5 to 2.0 miles per hour at a 15% incline for about 4 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable walking &lt;b&gt;at least 8 miles&lt;/b&gt; on uneven terrain including roots, rocks, and granite ledges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have sturdy hiking boots suitable for cold weather.  &lt;b&gt;No Sneakers&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have rain and wind protection.  &lt;b&gt;No Ponchos&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be able to carry at least 2 liters of water. (Remember, 1 liter weighs 2 pounds!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be in good physical condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather and Trail Conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Microspikes&lt;/b&gt; -  Mid-December is winter in New Hampshire.  I fully expect to need some form of traction on this hike.  At least Microspikes will likely be necessary, although it is too early to predict as of this writing.  Please plan on bringing at least Microspikes.  I will update this section the week of the event if conditions require any more than that (i.e. Snowshoes.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Boots&lt;/b&gt; - Also, please note that this is the time of year where you need to transition out of your summer hiking boots and into a pair of winter hiking boots.  You do NOT need plastic boots for general hiking anywhere in NH, but you WILL need waterproof winter boots &lt;i&gt;comfort rated&lt;/i&gt; to at least -30 degrees.  (No, we don't typically encounter those temperatures, but boots with that rating will keep you warm while you're having your lunch on snow or ice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Water&lt;/b&gt; - Finally, you see the note below that your water must be in wide-mouth plastic bottles.  It is time to put your hydration systems - e.g. Camelbak's - away for the winter.  While they do sell insulated tubes for the hydration systems, quite frankly they do not work.  The entrance to the tube where it connects to the bladder still freezes, leaving you with a bladder full of inaccessible water.  Therefore, unless it is unseasonably warm for this hike, you'll need to carry water the old fashioned way.  Be sure to get wide mouth bottles and be sure to carry them upside down.  (Water freezes from the top down.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mandatory Equipment List as of 14 November 2010.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This list could change based on trail conditions just prior to the hike.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microspikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synthetic shirt and pants. &lt;b&gt;No cotton.  No jeans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sturdy Hiking Boots suitable for cold weather.  &lt;b&gt;No Sneakers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rain / Wind Jacket. &lt;b&gt;No Ponchos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm fleece layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 liters Water in wide-mouth bottles.  &lt;b&gt;No hydration systems!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headlamp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trail Snacks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optional Gear:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiking Poles - strongly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gaiters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen / Sunglasses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camera / Binoculars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: darkred"&gt;&lt;b&gt;No Jeans, Sneakers, or Cotton clothing on the hike! Due to the potential for early winter conditions this will be strictly enforced.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carpool Option&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are interested, we will meet in the parking lot at Lincoln Mall on Rte 116 in RI next to the McDonald's at 6:30 AM.  We will leave Lincoln Mall PROMPTLY at 6:45.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dining Options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch / Dinner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will plan to stop for lunch or dinner after the hike.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Providence, RI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take Route 146 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merge Right onto Route 290 East.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merge Right onto Route 190 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take Exit 31B for MA 12 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow MA 12 North to MA 31 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear Left onto NH 45 North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Left onto NH 101 West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right into Miller State Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trails and Other Info&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trail maps for this area are somewhat limited.  The best map available is the Wapack Trail Guide Map that comes with the trail guide itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Miller State Park main parking lot off Route 101 we will follow the Wapack Trail to the summit of Pack Monadnock.  There is a fire tower on the summit that is usually open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the summit, we will continue along the Wapack Trail until the junction with the Cliff Trail.  We'll take the Cliff Trail east since it affords some very nice views. The Cliff Trail rejoins the Wapack Trail at the summit of North Pack Monadnock where we'll enjoy our lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From North Pack Monadnock we'll return south along the Wapack Trail returning to the summit of Pack Monadnock.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the summit of Pack Monadnock we'll take the Marion Davis Trail back to the parking lot.  The Marion Davis Trail, while still steep in spots, is a much easier descent than the Wapack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contact Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide my cell phone number along with a link to a detailed trail map to all &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; RSVPs the week of the hike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liability Waiver&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a condition of your voluntary participation in this activity you acknowledge and agree to the following: this activity involves inherent risks that can cause property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death to participants and/or others; you assume all risk associated with this activity; you are responsible for having the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities, clothing, and equipment to safely participate in this activity; you know and will follow the Hiker Responsibility Code described at www.hikesafe.com; the leader(s) of this activity are volunteers; and you for yourself, your heirs, executors, and administrators release, hold harmless, and indemnify the leader(s) and all members of this group from any and all claims for property damage, injury, illness, disability, and/or death - including those caused by negligence and/or other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Grey Hyundai Sonata with RI License Plates.  </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Ron Correia</member_name><member_id>8033800</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292208882000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>adventurers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sports-26</urlname><id>1285971</id><group_lat>41.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5500030518</group_lon><name>RI Outdoors</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1289743932000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pack Monadnock &amp; North Pack Monadnock</name><id>15441656</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292076000000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sports-26/events/15441656/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/c/global_5586652.jpeg</photo_url></item>
