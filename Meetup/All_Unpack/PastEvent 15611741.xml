They all really seemed to enjoy the event, and all asked to have it done again. So, please join Steve O. and friends for a pleasant mornings stroll through the Currier Museum of arts in Manchester NH.. The museum offers Free Admission for everyone, every Saturday from 10am - 2pm. So, come view some of the fantastic works of art, meet some new people, and enjoy lunch afterwards with some great conversation. Steve O. is an Artist / Sculptor / instructor, and has his BA in Commercial Art. So, he will be happy to offer any insight he can into any of the works there. We may be lucky enough to even get a tour from the museum also.  After our museum walk, we will have something to eat in their beautiful cafeteria in the center of the museum. Bring your own food and drink, or just buy it there. Their food is a little pricy. But, it is so good!! &lt;br /&gt;Please contact Steve O. for my details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: There are also Family Saturdays. They are the second Saturday of the month: &lt;br /&gt;'Spend some quality family time at the Currier the second Saturday of every month. Participate in hands on&lt;br /&gt;art activities, go on a guided family gallery walk (11:30 am), visit the new&lt;br /&gt;Discovery Gallery, or use a family gallery guide. Each Family Saturday will focus on a different theme.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Call us at anytime 603-491-1962 and look for the Meetup sign I will be holding.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Ob1</member_name><member_id>3333572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1291480316000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
