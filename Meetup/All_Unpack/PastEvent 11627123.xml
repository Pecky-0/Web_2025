This results in people feeling ‘less than’ others or having to make themselves feel ‘better than’ others. In fact, if you could see yourself as your Creator sees you, you would know thoroughly that you are completely loved and accepted. This doesn’t mean there’s not work to do on yourself, but it does mean your heart can rest in the knowing that while you are doing the work, you are supported by the God of Love. Come and begin the journey toward love of God and self with Father Peter Bowes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.CentersOfLight.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258989026000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-226</urlname><id>262460</id><group_lat>42.3199996948</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4300003052</group_lon><name>Metro West Meditation Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255547911000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  Learning to Love Yourself</name><id>11627123</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258815600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-226/events/11627123/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/d/global_4477485.jpeg</photo_url></item>
