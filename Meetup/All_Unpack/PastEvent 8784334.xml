Looking for like-minded progressives to go apple picking with?  Are you new to the area and looking for groups to get involved in? Are you psyched about building strong cross-issue coalitions? Join us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're headed to Sterling, MA to experience a huge corn maze and lots of fun apple picking. Details below - &lt;b&gt;we will help arrange carpools&lt;/b&gt; from the Boston area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Davis Farmland in Sterling, MA, they build an &lt;b&gt;enormous corn maze&lt;/b&gt; every year.  The designer, Adrian Fisher, is a world-renowned/guiness record holder maze creater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year's theme is Olympic Gold and is unrivaled in terms of complexity. It contains miles of pathways, the most bridges in any field maze and includes the world's first and only double-decker bridge. As if that didn't make it complex enough, Davis' Mega Maze is the only field maze in the world that has the capacity to change every day. There are hundreds of ways to complete the maze and the experience will never be the same twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another first at Davis' Mega Maze is X-treme Mazing which offers extra goals, challenges and choices not found in a typical maze. In addition to the traditional meandering style of solving a maze, guests can now personally tailor their maze experience to their own level of intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This maze is designed for adults, although older children will enjoy it as well.  It can take anywhere from 35 minutes to 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost: Adult 13-59 $16.95,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kids 5-12 $12.95, Seniors 60+ $12.95,  Kids under 5 Free&lt;br /&gt;Additional information can be found at: &lt;a href="http://www.davisfarmland.com/megamaze/guest_info.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.davisfarml...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about the apple picking?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple Picking with a paid admission to Davis' Mega Maze:&lt;br /&gt;1/2 peck apple bag..........$7.00&lt;br /&gt;Full peck apple bag..........$13.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple picking only&lt;br /&gt;1/2 peck apple bag..........$12.00&lt;br /&gt;Full peck apple bag..........$18.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Socializing for Justice (SoJust) events you can hang out with friends, make new ones, find a date, get the scoop on a job, and find out what's going on this weekend - political or social.
