Highland Kitchen in hip Somerville offers an award-winning brunch, during which you can be entertained by Christine's husband/Gus's daddy Hank Williams* and his band!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP by Wednesday 3/14 so I can be sure to get a reservation. If you're not sure, RSVP yes then change to no later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't be late, because they will only seat complete parties. There is parking available behind the restaurant off Central St. There is also street parking on Highland. You will risk towing if you park in the other nearby lots. If you come early, Highland is fun to walk up and down, and there are a couple of playgrounds nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
