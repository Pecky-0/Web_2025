Discover how they can be applied to your daily life, relationships and work life. Our meetings are opened to all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help Me Other Power!&lt;/b&gt; The world of craving and desire can be so powerful that our will power is often not enough to overcome them. In this talk, we will discuss how to resist those cravings and desires, that get us into trouble, with the help of the Primal Vow of Amida, the Unhindered Light and Life.  We will explore how the nembutsu and simple mindfulness can keep us in touch with Other Power and grant us a powerful defense against wearisome craving and desire. Presented by Abhya Dharmapala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See our CALENDAR @&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bffct.net" target="_blank"&gt;www.bffct.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;REMINDER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; -  Hosted by the Buddhist Faith Fellowship.
