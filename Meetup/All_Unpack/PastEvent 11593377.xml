Singo will be on a weekday soon...&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I talked to Chris, and actually he has had GOOD experiences at Kumo as well as bad.  The decor is very chic modern.  The menu looks good.  Prices are reasonable.  And we can go get coffee at nearby Panera after (or ice cream, of course....if we can find a place).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kumojapanesecuisine.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.kumojapane...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kumojapanesecuisine.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am sorry for waiting so long to make the final decision.  I really want to go to Singo Sushi and hope to post a weekday trip there if anyone can do.  It is tiny and looks intimate and good, but they are not open on Sundays, and I can't imagine we could get in there on a Saturday.  Our group will take up 3/4 of  the dining area!  Stay tuned...&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kelly S</member_name><member_id>2538500</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258764129000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Sushi Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>sushi-ct</urlname><id>900540</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven County Sushi Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255144650000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Because it was a tie: Kumo Sunday Sushi!</name><id>11593377</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257116400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/sushi-ct/events/11593377/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/c/global_7885132.jpeg</photo_url></item>
