&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first step to Manifesting what you desire is to see your self as already there; seeing, feeling, &amp;amp; having that desired Outcome.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; But what if you are unclear or unsure about your outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then come to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ae3333"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WELL FORMED OUTCOMES/ ESSENTIAL MIND POWER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 with &lt;span style="color : #ae3333"&gt;Special Guest Speaker: Tom Maloney&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outcome thinking is a very powerful approach to achieving what you want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By following the steps to setting a well-formed outcome you are modeling the way many successful people think about their outcomes. &lt;br /&gt;

 This way of thinking works in all situations and at all levels, from setting an outcome for a five-minute discussion, to establishing a vision for a company. The success comes from ensuring that your vision meets all the conditions for a well-formed outcome, and each element is crucial to the eventual likelihood of success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom will speak about:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clarifying what it is that you desire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;State what you want in a positive sense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seek the evidence that tells you that you are on the right track&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Discover the resources that you need to achieve your desired outcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Understand your ability to take control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Put you plan into action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
