&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to be going to camp tonight but the road conditions are treacherous in the Berkshires and was told not to come until tomorrow morning. Now I have tonight open without a thing to do and the other gazzillion meetups I belong to have nothing scheduled either. So I thought Hey it would be a good night for a game night. I know it's last minute and all but if 1 or all of you want to come on over play a game or 2 or 3 - please do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the parking logistics please - first come first serve on the front parking spots. There is plenty of on street or parking at the funeral home and CVS parking lots. PPPLLLLEEAASSEEE No parking on the side of the house - Cranky neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some here, but snacky food is always welcome. BYOB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see some of you tonight. :)&lt;/p&gt;
