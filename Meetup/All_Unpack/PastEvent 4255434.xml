EMAIL ME if you want to go, as we are now meeting at my house at 10:00 am.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my co-workers and I have decided to take a road trip to Webs www.yarn.com on Monday.  We'll be leaving Concord, on Monday at 9:00 am, and we'll be meeting in the Borders parking lot.  I'll have two more spaces available in my car, or if other people want to meet us at Webs or arrange for another car to go, that's up to you.  I can try to coordinate a bit.
