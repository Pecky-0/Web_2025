It will be a Yankee swap... For every pug you own... bring one toy.  They do not have to be expensive... as we all know puggers love anything with a squeaky.  Some one brought a package of them... what a great idea..  Each pug will go home with a new toy.... Human treats or drinks would be appreciated... We have many new members and I am fostering a new baby to our group. Spunky. He already has an owner so don't ask...lol... but he is super... I am looking forward to seeing everyone; as it has been a long time since we have had a meeting.. I have chosen Sunday afternoon at 1:00. The Patriots Game is not on til 4:30... So all of you football fans can still come to the party and be home in time to watch the game... lol... or watch with Bob...lol.. Please RSVP.. It makes it easier on me if I know who is coming.... pug hugs Patty&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>patty</member_name><member_id>57327</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1168970567000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Pug/companion dog Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>pug-19</urlname><id>126389</id><group_lat>43.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4499969482</group_lon><name>Manchester New Hampshire pug/small dog meet up group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1168357699000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Yankee Swap Holiday Party</name><id>5378400</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1168797600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/pug-19/events/5378400/</event_url></item>
