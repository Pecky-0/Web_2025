&lt;p&gt;These are going to be ongoing twice weekly, in the evenings, open studios. Pat and I are aiming for Monday/Thursday evenings, but if there are other nights that work better, just let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may work on anything you want to, but if you're interested in putting paint on canvas, come and join us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rozsi</member_name><member_id>4028966</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1324676851000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1324305378000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Studio with a painting theme</name><id>44897662</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1324425600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/44897662/</event_url></item>
