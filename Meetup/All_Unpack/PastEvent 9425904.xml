Oskar (KÃ¥re Hedebrant) is a fragile, anxious boy, bullied too easily by his classmates, who finds relief from his aching loneliness when pretty Eli moves into his apartment complex in suburban Stockholm. But as the two become close friends, Oskar discovers that Eli might be a soulmate of a deadlier kind. Directed by Tomas Alfredson and written by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own bestselling novel to the screen- and also borrowed his title from a Morrissey song), this tale of love and alienation is enriched by the visual eloquence of its wintry setting and spiked with frequent bursts of offbeat humor. &amp;quot; This is a vampire movie like no other,&amp;quot; writes David Ansen of Newsweek. &amp;quot; ... it's (the filmmakers') psychological acuity that draws the deepest blood: this is a prepubescent love story for the ages.&amp;quot; In Swedish with English subtitles. Rated R for some bloody violence including disturbing images, brief nudity and language. (Sweden 2008) 114 min.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I have a meetup tatoo</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232885688000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230913965000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let the Right one in "(Lat den ratte komma in)"</name><id>9425904</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230941700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/9425904/</event_url></item>
