Come on out and join us Sunday at 12pm for some fun, laid back, frisbee.  We will be playing before the regularly scheduled 1pm coed games and feel free to stay for a full afternoon of BF frisbee. Weâ€™ll be on the lower soccer fields at Danehy. No dudes allowed. Not even if you wear a skirt and a wig, Joe, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned last month, we are trying to make this a monthly recurring event. And as demand pents up, we may increase the number of games per month. So...tell your friends! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/love.gif' border='0' alt='love struck' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the game plan:&lt;br /&gt;12:00 - Overview of the rules, safety, etc - then divide into teams&lt;br /&gt;12:15 - Play&lt;br /&gt;1:00 - Conclude play for the start of the regular 1pm games&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what we humbly ask of you (works great as a checklist):&lt;br /&gt;Arrive on time (RSVP is optional - but helpful for us)&lt;br /&gt;Bring LOTS OF WATER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, we will supply the frisbees, cones, first aid supplies (hopefully will never be used) and our pretty smiles. As we periodically mention, all these supplies are paid out-of-pocket by your loving Frisbee organizers and everyone has been so generous with their donations to-date. Thank you and let's keep the dream alive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara and Heather Jo&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>"See the About &gt; Boston Common page for map and directions"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Cara</member_name><member_id>7321267</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>heather</member_name><member_id>11092147</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1285649931000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Disc Lovahs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonfrisbee</urlname><id>501407</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Frisbee</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284392990000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Women Only: Sunday Daytime Ultimate @ Danehy Park</name><id>14752908</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1285516800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonfrisbee/events/14752908/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/7/global_14743831.jpeg</photo_url></item>
