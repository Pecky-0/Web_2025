Many hits from the 50'S, 60's, 70's and more. &lt;br /&gt;The band members are very sociable, sat with us.  We even had fun and played some R&amp;amp;R trivia &lt;br /&gt;with them! &lt;br /&gt;For those of you who were unable to join us, this is an event not to be missed! &lt;br /&gt;** POLCARI'S LOUNGE does get VERY crowded...especially when this band is in the house1&lt;br /&gt; But, if you aren't into crowds, this may not be the right venue for you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band's website: www.reminisants.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIME: 8pm ( music begins at 9) &lt;br /&gt;WHERE: We will be in the lounge&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask for the meetup group in the lounge.
