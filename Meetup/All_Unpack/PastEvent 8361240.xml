I will bring plates, cups, utensils, napkins, and (non-alcoholic) drinks.  I'll also have a few picnic tables handy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring some picnic-type food to share, and let me know what it might be when you RSVP for this month's meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no fee for this month's meetup, so come and bring family and kids and friends and anyone else who might be interested in being part of this community.  We'll get to know each other, perhaps play a few NLP-inspired games, talk about what we'd like to see in the meetups in the coming year, and just have a good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can all make it.  It has been a wonderful couple of years, and it couldn't have happened without you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Marx&lt;br /&gt;NLP Master Practitioner&lt;br /&gt;New Light NLP&lt;br /&gt;adam@NewLightNLP.com&lt;br /&gt;(508) 454-2261&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;New Light NLP - Helping you to become the you that you want to be:&lt;br /&gt;Counseling, Coaching, and Training&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS A reminder about the venue: &lt;br /&gt;We meet in front of Sturtevant Hall, 197 Herrick Road, which is near the library on the central quad of Andover Newton.&lt;br /&gt;Andover Newton Theological School is conveniently located in Newton Center, with free parking.
