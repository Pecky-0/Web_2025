<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Jim Plunket has been playing guitar for the past 20 years around the New England area.  Those of us who have gone to college in the New England area are very familiar with him. He plays the songs that everyone loves and knows by heart, and get's people to sing a long... real loud and with good cheer.  Every time I have seen him in the past it's always been a blast!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us for a fun, lively, and entertaining evening on Boston Harbor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* YOU NEEED TO BUY YOUR TICKET IN ADVANCE *&lt;br /&gt;** Tickets are $20.00 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Plunkett's Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jimplunkett-music.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.jimplunket...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.baystatecruisecompany.com/summer_music.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.baystatecr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cruise leaves from The World Trade Center Pier, &lt;br /&gt;Seaport Blvd, &lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to the pier:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.baystatecruisecompany.com/directions.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.baystatecr...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet at 6:30pm (at least we'll aim for that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can begin boarding at 7:00pm.
