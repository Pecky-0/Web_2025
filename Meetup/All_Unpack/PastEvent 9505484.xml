The type who's more passionate than the players more knowledgeable than the coaches, and more demanding than that meddling baseball owner from New York? Do you crave a lot more than a couple of TVs, some old sports memorabilia and deep fried everything? Then you shall have it. Game On! is about the fan and for the fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    We invite you to be our guest. Game On! is a multi-media entertainment destination where good company, great food, and the most up to date of everything come together like a 98-yard touchdown drive. With more HD projection TVs than a Best Buy showroom, better sound than Carnegie Hall, a chef vs. a fry cook, the only gamer Crib Room of its kind and Fantasy Friendly wi-fi computer access, Game On! adds up to the best fan experience yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;There are still skyboxes available for the big game - call and book yours today!  Be sure to check out the food and drink specials they have going on as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Football Food &lt;br /&gt;Four Down's&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st down-Chips &amp;amp; Salsa&lt;br /&gt;2nd down-Homemade Chili&lt;br /&gt;3rd down-Buffalo wings&lt;br /&gt;4th down-Tailgate Platter with Steak Tips, Turkey Tips, Sausage, Pork Kebabs, French Fries and Coleslaw&lt;br /&gt;$100 (Feeds 4 people)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Meghan</member_name><member_id>7970205</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>12</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1234487224000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Social Networkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1382</urlname><id>1275022</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Things To Do: BOSTON</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1231779814000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Super Bowl at Game On!</name><id>9505484</id><headcount>9</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233525600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1382/events/9505484/</event_url></item>
