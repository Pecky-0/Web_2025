<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I am running the New York City Marathon this year, raising money for the BARKA Foundation - www.barkafoundation.org. Check out my website at www.howardsimpson.com. They help create wells for access to clean water in Burkina Faso, Africa - one of the poorest nations on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to some last-minute shuffling, there is AT LEAST ONE, possibly more open spaces on this small team. There is a fundraising commitment to be made, but there is still plenty of time to get the word out, and while I can't list specifics here, the fund-raising commitment is WAY LOWER than the big-name charities for this kind of race, so if you haven't tried fundraising before now might be your chance to try, for a great cause, and it without all the huge liability can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoot them an e-mail at: inaandesu@barkafoundation.org for more information! Again, ASAP. I will take this down when I hear the spots are filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1352034147000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Llama's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonruns</urlname><id>502534</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Boston Informal Running Club: Home of TMIRCE:BOS</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1348201694000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Open Spots on Team to Run the 2012 New York City Marathon!
