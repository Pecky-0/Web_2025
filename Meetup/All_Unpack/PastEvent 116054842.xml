If you have never been on it, why not give it a try.  Yes it is a Tarred Path !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distance to the Entrance of Colt State Park, is about 12 miles.  I plan to wait at the Entrance, for slower riders to catch-up. The Park is full of water views  and there are plenty of places for our break. Why not take a Break &amp;amp; Enjoy the Scenery. There are Restrooms, at Colt State Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We probably will split into a few groups.  Feel free to go at your own pace and whatever distance you feel comfortable with. You can always turn around if you start getting tired.  I am sorry, but unless the turnout is small, I will not be able to watch everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, I may ride toward  Providence.  There are a couple of Hills / Inclines, for Training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions:  Route 95 to Route 195 East, take Exit #5, Right on Warren, First Left on First Street.  At your second Stop Sign take a Right on Veterans Memorial Parkway. Follow Veterans Memorial Parkway  and you will see a Large Parking Lot on the Right.  I am not sure if the street # is 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: Exit #4 Ramp is closed.&lt;/p&gt;
