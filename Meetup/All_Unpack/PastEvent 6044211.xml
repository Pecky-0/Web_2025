This Meetup will focus who we get data in and out of Python applications.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to discuss you best and worst experiences -- querying minds want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In keeping with our discussion, the feature presentation is on STORM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Storm?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storm is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for Python developed at Canonical. The project has been in development for more than a year for use in Canonical projects such as  Launchpad, and has recently been released as an open-source product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher Armstrong of Canonical will walk us through this open source project. Sometimes called the International Man of Twistery, Christopher is also involved in the Twisted project.  This should be a great presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drop me a line if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter Marquez</member_name><member_id>4000314</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187392304000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Pythonistas</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonpython</urlname><id>469457</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Python User Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184803467000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Cambridge Python August Meetup</name><id>6044211</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187218800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/6044211/</event_url></item>
