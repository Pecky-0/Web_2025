It is mostly shaded. There are a few places off trail along the way the dogs can access the water. There is a pond at the turn around point where the dogs can swim. As this is a line hike (you come back the exact same way) on a easy to follow mostly straight trail any one getting to hot or tired before we reach the turn around point can easily find their way back to the parking lot.
