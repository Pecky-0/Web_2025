Come hang out with him and the Boston Skeptics as he talks about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Implausible Health Claims and Human Studies Ethics: A Collision Course&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;A broad international consensus regarding protections for subjects in human trials emerged during the 2nd half of the 20th century. It can be summarized in several tenets, most of which pertain explicitly or implicitly to scientific considerations. Recent projects involving human trials of implausible health claims (&amp;quot;CAM&amp;quot;) have been at odds with some of those tenets. I'll discuss one trial in detail and mention a couple of others. I will argue that all such trials are likely to be unethical.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/event.php?eid=108750899148755&amp;amp;index=1" target="_blank"&gt;Boston Skeptics facebook page&lt;/a&gt; for more information.
