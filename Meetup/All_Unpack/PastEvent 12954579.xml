This isn't square dancing, contra, or early American/Scottish dancing.  Instead, it's modern country line and couples dancing and it's danced to your favorite tunes you hear everyday on WOKQ.  It's alright if you're a beginner because at 7:30, the lessons start (included in the $10 cover charge).  Usually, 2 or 3 line dances are taught during this 1 hour lesson.  At 9pm, the band starts.  Count on several hundred fun, friendly people ranging in age from 21 to 80 every Saturday night and an atmosphere full of great energy and continuous dancing for 5 hours (7:30-12:30).  Just listening to the band and watching the skilled dancers is worth the trip!  We will meet at 7:30 to get a table.  Come later if you want.  Check out the details, driving directions, and all the photos on their website (midnightrodeobar.com).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where:    Midnight Rodeo Bar at The Yard in Manchester, NH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When:     Saturday, March 27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entrance:  From the well-lighted parking lot, walk to the cold-weather canopied entrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once inside:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave your coat on one of the chairs at tables located directly to the right of the wall-mounted TV and join us on the dance floor.  Periodically, we sit down to talk.  The rest of the time, we're out on the dance floor or conversing on the sidelines.  If you're not sure how to find our group, I'm one of the 2 or 3 tallest there and look like my photo.  Just say &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; and feel free to call me at (603)973-6609 before 7:30 to confirm event attendance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn line and couples dances including:  2-step, Waltz, El Paso, Carolina Stroll, 3-Step, Slappin' Leather, 16-Step, Tush Push, Billy, Cheeseburger, Marenguay, Trashy Women, Shadow, 1-Step, Sleazy Slide, Boot-Scoot-&amp;amp;-boogey, Cotton-eye Joe, etc., etc. (not all in one night!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors open at 7:00pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover charge $10.00 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dance Lessons 7:30 - 8:30pm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live Band  9:00pm - 12:30am&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Dixon Band:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Dixon is an up-and-coming singer/songwriter, whose style is a unique combination of smooth country vocals and southern rock. His personal talents have given birth to a new way of delivering that sweet country sound, with a heart-pumping, foot-stomping beat that can only be viewed as a bit spicy, smooth, southern country rock.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since your feet slide on the dance floor somewhat when doing this kind of dance, sneakers won't work too well.  Leather soles or just slippery soles (even if they're slippery sneakers) work best.  I will gladly instruct/lead some of the dances.  Dress code is more on the casual side, as seen in the website photos at midnightrodeobar.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Tall guy with glasses</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269906058000</updated><rating><average>3.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269265091000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Live country music and dancing -Midnight Rodeo Bar at The Yard in Manchester, NH</name><id>12954579</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269732600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/12954579/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/0/6/global_13522358.jpeg</photo_url></item>
