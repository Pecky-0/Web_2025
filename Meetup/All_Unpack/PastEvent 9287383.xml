I'll be in the very front of the line or in the middle, therefor I'll waive my hand and you can come stand where I am waiting to get in depending if nobody from the line argues about you coming to the front but I have done this lots of times with friends and guests. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Frost-Nixon-Trailer-9913.html" target="_blank"&gt;FROST/NIXON - Trailer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have a printer and would like me to make a copy for you.
