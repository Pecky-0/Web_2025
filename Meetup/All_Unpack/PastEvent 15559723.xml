Members requested that this party be for 46 plus age range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invite a gentleman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entry fee for this party is $25.00 and includes professionally catered food. If you want wine then be proactive like several people did at the last party. They contributed a bottle of wine. I thought that was class and quality combined.( some wine was valued at $15.00 plus) These are the altruistic members I want to attract for you to meet. We will find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our events are evolving to determine if I should offer two or three glasses of wine at a fee of $30.00. Or allow members to bring a bottle. I will get feedback after the next few parties. It will still be half the fee of comparative dating service offering food and wine at $70.00-$99.00. We will continue to offer the best value and quality. Comparative services offer no food or wine at $35-$45 presently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice the quality of people who attended the last party. I'm very happy. You will notice another higher level of quality will be achieved at this party.   Surprise! You will observe, Continuous improvement is a process. More improvements to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This party is for single individuals.(46 plus age) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mission is to have fun and meet other high integrity single people with common interests.
