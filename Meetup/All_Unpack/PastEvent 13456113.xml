Syracuse is currently atop the North Division standings at 18 - 11, and the Pawsox... well let's not dwell on the standings - it is still early in the season.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a &amp;quot;Family Fun Fest that will will feature PawSox Player Autograph Booths, a chance to meet PAWS &amp;amp; SOX, free samples &amp;amp; coupons, music, games for kids, and other surprise treats. The FanFest is available to all fans free of charge - after the game&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is free parking at the Stadium (and the school near it), and on many side streets around the stadium.  There are also many pay lots close to the stadium.  WARNING: Please pay close attention to all of the street signs because they will ticket/tow if you park illegally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game is at 1:05.  We will meet outside the box office around at 12:30.   If no-one objects we'll be going for the cheap seats, which are $7.  Perhaps we will choose to sit out on the grassy knoll if the weather is nice.  If you come late, send John an email/text to find out where we sit.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>John will be wearing a blue VPI hat (as long as I don't lose it before the game.) </how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Beth</member_name><member_id>8262222</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>8642703</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274058802000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>P-Collective Members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>newintown-995</urlname><id>1302228</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>The Providence Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1273627061000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pawsox vs Syracuse Chiefs</name><id>13456113</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1274027400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/newintown-995/events/13456113/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/6/0/global_14207984.jpeg</photo_url></item>
