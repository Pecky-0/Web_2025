First, we seat you at a table in one of our spacious cinemas. Depending on the cinema your movie is playing in, our tables are designed to accommodate 2 to 8 people. Your leather chair is the driver or passenger seat from a Limousine and will have one armrest, recline, and is on wheels. Next, why not check out our diverse menu. Your waiter or waitress will be around to take your order so you don't have to miss any of the good parts! Quench that thirst and grab a bite to eat. Our menu selections currently include beer &amp;amp; wine, (21 and over only) soft drinks, and a variety of pub-style food selections. Get there early and enjoy your meal before the movie starts. Most theaters will open at least an hour before the movie starts. You may also order throughout the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Pay Your Own Way Event, hope to see you there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Bart-&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be waiting by the front door. . . .</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1245460159000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1244599959000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Imagine That. . . .
