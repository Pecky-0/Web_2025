The now famous &amp;quot;Ultimate Cruise Night&amp;quot; offers the additional excitement of live local band entertainment and delicious Kimball Farm BBQ grill. Try to resist the Legendary Ice Cream Buffet. What better way is there to spend a Summer evening. Admission for the general public is $3.00 for adults and children under 12 are free. Car exhibitors &amp;amp; their passengers enter at no charge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kimballfarm.com/event.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.kimballfar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If rain cancels this event we will make it the following Thursday, June 14th. The event actually runs from 6-9 if you want to get there earlier. We will set a location to meet as the date nears. Kimball's also has mini golf, pitch and putt, bumper boats and a country store, so bring friends and enjoy. :-)&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sandy K</member_name><member_id>3926599</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273541503000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Fun loving peeps</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>realestatefordummies</urlname><id>458442</id><group_lat>42.7299995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3199996948</group_lon><name>Fun in So.
