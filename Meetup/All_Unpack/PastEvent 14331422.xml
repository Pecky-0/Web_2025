This will be an afternoon of pinball, video games, mini-golf, bowling, and possibly a train ride. I've heard very good things about this place and have been wanting to try it out for a while now. I hope you can join!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be waiting just outside the entrance or just inside if it's raining or super hot and humid like it has been at 1pm. I'll wait around for 15-20 minutes so we can connect up with the group, make our challenges (DDR anyone?), form mini-golf teams, and then disperse into the largest arcade in the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've had bad luck with arcade-based restaurants in the past, but if it looks decent, maybe we can regroup for an afternoon snack to fuel the gaming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a coupon on their website for free tokens if you buy $20 worth: &lt;a href="http://www.funspotnh.com/mws-coupon.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.funspotnh.com/mws-coupon.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.funspotnh....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is driving up with some empty seats in their car and is willing to drive a local sci-fi enthusiast, please say so in the comments. You can help out another group member and the environment by car-pooling at the same time :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention this is the largest arcade in the world!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn</member_name><member_id>9373103</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1281963237000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boston-scifi</urlname><id>1434288</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>The Boston Sci-Fi/Fantasy Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1281035625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Largest Arcade in the World!</name><id>14331422</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1281891600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boston-scifi/events/14331422/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/global_8154265.jpeg</photo_url></item>
