I had to move our reservation time up 30 min. to 2:30PM. This is to ensure that we get the special prefix lunch price. Late arrivals are permitted but it will be just a reg. bar menu only after 3PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:30 PM Table Seating is in the bar area just inside the front entrance. &lt;br /&gt;Please arrive by 2:25pm. I have reserved two tables 6 people each(max reserved in my name). Please call me by noon if you are running late or can't make it. Add ons are permitted to sit at the bar so friends are permitted to join us for cocktails and a bar menu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESTAURANT WEEK SPECIAL:&lt;span style="color: red"&gt; 3 Course PreFix menu for only 20 bucks!!(add 26.5% for tax and tip...so $25 bucks plus beverages)&lt;/span&gt; I have selected March 21st as  For &amp;quot;Fun with Alcohol&amp;quot; Members!!!

I 've asked him to make a cockatil which is less sweet than most cocktails and has  subtle &amp;quot;summertime &amp;quot; flavors such as St Germaine, lime and perirere water with cuccumbers as a garnish! Yummy!!!&lt;/span&gt; Thank you paul..hits the spot on a warm sunny day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the prefix menu selections here: &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gargoylesrestaurant.com/old%20site/test%20site/restaurant_week_.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>ask for Lauren, cell 617-233-5927</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269373081000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267567203000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>LUNCH SPECIAL@ GARGOYLES (Davis)</name><id>12761167</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269195300000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/12761167/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/7/global_13429591.jpeg</photo_url></item>
