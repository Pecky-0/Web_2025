There is a lesson for everyone to get to know each other and how to swing dance.  This is great fun for any level of experience.  Below is a note from the DJ of the Swing dance and also to let you all know there will be Kayaoke in the other hall.  Soooo if Swing scares you there will be other music and free dance or you can go next door and try a hand at kayaoke.  Either way the evening will be fun!!   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Don Hart. I was a DJ in the Worcester, Fitchburg, Gardner area 10 years ago. Some of you may remember me as Dr. D and some of you may remember me as Big Daddy. I was one of the areas first swing DJs. I have recently partnered with Ozzie to form Dance Worcester. I have music from the 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and well, you get the picture. You can swing dance to old and new Big Band, Jump Blues, Rock and Roll, etc. You can also free dance to all of that music if you want to. I will be playing fast and slow songs(for you slow dance fans) and some songs are suitable for Cha-Cha and Fox Trot as well so come and enjoy the music and dance any way you want to if the music moves you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet Up tables</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1249342979000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1246327052000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Swing Dance w/ 1 hour lesson to start</name><id>10765795</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249169400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/10765795/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/8/4/global_7250436.jpeg</photo_url></item>
