<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Greetings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current forecast is for the weather to be less-than ideal for Sunday, so we may have to be a bit flexible with our plans.  Also, a few have expressed concerns about meeting prior, so here goes…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is raining as currently predicted, members are welcome to attend this event as they wish, however I will not be attending. Chances are I will be spending plenty of time outside in the rain this weekend and feel I could better serve preparing for Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the weather changes (it is New England) then I will meet everyone in the Parking lot of America Stonehenge at 1:15 PM. The ceremony starts at 2 and they request you show up by 1:30 to make the trek up the hill to the meeting place. Bring flowers and a picnic lunch/snacks if you wish. Admission is $10 which doesn’t sound like much but could be a hardship in these times, so if you need assistance with that or are able to offer assistance to others let me know privately in an email. I would hate to see anyone miss this over financial concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way our Circle will take place as scheduled, 7PM (Goddess willing!) at the UUCH. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions email me and I will try to respond when I get back Sat or Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details on AS are at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stonehengeusa.com/VisitUs07.htm" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stonehenge...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stonehengeusa.com/summer_solstice_celebration_june%202009.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.stonehenge...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>around back</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rick</member_name><member_id>44171</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246834914000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Acolytes</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NorthShoreWitchesMeetup</urlname><id>1323749</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>The North Shore Witches Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237304833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Class &amp; Open Circle - MidSummer</name><id>9972963</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1245625200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NorthShoreWitchesMeetup/events/9972963/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/6/1/global_6369681.jpeg</photo_url></item>
