Father Peter is a priest and Master Teacher in the Mystical Christian tradition. The final seminar that will be presented Saturday is entitled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transformation: Creating the Life  You Want&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have heard of the Power of Positive Thinking and of the Law of Attraction. Did you know that there is a spiritual reality underlying these things? Jesus said, &amp;quot;It is God's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom,&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;God satisfies the desire of every living thing.&amp;quot; The action of transformation occurs when something larger than you and your understanding helps you attain what you want. If you really want something, you can have it. All religions have described this Universal Law and Truth. If something is not the way you want it to be, you can learn to change it to what you do want. Transformation is possible for everyone. This seminar will introduce you to the spiritual keys for unlocking your own powerful potential. &lt;br /&gt;A light lunch is provided during this seminar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are invited to come experience an evening or a whole weekend of life-changing teaching in the setting of a peaceful and inviting spiritual center amongst the warm and vibrant people of the Center of Light community. You are welcome to come to a single event, and if you find yourself feeling at home, be welcome to come to many more. For these seminars, if you are new to us, we extend to you a special offer to bring a friend for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;About the presenter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Peter Bowes is the co-director of a mystical order and travels weekly year round, teaching students on the spiritual path, lecturing, and performing his music.
