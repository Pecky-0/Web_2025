This is will be a self help bathing session, so we'll do the washing and cleaning and nail cutting, you do the drying and brushing. The rate will be $20.00 per dog, and it should be a fun time to have the group involved in the process! We'll need to know how many pugs will be participating, so if you could just shoot an e-mail to louwhitney@doggieday.com, we'll be able to plan accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DoggieDay Playcenter is located at 400 Tremont Street at the intersection of Arlington in the South End. Limited parking is available behind the building and there is usually ample street parking as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of all members, please make sure that your pug has a rabies tag or you carry proof of vaccination with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added feature, we will have additional groomers and bathers available from 10-2 offering a reduced rate for all of our puggies to get their nails done, their ears cleaned and a bath.
