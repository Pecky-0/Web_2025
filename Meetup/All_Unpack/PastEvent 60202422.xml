<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Will start at Congress Tavern around 9:30. Those of us having dinner at Waterman Grill may be on time or slightly late. Then head over to the Salon targeting 10:30/11. Heard from DJ JR that he's switching things up and spinning the 3rd Saturday at the Salon instead of 121. At any point, some of us may venture over to Local 121 where DJ Ty Jesso spins SOUL POWER in the basement, and a change of normal schedule it's "Disco Sour" with DJ Nick DeParis (who is great) is upstairs. Local 121 crowd has an ebb &amp;amp; flow, sometimes packed and annoying but patience you can really enjoy yourself... Feel free to break out from the group and head somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting downtown earlier is better for parking.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Val</member_name><member_id>7362863</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1335062405000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334187859000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Saturday night / downtown</name><id>60202422</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1335058200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/60202422/</event_url></item>
