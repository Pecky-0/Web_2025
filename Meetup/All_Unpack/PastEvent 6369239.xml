Many thanks to Karen and Pam, who both volunteered to organize this one (I'll be away).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of 10/22, the Meetup is full -- but if you got &amp;quot;closed out,&amp;quot; keep checking back here. Members' plans ALWAYS change and there's an excellent chance that a slot will open up closer to the date. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the same lines: If you've RSVP'd yes and later need to cancel, no problem -- but please change your RSVP as soon as you can, right up to the day of the event. That way, some other lucky soul can attend in your place. (Please use the RSVP function here rather than e-mailing the organizer or anybody else; that way, everybody knows who's coming and how many spaces are available. Thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIMING: The event will run from about 10 and go until 5 or 6 (and probably can go until the store closes, if people want to stay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: (from our previous meeting): &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://artisttradingcards.meetup.com/162/messages/boards/view/viewthread?thread=3511757"&gt;http://artisttradingc...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT TO BRING: Newcomers, need to know what to bring? There's a checklist in the Web site's &amp;quot;Files&amp;quot; section (access it from the left-hand navigation bar). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST: The total room cost for the entire day is $30, to be divided among those who attend. Someone will need to pass the hat and pay for the room. It's no biggie -- you just ask somebody at Michaels who to pay; they ring it up like any other purchase. Last time, they gave us coupons for use on merchandise that day, but if they don't, remember that they usually accept competitors' coupons, too.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD NEWS: Don't collect anything for the Web site this time; I've gotten a couple of generous donations that pretty much cover the cost for this quarter. I'll start panhandling again for 2008--but I'm set for the rest of 2007. Thanks to all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anne</member_name><member_id>2718718</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1227059304000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>ATC &amp; Altered Art Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ne-atcs</urlname><id>236124</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.3499984741</group_lon><name>New England Artist Trading Cards Plus (ATCs+) Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189955989000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>November ATC+ Meetup -- RSVP and Mark Your Calendars!</name><id>6369239</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1195311600000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ne-atcs/events/6369239/</event_url></item>
