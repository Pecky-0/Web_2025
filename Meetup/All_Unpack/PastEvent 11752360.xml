This event is being hosted by Young Americans for Liberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Woods will give a lecture at the Memorial Union Building, Theatre II on the economic crisis, its causes, and the cure. He will explain the relative roles of government, the Federal Reserve, and the free market in the development of this crisis. This will not be the analysis you've heard before, in fact, it will be the analysis the mainstream media doesn't want you to hear! If you'd like to know the real underlying problems in our economy, you can't afford to miss this lecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event is FREE and open to the public, so be sure to invite all your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information visit &lt;a href="http://www.yaliberty.org/events/2009-10-16/tom-woods-to-speak-at-unh" target="_blank"&gt;Young Americans for Liberty website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Brent</member_name><member_id>5128580</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1257719571000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256943189000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tom Woods to Speak @ UNH</name><id>11752360</id><headcount>100</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1257546600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/11752360/</event_url></item>
