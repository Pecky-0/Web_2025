We will meet at the MSSF Headquarters parking lot, take a few minutes for the EMS staff to give us some snowshoeing pointers and then we'll head out along the East Head Reservoir Trail. The clinic is limited to 15, however, if we have greater interest, we might be able to expand the clinic a bit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To provide you the right snowshoes, EMS needs to know if you are male or female and how much you weigh (kept confidential). Of course, you are welcome to bring your own snow shoes. Dress for the snow and the cold but expect to warm up! We'll try to make it around the Reservoir ~ 3.4 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lack-of-snow date TBA.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Come to the Interpreters' Center at the MSSF Headquarters parking lot.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sharl</member_name><member_id>712534</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1295916817000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>8</count></rating><group><who>Friends of Myles Standish Forest</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>friendsofmylesstandishstateforest</urlname><id>1370268</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-70.7399978638</group_lon><name>Friends of Myles Standish State Forest Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290018485000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>EMS Shops at 5 Snowshoe Clinic and Walk</name><id>15478638</id><headcount>18</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1295704800000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/friendsofmylesstandishstateforest/events/15478638/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/1/global_12380849.jpeg</photo_url></item>
