Dylan's is a small hometown restaurant in downtown Andover.  The food is very reasonable and delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be meeting at Dylan's at 7pm to have a nice dinner and conversation.  We will then go over to Palmer's which is right around the corner for some dancing to the great sounds of The River City Band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan's is located at 18 Park STreet in downtown Andover.  The following is the link to their menu:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dylansbarandgrill.com/menu.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dylansbara...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you can join us for dinner or not, please join us at Palmer's Tavern to listen to the music and do some dancing.  Palmers has a very small dance floor and it can get crowded, if this is something you do not like, this event may not be for you.  But if that does not concern you, come on down and join us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you RSVP for this event, please comment on whether you will be going to dinner with us.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At Dylan's we will meet at the outside patio, At Palmers look for the meetup table.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Donna </member_name><member_id>2153112</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254697880000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Singles, friends, newly single</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Connections-and-Friends</urlname><id>1381795</id><group_lat>42.6800003052</group_lat><group_lon>-70.8499984741</group_lon><name>Connections and Friends</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251335843000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Dinner at Dylan's and Dancing at Palmers</name><id>11211454</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1254524400000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Connections-and-Friends/events/11211454/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/6/global_10407110.jpeg</photo_url></item>
