The game this year will also be televised on ESPN2 so we are hoping for a High Def coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usual $20 donation to the Demons Nationals Campaign gets you in the door which includes a free meat pie, beer and a coopers beer stubbie holder (coosie) or hat and get in early as there is limited seating at the bar, standing room a plenty but as there is a ton of TVs around the bar viewing will be plentiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usual giveaways and raffle will be happening with some pretty cool prizes to be had including Celtics Tix (great seats) Aussie food and wine hamper and other fun stuff along with the electrifying atmosphere of that last day in September!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Damo</member_name><member_id>4884584</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1254443712000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250027559000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>AFL Grand Final Party</name><id>11089266</id><headcount>21</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1253989800000</time><rsvp_limit>120</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/11089266/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/f/global_10154047.jpeg</photo_url></item>
