Join RonPaulHQ for a banner-making party, and bring the Ron Paul Revolution home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll bring the supplies, you bring the labor.  Weather willing, we'll have the great combination of barbeque, beer, and spray paint--resulting in banners that we'll use to adorn New Hampshire *and* show support for Dr. Paul at the New Hampshire debate on June 5th.  (See that date on our calendar for details.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if the logistics work, we'll also be raising what I can only describe as a billboard at the host's house, giving folks on Rt. 28 something to look at on their way to work.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I know Kevin's house is in Pembroke; Meetup just *thinks* it's in Suncook.  Luckily, they both map the same way.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179335694000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul 2012 Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ronpaul-6</urlname><id>455674</id><group_lat>43.2400016785</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire Ron Paul 2012 Headquarters</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177942090000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sign-making and -raising party!</name><id>5724583</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1178983800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-6/events/5724583/</event_url></item>
