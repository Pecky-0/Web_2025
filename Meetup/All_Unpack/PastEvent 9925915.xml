Come sign-up for Worldwide D&amp;amp;D Game Day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come play a session of 4th Edition D&amp;amp;D. The adventure will be a chance to try out the new races and classes from Players Handbook II. There are limited spots for gaming, so please sign-up in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can sign-up as a player at at &lt;a href="http://www.warhorn.net/PandemoniumWorldwide/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.warhorn.ne...&lt;/a&gt;  If there are no slots available when you check, check back, as more splots may open as more people volunteer to be Dungeon Masters. If you want to be a DM, you can do that through Warhorn as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that RSVPing here does not sign you up for a slot. Please follow the link for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see folks there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Andy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some more details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Dark Night in Weeping Briar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by Greg Marks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fierce nighttime storm drives you to the lonely farming community of Weeping Briar in search of shelter, but the town is suspiciously empty.
