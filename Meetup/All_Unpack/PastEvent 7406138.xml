Anyone up for Texas Hold'em? or Rook? or Phase Ten? I'll have plenty of food and dessert and sweet tea on hand, but it will be BYOB if you want that...just let me know so I can prepare a cooler to chill them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble finding the house, just holler at me. I'll email the address and my telephone to those RSVP'ing as &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; a week before the dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon,&lt;br /&gt;Cindy&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the one answering the door. :-)</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1205273147000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><why>Because your Mama doesn't live here and you need some "real" conversation.
