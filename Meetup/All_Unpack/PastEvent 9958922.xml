She loves coffee as much as I do and we both loved the coffee here!!  We both took as sip and looked at each other and said &amp;quot;this coffee is FN great coffee!&amp;quot; They must put crack into it or something :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressed-tin ceilings and marble-topped tables for the style-conscious North Enders, who stop in for pick-me-ups. There's also a good dessert menu, featuring the city's best gelati and staples ranging from cannoli to tiramisu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about taking a walk around the North End, Govt Ctr, Beacon Hill areas and grabbing a cup or two of incredible coffee? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're in let me know. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Bring your camera. It's a good way to get some great shots of the city's different neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Need to RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241551318000</updated><rating><average>4.46999979019</average><count>15</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>29</yes_rsvp_count><created>1237137353000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Best Coffee in City - Walk the North End, Waterfront, Beacon Hill &amp; Great Coffee</name><id>9958922</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1241287200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/9958922/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/a/5/global_7681189.jpeg</photo_url></item>
