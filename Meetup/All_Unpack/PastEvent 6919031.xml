Even as early as the 1870s the Museum received such gifts as Thomas Crawford's marble portrait of Charles Sumner and a Tiffany silver pitcher purchased at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. American silver continued to find its way into the Museum's collection through the first major exhibitions of such objects, held in 1906 and 1911. By the early 1900s, the Museum had acquired an important collection of paintings. In 1928 a series of American period rooms was installed with the addition of a decorative arts wing. The gift of the M. and M. Karolik Collection of Eighteenth-Century American Arts in 1939 established the MFA as a major repository of colonial and federal furniture, paintings, silver, and other objects from urban centers. The second major gift of the Karoliks, in 1947, of American paintings created between 1815 and 1865, brought great strength in the Hudson River school, American genre painting, and American folk painting.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Steve Gluck</member_name><member_id>2864884</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215313881000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Citizens of the World</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Cambridge-Moveable-Feast</urlname><id>370532</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Cambridge Moveable Feast</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1197766116000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Art of the Americas &amp; Cocktails at MFA</name><id>6919031</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1199487600000</time><rsvp_limit>24</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Moveable-Feast/events/6919031/</event_url></item>
