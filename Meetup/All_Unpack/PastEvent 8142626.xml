<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Weather.com says there will be &amp;quot;a few showers&amp;quot; from 10 - 12 tomorrow.  I know it's a bit subjective, but if it's drizzling at 9:30 am, I will leave my house to go to the park.  I'll be bringing my umbrella!  If by chance it's pouring, I will consider this meetup cancelled and I will post that info right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other Meetup Groups has doggie meetups at Bradley Palmer State Park and they give it good reviews, so let's give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet inside the main entrance parking lot at 10 a.m. Please be on time; we'll wait about 10 minutes for everyone who RSVP'd &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;, then get started on our walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: purple"&gt;***** Please bring plenty of pooper-scooper bags to pick up after your dog. *****&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;-laura&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Laura</member_name><member_id>790021</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1215439746000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Cavalier King Chas Spnl Lovers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CavalierLoversofMA</urlname><id>510192</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9700012207</group_lon><name>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Lovers of MA</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1213467140000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>North Shore Cavalier King Charles Spaniel July Meetup</name><id>8142626</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1215266400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CavalierLoversofMA/events/8142626/</event_url></item>
