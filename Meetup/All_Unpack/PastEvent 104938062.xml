&lt;p&gt;This event is open to all, especially those who hate Mondays and especially for those who want to check out the different bar scenes in Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's location is: Pizzico on Hope Street!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pizzico has been an institution on Hope Street in the Summit neighborhood of the East Side for a long time. Its upscale in a neighborhood way and the food is delicious! I checked it out the other day as I was doing MNM recon and was so pleased to see that they've renovated beautifully and have a wonderful, large bar area in the back complete with a cozy section with bistro tables and some high bench seating! It looks great! As a place to go for a terrific meal or just for a drink and apps, I think you'll like this one. Its a great spot, so let's check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come early, come late, leave early, stay late, everyone is always welcome...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing ever cancels Monday Happy Hours. Except Hurricane Sandy and NYE 2012. &lt;br /&gt;

 Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be wearing a scarf or black cap in the picture, but we're not hard to find!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>R.
