 &lt;br /&gt;

 It's graphic novel month and from the results of the poll, you want to read Transmetropolitan, Volumes 1 and 2 by Warren Ellis (Author) and Darick Robertson (Illustrator)!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Amazon, Volume 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this first volume, Spider ventures into the dangerous Angels 8 district, home of the Transients — humans who have decided to become aliens through cosmetic surgery. But Spider's interview with the Transients' leader gets him a scoop he didn't bargain for. And don't miss Spider's first confrontation with the President of the United States . . . in a men's room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Amazon, Volume 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this volume, Jerusalem targets three of society's most worshiped and warped pillars: politics, religion, and television. When Spider tries to shed light on the atrocities of these institutions, he finds himself fleeing a group of hit men/kidnappers in possession of his ex-wife's frozen head, a distorted creature alleging to be his son, and a vicious talking police dog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting at Comicazi on Highland Ave in Davis Square. There is metered parking all along Highland as well as a public lot on Day Street near Redbones and across the street from Orleans restaurant. There is also T access and bus connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Josh&lt;/p&gt;
