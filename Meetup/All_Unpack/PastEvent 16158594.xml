A movie from the PBS "Independent Lens" series, it is based on Barry Werth's book "The Scarlet Professor / Newton Arvin: A Literary Life Shattered By Scandal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Labor Day weekend in 1960, Massachusetts state police troopers swept through the small, idyllic town of Northampton and hauled 15 men off to jail. Three of them were professors at Northampton&amp;rsquo;s elite Smith College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE GREAT PINK SCARE tells the story of the devastating persecution that followed, when the three Smith professors were charged with possessing and dispersing obscene literature, tried in Northampton District Court, and eventually convicted as felons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, it was the routing out of pornographers, but in reality, it was a McCarthy-like witch-hunt against homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;
