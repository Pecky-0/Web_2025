They have public guided tours on weekends running each 45 minutes. The guided tour of the production facilities ends with a wine tasting of three of their wines. There is also a restaurant which is open for lunch on Saturdays (11:30-2:00) and dinner (5:30-9:00). You are welcomed to walk through their orchard and gardens (which include apples, peaches, etc...). Visit their website for directions and details. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nashobawinery.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nashobawin...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small fee of $3 for the guided tour which includes a complimentary Wine Glass and the wine tasting. The tours start at 11am and the last one starts at 4pm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see a big group at this event!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will get together between 3:00 and 4:00 outside of the Store and Restaurant entrance (when you arrive go down the hill) and take the 4pm tour which will end at 5pm including time to shop at their store. Those who want to go for dinner at J's can wait until 5:30. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1186098354000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Europhiles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>euro-76</urlname><id>467296</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Euro Social Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1184244753000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winery Tour &amp; Wine Tasting - Nashoba Valley</name><id>6012706</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1185649200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/euro-76/events/6012706/</event_url></item>
