These two great gentlemen are dedicated to a proposition which was true in my time, just as it's true today. Be excellent to each other. And... PARTY ON, DUDES!&amp;quot; - Abe Lincoln&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's face it, Keanu Reeves is a prophet, philosopher, and teacher whose work constantly attempts to free our minds and better our lives. Example numero uno: This 1989 classic about two dudes, Ted &amp;quot;Theodore&amp;quot; Logan (Reeves) and Bill S. Preston, Esq. (Alex Winters), who seem to be complete idiots but are, in fact, the future of rock 'n' roll and the founders of a utopian society. Before they can fulfill this destiny though they need to not fail history &amp;quot;most heinously.&amp;quot; So with a little help from future dude Rufus (a most excellent George Carlin) and a time-traveling phone booth, the pair embark on a mission to collect some of the world's most esteemed historical figures for their history presentation. In the words, er, word of the man himself: Whoa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While just watching BILL &amp;amp; TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE is already most non-heinous, having free reign to yell out our favorite lines along with a group of other time-traveling slacker-obsessed fans sounds like a great way to be excellent to each other and party on, dudes. And, even though Halloween will be over by the time we get to this show, here's your chance to get extra miles out of your costume (or a reason to put together a new one): Our pre-show Famous People Through Time costume contest. Now we just need to find an old-school telephone booth that we can all squeeze into...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presented by the Action Pack, the folks who brought you the The Princess Bride and Army of Darkness quote-alongs, the Michael Jackson Sing-Along, and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Here: &lt;a href="https://www.readyticket.net/webticket/webticket2.asp?WCI=BuyTicket&amp;amp;WCE=BILL+AND+TEDS+EXCELLENT+A,111420092355,2,130," target="_blank"&gt;Coolidge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly encourage you to buy early. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be at Star Wars in Concert earlier in the evening, so look for a &amp;quot;Han Shot First&amp;quot; shirt and a giddy inner child. Hopefully the weather will cooperate as the Coolidge lines people up outside.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KateMcQ</member_name><member_id>6532193</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258433472000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NerdFunBoston</urlname><id>661701</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Nerd Fun - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257833840000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure Quote-Along</name><id>11839693</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258260300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NerdFunBoston/events/11839693/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/f/f/global_11746607.jpeg</photo_url></item>
