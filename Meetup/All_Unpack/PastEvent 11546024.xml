These Movie Meetups will take place each month on the third Sunday.  The first Movie Meetup for 2010 will be Sunday, January 17th.  We will meet for brunch before the movie at &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Joe's American Bar and Grill in Dedham&lt;/span&gt; and then take in a matinee across the street at the new &lt;span style="color: blue"&gt;Showcase Cinema de Lux at Legacy Place in Dedham&lt;/span&gt;. There are so many good movies showing right now, there will be several to choose from.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe's in Dedham is conveniently located on Route 1, directly off Route 128; it is exit 15A going north and exit 15B going south. Joe's is a local staple for fresh American cuisine in a comfortable atmosphere. Their brunch menu starts at $10.99.  Our group will be offered a &lt;b&gt;complimentary cocktail&lt;/b&gt; (Bloody Mary, Screwdriver, Mimosa, Champagne or Bud Light draft) when selecting an entree from the brunch menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brunch we will head across the street to the new Showcase Cinema de Lux.  Currently, the following movies are showing between noon and 3:10.  You may either eat fast and see an early movie or shop for a while in the new Legacy Place and take in a later show.  We do not all have to see the same movie unless we want to.  Feel free to branch out on your own if you so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avatar 3D&lt;br /&gt;The Blind Side&lt;br /&gt;New Moon&lt;br /&gt;It's Compilcated&lt;br /&gt;Up in the Air&lt;br /&gt;Invictus&lt;br /&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;br /&gt;Daybreak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for the first Sunday Afternoon at the Movies of the new year!  &lt;u&gt;South Shore Baby Boomers...we would love to see you, too!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be in the bar with a Meetup sign</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mindy</member_name><member_id>8014085</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1265323958000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254694550000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Afternoon at the Movies</name><id>11546024</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263744000000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/11546024/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/9/global_11148425.jpeg</photo_url></item>
