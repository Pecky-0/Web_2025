Monadnock can't match the oxygen depleted altitude of the Andes but heck, a little tune up on the legs can't hurt? I know it's been done a few times this year but just putting it out there if anyone feels like joining me. I'll be starting early, 8:30am as I have a busy afternoon...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 8:30pm 05/25 - I just had to cancel myself...  My afternoon plans were moved up and I don't have enough time to get out there, hike and get back... I left this open as Earl and Tom are going...  Sorry about that!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1338065953000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>kindred spirits</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Northern-central-MA-Hiking-Group</urlname><id>1282371</id><group_lat>42.5299987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.75</group_lon><name>Northern Central MA, Southern NH Hiking Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1337906711000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Last Minute...
