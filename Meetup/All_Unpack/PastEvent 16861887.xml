<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a Thursday, but I feel a need to get in one more hike before the end of Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet at the AMC Highland Center, unless by some miracle the Mt Clinton Rd parking area is plowed (it wasn't last time I was there on Feb 27th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route is Crawford Path to Mt Pierce, then on to Eisenhower, returning to Pierce and the trailhead. We'll decide whether we go to the Pierce summit on the way up or back (or both) while we're hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is winter. You need to be prepared. The ridge is quite exposed and weather can be brutal and unpredictable. Particularly nasty weather will cancel, since the reason I want to do this so soon after doing Pierce is so I can get some views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I serve as social director, not guide or outfitter. The normal website disclaimer applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to hit the trailhead early AM, I'm planning to stay overnight Wednesday at the Highland Center, probably the Shapleigh Bunkhouse, because it's cheap ($39 for Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast).&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>JCarter</member_name><member_id>11575712</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300453675000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Because we can.
