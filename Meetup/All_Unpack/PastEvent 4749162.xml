Their name inspires fear even among battle-hardened mercenaries, and their dark forest is avoided by even the most foolhardy of adventurers. So why are you venturing into their realm, and what will you find when you get there? Come find out October 23rd.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a one-shot D&amp;amp;D 3.5 adventure set in my own campaign world. It's the same adventure I'm running August 28th, just rerun for those who can't make this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's open to 8 players. New players welcome! Characters and minis will be provided. Bring your own dice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More in-depth backstory can be found at the link below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two cats and a big friendly rottweiler that *will* try to climb in your lap. Those who are alergic to animals (or just don't like 'em) be warned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://davidgrenier.com/nerdstuff/solsticemoon/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidgrenier.com/nerdstuff/solsticemoon/" target="_blank"&gt;http://davidgrenier.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>John</member_name><member_id>2295622</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1124053920000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D One-shot: Under the Solstice Moon (redux)</name><id>4749162</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1130083200000</time><rsvp_limit>9</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/4749162/</event_url></item>
