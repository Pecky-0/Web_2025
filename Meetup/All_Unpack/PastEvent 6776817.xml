We will discuss potential trips and possible dates.  Also please feel free to bring in some examples of your work to share with the group. We will be looking to set up our first trip for sometime this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to think of a location, the type of shot we are looking for, the cost of the trip, and supplies/and or equipment needed for the shoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to break it down by season.  Some of the events I would like to see are a Windjammer weekend, Hike to a Mountain summit and early morning or sunset shoot, white water shoot(with some waterproof disposals of course)...  And to just get out there and explore and find that perfect shot...&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1198523275000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Photographers, Models &amp; MUA</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonportraitphotographers</urlname><id>830833</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Boston Portrait Photographers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1195578737000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>First Meetup for NE X-treme</name><id>6776817</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1198350000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonportraitphotographers/events/6776817/</event_url></item>
