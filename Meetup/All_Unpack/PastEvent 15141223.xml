Your drive here may take a little longer than usual though, especially if you need to drive through downtown to get to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you have a favorite game please bring it; otherwise, you know we're well stocked. You are also welcome to bring a favorite snack for the evening. We'll have plenty to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have never attended a traditional game night, we usually split up in different rooms or areas to play smaller games of players' choice and then come together for a larger game or two at the end of the night. However, sometimes we just play large party games for the majority of the evening. It depends on the mood of the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats (one of whom was recently named the Official Cat of Salem!), but they will be locked up for the evening. The house is also home to a hopefully well-behaved 2 year old, who will obviously not be locked up for the evening, but she will be in bed after the first hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Members who have been a &amp;quot;no-show&amp;quot; will not be permitted to RSVP for this event.  Also, should you change your RSVP at the last minute for the event, be warned that you may be counted as a &amp;quot;no-show.&amp;quot;  You may review our attendance policy on the group website.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1287976436000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1287362389000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Traditional Game Night</name><id>15141223</id><headcount>11</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1287876600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/15141223/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/1/global_11205793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
