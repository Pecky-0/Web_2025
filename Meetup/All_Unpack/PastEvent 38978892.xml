Very easy outreach. 15 minutes after services have started arrive at the church, hit each car in the lot with one of Carla's great Faith cards or the flyers HQ made up. Leave and hit the next church on the list. We're had positive feedback from people already. After this event, food and spirits. Info to follow. At 2:00 p.m., sign wave on South Willow Street. Event to be created shortly.
