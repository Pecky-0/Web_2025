Our group has been invited to attend the store to promote the group, only 8 groups get invited! I will be attending most of the two days at a table. I'm looking for any volunteers that would like to help out at the table? Looking for help Fri 13th from 4-8pm and Sat. 14th 10am -12pm. If you can't help at the table, but are looking for some new gear, drop in and get your discount!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kellie Barr-Foster</member_name><member_id>6992283</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334331018000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Rock Climbers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>rockclimbing-134</urlname><id>1120342</id><group_lat>43.2099990845</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0299987793</group_lon><name>The NH Rock Climbing Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1333372283000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Club Day at Eastern Mountain Sports</name><id>58884162</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334325600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rockclimbing-134/events/58884162/</event_url></item>
