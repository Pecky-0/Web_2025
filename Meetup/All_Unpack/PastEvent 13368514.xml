They ask that we call for a reservation if we are over 10+, which I have. Also, since we are NOT chartering the boat, they seat us on a first come, first serve basis even if we have a reservation.  See you soon!! ******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;** ATTENTION everyone!!! Please note that because the RSVP count is high (yaaay!), I am going to split up the group into two boats - 12:00 boat &amp;amp; 12:15 boat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am requesting that some of you come by 11:45am to take the first boat. Any questions - email me!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color: crimson"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where: Branford, CT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 12:15pm...meet by noon &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost: $10 (adults). Please note there are discount rates available for seniors &amp;amp; kids :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a 45-min boat ride to tour the pretty Thimble Islands. There are different touring companies. I like Sea Mist best - it's a double decker, has a bathroom &amp;amp; you can have a beer or two on board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info on Sea Mist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thimbleislandcruise.com/tours.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thimbleisl...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, since tour boats leave every hour, you don't have to necessarily take the noon time tour with me. If you want to go earlier or later that's fine too...Also, as it gets closer to the date, I will schedule a rain date as well as include my contact info :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Selam&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Selam</member_name><member_id>7067675</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1277086068000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>40</yes_rsvp_count><created>1272905329000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thimble Islands Boat Tour </name><id>13368514</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1276962300000</time><rsvp_limit>60</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/13368514/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/4/a/global_351658.jpeg</photo_url></item>
