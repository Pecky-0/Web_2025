<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Whether you're planning on going to the ICA beforehand or not, head  to &lt;a href="http://www.luckyslounge.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Lucky's Lounge&lt;/a&gt; for dinner and live music. Lucky's has a speakeasy, Swingers, hip vibe. It's so incognito, they don't even have a sign. Just show up at the address and tell them Bret Lazer sent you. You'll be asked to play a few bars of a specific Sinatra tune on mouth trumpet and if you fail -- just kidding. It's the basement-level place on the corner with a brick facade, and red lights in the windows, but, seriously, there is no sign. I can tell you that the comfort food menu offers many tasty options and the music is usually pretty tight. Come see for yourself, that is, if you can find the joint. (Now I'm just messing with you.) Don't worry. I'll give out my digits in advance and you can text/call if you get lost -- the Rat Pack members are rolling over in their graves.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Nick</member_name><member_id>8504559</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1263690587000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258233308000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Get Lucky, Eat, and Groove</name><id>11874979</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1263517200000</time><rsvp_limit>18</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Brunch-Lovers-Wanted/events/11874979/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/0/1/global_11800353.jpeg</photo_url></item>
