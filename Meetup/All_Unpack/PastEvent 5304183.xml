I  want to tell you about these events I thought you would like to know about. There is a wonderful Seminar happening that will really enhance your relationship with God. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will take an in-depth look at the inner meaning of Christmas, and how we can enter into the experience of a truly spiritual Holy Season. Mystics interpret all the events in the life of Jesus and Mary as not only being literal events, but also symbolizing each step along the spiritual path for those who desire transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Christmas story, not only do Jesus and Mary symbolize specific aspects of us, so do Joseph, the wise men, the shepherds, the star, the animals in the stable, and the stable itself. The format will be an open discussion, questions and answers. All are welcome to attend and join. This is not a holiday or special season as the world sees it, but a real spiritual time to open to the Light that will be born within during this Season. The Light that all inner paths recognize as truth, wisdom, and the way to Union with the Divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seminar: The Inner Meaning of Christmas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date: Sat., December 9th, 10-2pm &lt;br /&gt;A perspective of the Christmas story that looks at &lt;br /&gt;the birth of the Christ, the wise men, the star, and &lt;br /&gt;the shepherd as events and parts of ourselves.
