Where most people would retire he didn’t, he still buys and sells real estate today in this market using those same systems. He is one of the leading experts on Automating your Real Estate Business and Virtual investing. He invests in 6 different markets across the U.S. using his virtual investing strategies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He coaches students all over the United States for over four years, including some of the biggest name real estate investors in the market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack Childress has a widely diverse business background. He is a highly successful Real Estate Investor &amp;amp; Business Developer. Zack has an Investment company which has been successfully operating for over 6 years, a funding company for over 3 years, and a wholesaling business for over 6 years. He is always finding new ways to automate his business to maximize his returns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack spent the last 6 years of his full-time investing career creating automated virtual investing systems that would give him and his wife back their time. Now their real estate investing companies can run on their own. And they now have the freedom to do whatever they want, whenever they want. He took all the education he learned over the past 14 years and brought it into the 21st century by fully automating his businesses.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack made investing in Real Estate so easy that now anyone can invest from anywhere they have a computer and phone. He knew he had to be focused on marketing and getting as many leads as possible coming through his systems. Therefore, he could keep the deals he wants to buy and wholesale the rest to other investors. So, Zack’s main investing technique is wholesaling for quick cash so he can take that cash and invest in Commercial Real Estate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monthly Meeting&lt;br /&gt;5:30 - 6:15 PM - Power Hour - Networking &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6:30 PM - Meeting &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Location: Best Western Hotel, 380 Winter St, Waltham, Ma &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free to members, Visitors only $25 at the door.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dianne Shvanda</member_name><member_id>7024028</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264289586000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Investors</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>investing-376</urlname><id>551165</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Area Real Estate Investors Association</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1259862214000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>1/21 Boston AREIA meeting  - "Mr. Automation"</name><id>12009679</id><headcount>108</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264116600000</time><rsvp_limit>100</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/investing-376/events/12009679/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/4/b/global_1787963.jpeg</photo_url></item>
