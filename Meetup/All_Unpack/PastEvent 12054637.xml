They may be in charge now, but old habits die hard. Players will take up foam swords and engage each other in battle- but be careful, the imperials have ways of dealing with those who don’t behave themselves! This 2 hour event is intended for ages 6 to adult. Bring your very best manners, and then get ready to throw them away when the imperials aren’t looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre Reg: $15/members and friends $25/nonmembers&lt;br /&gt;At Door: $25/members and friends $35/nonmembers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiver Required for all non-members&lt;br /&gt;Contact Us to Pre-Register&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1264378068000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Sword Fighters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners</urlname><id>1313138</id><group_lat>42.5099983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1999969482</group_lon><name>Swordsmanship and Fencing for Beginners</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1260398921000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Buddy Night: Civilized Company</name><id>12054637</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1264204800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Swordsmanship-and-Fencing-for-Beginners/events/12054637/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/6/global_6162838.jpeg</photo_url></item>
