We're getting together at The Blue Oar in Haddam for good company and food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Oar is a gem on the CT river. Great waterviews! Gourmets... bring your own tablecloth, wine, glasses and candles. you can't ask for more. Shame it can't last year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a BYOB event...so pack up a bottle of wine or a few bottles of beer and lets break bread together once more. Just remember, The Blue Oar does not accept CC...cash only! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seafood is delicious...the desserts are awesome. So come and let's squeeze the last of summer out of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is up for it later on in the evening...we can all go somewhere to do a little dancing. Have a favorite place? Share it with us!!! Hmmmm...I think someone is having a birthday that day!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for  Terri or the Meetup Sign...</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1284347416000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cool Singles</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>www-theirassinglesevents-com</urlname><id>1411725</id><group_lat>41.9300003052</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6399993896</group_lon><name>The Ira's Singles Events, LLC.</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1283715166000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Let's All Meet @ The Blue Oar...</name><id>14665961</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1284238800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/www-theirassinglesevents-com/events/14665961/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/c/2/global_17717570.jpeg</photo_url></item>
