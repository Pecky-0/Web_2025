We'll meet at Charles River Canoe &amp;amp; Kayak in Auburndale/Newton (next to the Newton Marriott on Commonwealth Avenue), and paddle upstream to the Cordingly Dam in Wellesley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newton section of the Charles River is known as the Lakes District, an area with more than 100 years of canoeing history. The Lakes District was created when construction of the Moody Street Dam in 1814 to power cotton mills created a 200-acre "mill pond" with many lovely bays and inlets between Newton Lower Falls and Waltham. This scenic area drew thousands of boaters from Norumbega Park around the turn of the 20th century. The premier social and recreational spot of its time, Norumbega featured several boathouses, canoe rentals and two steamboats that made trips through the Lakes District in the summertime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rental center is located in a historic boathouse adjacent to the site of the former Norumbega Amusement Park and Totem Pole Ballroom.Â There is place at Norumbega Park for people bringing their own kayaks to put-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upstream of the boathouse the river is narrow, tree-lined, and passes the Leo J. Martin Golf Course. The current becomes stronger closer to Rt. 16, but you can simply turn around and ride the current back whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kayak rentals start at $17/hour for a single person kayak. Call (617) 965-5110 to reserve, although reservations are usually not necessary, even on busy weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; - The organizers in this group are NOT trained leaders or instructors. The organizers only set the time and place, each person participating in any group trip is responsible for their own safety. Each participant is responsible for evaluating all relevant conditions for the trip and determining if their skills and equipment are appropriate for those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Peter Flentov</member_name><member_id>12465893</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1344291648000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>6</count></rating><group><who>Active "People" people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>socialnetwork-1425</urlname><id>1283834</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Sitzundjibers Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1343748833000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paddle the Lakes District of the Charles River</name><id>75687602</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>10800000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1344189600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/socialnetwork-1425/events/75687602/</event_url></item>
