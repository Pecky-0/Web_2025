Yes, despite the very close votes in which 4 restaurants were all within 2 votes of each other, the Organizer Team decided to veer into Quincy near the Milton line as we have not yet been to that section of Quincy and we wanted to try a different area of the map.  The Italian/American menu looks very yummy and inexpensive with most lunch items under $11.  The prices and generous portions are very appealing to the budget and cost conscious members of the SSDOMG.  Why not join us for this event?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a great opportunity to meet and get to know each other, as well as talk about different foods, restaurants, and meals we enjoy.  This will also be a great time to plan our next Dining Out event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday Afternoon Mid-Month Lunch&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, May 15th, 2010 @ 1pm&lt;br /&gt;Villa Rosa Restaurant and Lounge&lt;br /&gt;705 Adams Street&lt;br /&gt;Quincy, MA 02169&lt;br /&gt;617-773-0095&lt;br /&gt;www.villarosaquincy.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Location: &lt;i&gt;Outside the front door if it's nice out.

Paying for all of our meals in cash has been SSDOMG'S policy for over three years. It allows us to avoid the confusion of having the waitstaff run multiple credit card slips and generally helps to keep things simpler for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inclement Weather: TBD - Please see our Weather policy on the About page (scroll to the bottom and click on &amp;quot;Weather&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;  Please see the restaurant's website for best directions for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview: Near East Milton Square off Route 93.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Meet outside the Front Door.
