We can walk the paved loop, or venture off on to the trails. There is a nice beach area, covered bridge, and a waterwheel along the way. For anyone who likes photography, the park plenty to offer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a state park, dogs are welcome but must be on a leash, unless we go &amp;quot;off road.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are large parking lots on the left and right as you enter the park. We will meet just past there, at the ranger's booth in the entrance to the park. I will post a MeetUp sign on the booth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm being optimistic in advance that we'll have nice, warm weather. However, rain cancels the event.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We will meet at the ranger's booth at the entrance to the park.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1241128829000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>BBW/BHM and their Admirers.</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BigAttractions</urlname><id>667139</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>Big Attractions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1239482600000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday Afternoon Stroll</name><id>10165850</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240171200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BigAttractions/events/10165850/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/5/global_8102245.jpeg</photo_url></item>
