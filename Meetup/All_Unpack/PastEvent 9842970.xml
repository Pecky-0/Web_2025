John will be singing classic big band tunes as performed by Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, and Harry Connick Jr.  As a 16-year-old, John finished sixth in the third season of American Idol and is now completing his final year at Berklee before resuming his recording career!  Catch him while you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also featured at this dance is 21-year-old female vocalist Dana Lauren, who has sung in Arturo Sandoval's band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band plays from 8:30 to 11:00pm.

Today it offers dancing to live bands four times a week.  It's like stepping back in time!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Frank will be on stage conducting the band.
