So we're having an Australia day in July, on the 25th, 6 months exactly from the real Australia day. I'm organizing the event, which is going to be held at Goddard Park in East Greenwich, RI. The park is right near 95, and so is very accessible (an hour from Boston by car).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you guys could make it a meetup that would be great! I've got a little group of Aussie friends here in RI but the more Aussies that are there to celebrate the better. I was home recently and bought a cricket set so I'm thinking beers, bundy, barbie and backyard cricket, just like home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be buying a bunch of chicken, snags, steak and other &lt;br /&gt;things for a big barbie. To facilitate this I'm suggesting that &lt;br /&gt;everyone who attends bring $10 to cover the food, so I'm not &lt;br /&gt;stuck with a big bill by myself. We'll be cooking up a storm &lt;br /&gt;the day before, too... lamingtons, pav, the whole bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Goddard park is officially an alcohol free zone, as are &lt;br /&gt;most (all?) public parks in RI. I'll be buying some rum to make &lt;br /&gt;an adult punch but you can't really get away with beer &lt;br /&gt;cans/bottles in the park. I'll also have soft drink and water &lt;br /&gt;available for people to drink. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Conrad Pels</member_name><member_id>8319424</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280078929000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Larrikins</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>aussie-145</urlname><id>222356</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Aussie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279208447000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Australia Day in July - RHODE ISLAND</name><id>14111252</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280073600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/aussie-145/events/14111252/</event_url></item>
