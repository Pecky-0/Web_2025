&lt;p&gt;The Steve Cole Poker run is a fun event - $15 per serson.  They give you directions to go for a ride, with stops along the way to collect playing cards. The last stop is at the Upland Club in Plympton, where they have a band and a great chicken dinner, bike games, and other fun stuff going on.  There is a large covered pavillion to protect you from too much sun, or even any "liquid sunshine".   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to ride in a large group with strangers, either.  You get to ride with only the people you want to ride with - people go out in their own little groups on this one.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration starts at 9:30 and ends @ 11.  I plan on leaving there @ 10 - 10:15 to do the poker run.  Hope to see you there!!   &lt;/p&gt;
