Learn to free yourself from fear.&lt;br /&gt;Discover the joys of living single.&lt;br /&gt;Reclaim your feminine spiritual power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Joy of Being Single&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, January 28 • 7:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25 - Bring a Friend for Free!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is so much pressure in our culture to be in a relationship. Why are we not okay just being ourselves? Being single can be a joyful experience of freedom and flexibility. Whether for a season, for a reason, or for a lifetime, the single life can be a regenerating, rejuvenating, and relaxing alternative to relationship-ho pping. First, however, you must be happy with your own company and fulfilled with your own endeavors; otherwise, what have you to bring to a relationship should one arise? Come! Learn to relax into the state of singleness and harvest the joys that spring from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also this weekend: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fear: Why We Are Afraid and the Path to Fearlessness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, January 27 • 7:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $25 - Bring a Friend for Free!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Women, Spirit, Healing, and Power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, January 29 • 10 am to 2:30 pm&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Donation: $35 - Lunch Included - Bring a Friend for Free!&lt;br /&gt;Please note: this seminar is for WOMEN ONLY.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rev.
