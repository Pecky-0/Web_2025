<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>After suggesting to Jeff that he lead and moderate a discussion on a topic of his choosing, I am very happy that he has agreed!  He asked for my thoughts regarding a tentative topic proposal, something along the lines of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Philosophy: What's the Use?  Do we need philosophy? Is it superfluous or essential? Does it answer the big questions or is it irrelevant? Is it abstract noodling or what guides us through our lives? How can most people ignore it yet it be the basis of anyone's beliefs?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Excellent!  Philosophy is by far and away the leading discipline when it comes to asking itself the question, 'So, what is it exactly that we do?'  As you probably know, many books (I think I'm right about this) have been written with the title (both similarly and exactly), 'What is Philosophy?'  I think that the discussion could be a lot of fun.  So, feel free to write a description and I'll post it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is only a temporary posting that will be replaced by Jeff’s, unless he decides to leave it as is.  Perhaps only art comes close to philosophy in its self-reflectivity, and I find that I can become truly angst-driven when I start to think about the kind of thinking—philosophy—that I love to think about.  I think it’s a fairly common quality shared by many who engage in serious philosophizing.  I'm looking forward to the meeting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s a philosophical bio on Jeff: &lt;a href="http://www.philosophyautobiography.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;philosophyautobiography&lt;/a&gt;                  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/pages/No_Show_Policy/"&gt;No Show Policy&lt;/a&gt; (please read)&lt;br /&gt;                  &lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'm the guy in the picture.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Arthur</member_name><member_id>3026120</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268611508000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Philosophers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Philosophy-Discussions</urlname><id>1422684</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1900024414</group_lon><name>Boston Area Philosophy Discussions</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266452358000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Philosophy: What's the Use?</name><id>12632662</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1268438400000</time><rsvp_limit>25</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Discussions/events/12632662/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/8/6/global_7925510.jpeg</photo_url></item>
