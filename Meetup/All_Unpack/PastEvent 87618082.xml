&lt;p&gt;Since this event is on HALLOWEEN, I thought that it would be fun to look for some "TREATS" along the route to Salem. However, the "TRICK" is on me because while this trail was a GEOCACHING SITE, I have not been able to find the co-ordinates. Perhaps it is no longer active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with GEOCACHING, you can check it out on geocaching.com. If anyone finds the co-ordinates, bring them with you and we will play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring plenty of water and dress in layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we might not be able to find some "TREATS" on the trail, we can have some when we caravan to my place. Just bring your favorite beverage and either an appetizer or a dessert to share. Everyone wearing orange and black will get a special "TREAT."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If mother nature plays a "TRICK" and rains on us, the walk / bike ride portion of the meetup will be canceled. However, we will still celebrate Halloween at my place around 4:00. I will send my address to the members who RSVP "yes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note if you plan to walk or bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enter your "yes" RSVP's on one site even if you belong to mulitple meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
