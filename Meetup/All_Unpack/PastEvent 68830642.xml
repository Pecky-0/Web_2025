<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;According to Backpacker Magazine, this is America's second hardest day hike and the hardest one in the east.  This is a bit of an exaggeration, there are harder day hikes in New Hampshire (I have one scheduled for July 28 - see the discussion thread for a little more info).  Nonetheless, this is an extremely challenging hike.  Hikers stronger than I have been unable to complete or been hobbled before doing it.  You can find the Backpacker magazine article at  &lt;a href="http://www.backpacker.com/may_2005_feature_hardest_dayhikes/destinations/8485"&gt;http://www.backpacker.com/may_2005_feature_hardest_dayhikes/destinations/8485&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the challenging nature of the hike, we will be carefully screening hikers. Everyone who plans on going will be asked to start on the waiting list and answer some RSVP questions. It will be important to do some major hikes in the month month leading up to this.  (I posted a Presidential Traverse for early June on BHG  the AMC has two traverses listed at&lt;a href="http://activities.outdoors.org/search/index.cfm/action/details/id/61822"&gt;http://activities.outdoors.org/search/index.cfm/action/details/id/61822&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://activities.outdoors.org/search/index.cfm/action/details/id/60370"&gt;http://activities.outdoors.org/search/index.cfm/action/details/id/60370&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be cautious in committing to this trip, while we are trying to prevent some problems with our screening - your self-screening is more important.  Please do your own research on the trip to determine what the risks are for you and if the risks are worth it.  Here is one place you might want to start:  &lt;a href="http://www.davidalbeck.com/hiking/pemiloop.html"&gt;http://www.davidalbeck.com/hiking/pemiloop.html&lt;/a&gt; Consult your doctor if you think that might be at all helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiking Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemi Loop is almost 32 miles and includes over 9000 feet of cumulative elevation gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start from Lincoln Woods Trail from Lincoln Woods Visitor Center Parking lot.  Our hike goes counter-clockwise with the following mountains in this order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Bondcliff (4265 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Mt Bond (4698 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. South Twin Mtn (4902 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Mt Garfield (4500 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Mt Lafayette (5260 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Mt. Lincoln (5089 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Mt Liberty (4459 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Mt Flume (4328 ft)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also cross Little Haystack Mtn (4780 ft) which is on the Trailwrights' list, but not on the AMC list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book Time is 21 Hours 49 mins but we'd like to complete under book time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two 4K peaks nearby which are Galehead Mtn (4024 ft) &amp;amp; West Bond (4540 ft) and North Twin (4,761) is 1.3 miles away but we will not add these side trips this time (we plan on returning and doing the side trips on July 11th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the things to consider before joining us:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.   This trip is long, rugged and strenuous.  We will start in the dark and may finish in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.    We very much want to under book time for this hike.  We would like to average 2 miles an hour over the whole trip (this includes rest stops).   This means beating book time by about 25% for the trip.   If we do so, we will average about 2 mph for the day, take 16 hours and -  finish at about 7PM (assuming a 3AM start).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Since we're planning to start hiking VERY EARLY MORNING (like3 AM) we plan on staying nearby, perhaps camping.  We'll discuss details later one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  If the numbers are right, we may want to car spot in case some or all of us need to cut the hike short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  We will be hiking as a group.  Anyone who gets ahead will be expected to wait at any trail junctions and at any place where there could be confusion about the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  We'll be watching the weather carefully and may re-schedule or cancel accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #993300"&gt;David (PedXing) notes:  As meetup organizers, our primary function is social.  We are getting people together for this trip.  We are not functioning as guides or protectors.    While we attempt to plan something that will work for everyone and will try to head off the problems that we can see and anticipate, you should not come on this trip if you would not feel able to safely complete this trip on your own, or accompanied by a friend. Any attempts to increase the comfort and safety of the group should not lead you to believe that we are taking responsibility for your safety. Our underlying assumption is that if you come on this trip, you are a responsible adult who will use good judgement and that you have the skills and ability complete this hike safely, and that we are all equally responsible for its success.  This hike has inherent risks due to the nature of the trail and the speed with which we will hike it.   Ultimately your safety and your assessment of whether the risks are worth it is up to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
