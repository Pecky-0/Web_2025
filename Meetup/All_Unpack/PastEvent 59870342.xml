He is an informative, entertaining and amiable speaker. He strikes a comfortable balance between his medical training and scientific knowledge, and his many years of practicing meditation. Those in attendance were fascinated by his subject matter which he presented in a clear, organized and relaxed manner. His presentation is a mix of scientific and anecdotal evidence punctuated with humor and personal asides.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>clare vidich</member_name><member_id>6909709</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334276883000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-588</urlname><id>1096567</id><group_lat>41.7900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The Storrs Mansfield Meditation Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334001587000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Healing Power of Meditation</name><id>59870342</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334271600000</time><rsvp_limit>50</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-588/events/59870342/</event_url></item>
