The past two years we had so much fun! There were over 30 people here last year and all came up with amazing pumpkin designs and brought a delicious and plentiful spread of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for an afternoon of carving, food and fun. We'll set up carving (or painting, if you wish) stations. We'll toast the pumpkin seeds, enjoy spiced &amp;amp; spiked cider, and enjoy food and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring Your Own: - pumpkin - carving knife - snacks/drinks to share Time: 3 pm - whenever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place: Our home in West Roxbury (bordering Brookline and Jamaica Plain). ***Note: I will provide the exact address and my phone number to those who RSVP.*** Tons of free parking here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College Football fan? Don't worry -- we'll have the games on so you don't miss a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
