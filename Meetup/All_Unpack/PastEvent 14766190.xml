<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>This film is part of a French film festival at Amherst Cinema.  This event is sponsored by Holyoke Community College and they are offering an introduction before the film as well as an opportunity to stay for a discussion afterwards.  This is the only screening, so I suggest you purchase your ticket in advance.  The movie is at 7:30 pm, let's meet in the lobby at 7:10 pm if you'd like to sit together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's some info on the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his father has a sudden heart attack, itâ€™s up to thirty-year old Antoine, a young man who has distanced &lt;br /&gt;himself from his roots, to take over the family business. Leaving behind his dead-end job as a waiter and his &lt;br /&gt;tiny apartment in Paris, he grudgingly moves home to Provence, in the south of France, to run a small mobile &lt;br /&gt;grocery store. In this subtle, closely-observed film, Eric Guirado has a sharp eye for detail and dialogue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Romy</member_name><member_id>8392408</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1316475882000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>French Speakers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>westernmassfrenchclub</urlname><id>1101087</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4700012207</group_lon><name>The Western Mass French Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1284478155000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Soiree Cinema: Le Fils de L'Epicier</name><id>14766190</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1286925300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/westernmassfrenchclub/events/14766190/</event_url></item>
