There are games, raffles, food and events for people and for their boxers!  A great time to meet new people with boxers and for your boxers to meet new boxers!  Always a fun event!  Hope to see you all there! There is a $10 fee to get in and the fee is for Boxerbuddies not the meet up group. This covers your entry and lunch.  For more information go to www.boxerbuddies.org or feel free to ask me.  I will be there with Bosco and most likely wearing a boxer buddies t-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>This is an event for boxers put on by Boxer Buddies Rescue!</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Kristin</member_name><member_id>4522232</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1221890135000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Boxer Owners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>boxer-340</urlname><id>1175534</id><group_lat>42.25</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4599990845</group_lon><name>The Massachusetts Boxer Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>28</yes_rsvp_count><created>1212518425000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boxer Bash</name><id>8070450</id><headcount>29</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1220803200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/boxer-340/events/8070450/</event_url></item>
