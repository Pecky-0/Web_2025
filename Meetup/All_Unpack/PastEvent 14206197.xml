(FR 16), at a parking area, to the clearing at the summit of Mt. Hale, where there are restricted views over trees that have been steadily reclaiming the formerly bare summit in the more than 40 years since the fire tower was removed. The trail is relatively easy, with moderate grades and good footing, and passes through a very fine birch forest much of the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trivia: The summit of Mt Hale is magnetic and will give your confuse your compass! fun.  We will get a little view here but the better views will be at Zealand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here we will hike to the Lend A Hand Trail.  &lt;br /&gt;This trail connects Zealand Falls Hut with the summit of Mt. Hale, which offers some restricted views over trees that are steadily growing taller. The grade is fairly easy but the footing is rather rough for a good part of its distance, because there are a great many plank walkways across a very wet section. The trail takes its name from a journal for charitable organizations that was edited by Edward Everett Hale, the Boston pastor and author for whom Mt. Hale was named.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next  trail will be Twinway. The trail offers magnificent views from the summits of South Twin Mountain and Mt. Guyot and from the outlook at Zeacliff, and connecting trails lead to a number of other superb outlooks. For its entire length, it is part of the AT.  On my two trips to the Bonds, I found this area a nice place to hang out at. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stretch of trail forms a very important ridge crest link along the north edge of the Pemigewasset Wilderness that connects the mountains of the western part of the region—the Franconia Range, Garfield, and the Twins—to the Bonds, the Zealand-Hale region, the Willey Range, and the northern parts of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next stop will be the AMC Zealand Falls Hut. This hut, built in 1932, is located at 2,630 ft. We will break here and  replenish water supplies before our descend back to the cars via the relatively easy Zealand trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;starting at Hale Brook Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;hike 2.20 mi/2 hr 15 min/+2276 ft on the Hale Brook Trail to Mt Hale&lt;br /&gt;hike 2.70 mi/2 hr 4 min/-1382 ft on the Lend-A-Hand Trail to the junction of Twinway&lt;br /&gt;hike 0.08 mi/3 min/-56 ft on the Twinway  to AMC Zealand Falls Hut&lt;br /&gt;hike 0.20 mi/7 min/-151 ft on the Twinway to Zealand Pond&lt;br /&gt;hike 0.20 mi/6 min/+3 ft on the Zealand Trail to the junction of A-Z Trail&lt;br /&gt;hike 2.30 mi/1 hr 24 min/-431 ft on the Zealand Trail to Zealand Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totals&lt;br /&gt;Distance 7.68 mi&lt;br /&gt;AMC Book Time 5 hr 59 min  add time for breaks and hiker pace.&lt;br /&gt;Elev Gain +2468 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Loss -2209 ft&lt;br /&gt;Elev Change +259 ft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280796277000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1280070565000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Hale, Zealand Falls and Zealand Pond</name><id>14206197</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280667600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/14206197/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/3/5/global_15705637.jpeg</photo_url></item>
