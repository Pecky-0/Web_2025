I'm in the process of checking out some other spaces for a possible 2nd meet-up in August.  I'll keep everyone posted!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope everyone is having a great summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Meghan &amp;amp; Lola&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cancellation procedure: If it is raining, too hot, too cold, etc. a cancellation notice will be sent via email and posted on the meetup website 2 hours prior to the meetup time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: Meetup.com charges each group a $15 a month meetup fee. This is a GROUP fee and if not paid, our Boston French Bulldog meetups, would not exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organizer is in charge of paying this fee every month. It would be greatly appreciated if at each meetup, each member can submit a donation that goes towards the monthly $15 fee. Give $1, give $10. If at the end of the meetup, the organizer has not collected enough to meet the $15, she will pay the difference. If she receives more than $15, the extra would go towards the next meetup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing everyone there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to allow payment by PayPal, I had to put a minimum &amp;quot;Suggested Donation.&amp;quot;  This is just to cover the meetup.com fee.  You can give whatever you feel is appropriate.  The cost is $15 per month, so you don't have to give every month either.  Whatever works for you.  And you can do it through PayPal or at the MeetUp.  Hope this helps!! &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189433350000</updated><rating><average>4.32999992371</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>French Bulldog Owners &amp; Lovers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>BostonFrenchBulldogs</urlname><id>213526</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston French Bulldog Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186844642000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston French Bulldog September Meetup</name><id>6162344</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189260000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/BostonFrenchBulldogs/events/6162344/</event_url></item>
