&lt;p&gt;Class descriptions: &lt;br /&gt;

Level I &lt;br /&gt;

Learn the basic steps and combinations that will ultimately culminate the ability to dance to a complete song with confidence. Instruction in the basic foundational steps of salsa; designed to get you on the dance floor as soon as possible. Whether you&amp;#146;ve never danced, learned to dance with your parents, with friends, or on the feet of your family members this is the level that will bring you into the new millennium of salsa. All you need is a willingness to learn and the confidence to step through the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level Ii/III &lt;br /&gt;

Perfect class for those students who have moved through the eight week session with Art and are ready to fine tune their skills and learn additional techniques. Level 2. Whether you&amp;#146;ve completed level 1 or leaned to dance elsewhere and still desire to take your dancing ability to the next level (must have danced at a beginner level prior to taking this course). Level 2 is engineered to take the foundational steps of salsa and make them smoother. You&amp;#146;ll be introduced to new turn-patterns, shines (or open steps), and partnering techniques. Instruct you in leading (male) and following (female) with more confidence, the importance of posture (while dancing), dancing on the beat (on1, on2, or on the clave), dancing to the level of your partner, and dance flow. Level 3. Now that you&amp;#146;ve completed the foundational work, let&amp;#146;s kick this up a notch ... WEPA!!! More intricate turn-patterns, complex shines (open-steps), adding your style to the dance, and catch and release (how to use the music &amp;#150; musicality). We&amp;#146;ll show you how to take your leading and following to a level of poise admired by others, how you (male or female) affect your partners dancing, and the tree and the ornaments technique.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Emily Kwasniewski</member_name><member_id>35728002</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1334332585000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Conscious Co-Pollinators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>high-vibe-tribe</urlname><id>450677</id><group_lat>41.75</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>High Vibe Tribe</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1334078456000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Take a Salsa Class at Downtown Yoga</name><id>59992612</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1334273400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/high-vibe-tribe/events/59992612/</event_url></item>
