They eat mosquitoes by the thousands, and they give us guano, a rich fertilizer beyond compare, over which wars have been fought in the past! Bats need a place to live. Their western caves are having serious issues with the white nose disease. I will hold a workshop on making bat houses, in JP at the Egleston Community Orchard. Easy and fun! No experience necessary! Come one, come all! Free -- small $5 to $10 donation accepted gratefully if you feel the spirit of giving and abundance, but not necessary! Come to the community orchard and have some fun, and get a bat house to take home or give to someone!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1341843591000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Urban-Homesteaders-League</urlname><id>1466080</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>The Urban Homesteaders' League</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341498210000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Bat House Making!</name><id>72044752</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1341673200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Urban-Homesteaders-League/events/72044752/</event_url></item>
