<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>My quest on the Appalachian Trail continues.  I have planned a two day, overnight event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a 22 mile thru hike from Jerusalem Road, Tyringham Mass to Jugg End.  The first day we will meet at the parking area on Jugg End Rd 9:00 a.m.  From there we will take a vehical to the starting spot on Jerusalem Rd in Tyringham Mass.  I hope to be on the trail by 10:00 a.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day will take us past Sky Hill and Mt. Wilcox.  We will over night at the Tom Leonard lean to.  Day two we will finish the 11 mile section that will lead back to the car on Jugg End Road.  Obviously we then have to get back to the car in Tyringham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a time frames for the time we will finish.  There are too many variables that include what time we break camp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please email me any questions about this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the hike will begin but not where we will meet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Tyringham&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;address=%5B100-157%5D+Jerusalem+Rd&amp;amp;zipcode=01264&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;latitude=42.25045&amp;amp;longitude=-73.2279&amp;amp;geocode=STREET" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the meeting point, Jugg End Road, there is a parking area and a trail sign before you get to Guilder Hollow Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Great+Barrington&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;address=Guilder+Hollow+Rd" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.mapquest.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;== ADVISED MUST-BRING GEAR/SUPPLIES == &lt;br /&gt;* Full pack &lt;br /&gt;* Waterproofed hiking boots -Must be comfortable, &amp;amp; broken in  &lt;br /&gt;* Wool socks &lt;br /&gt;* Layers of cloathing -Avoid cotton as it stays wet.
