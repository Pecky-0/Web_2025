The Pow Wow river runs through downtown creating waterfalls at different levels of the area at heights up to approximately 20 feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's lots to shoot here and the holiday activities will only add to the opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Amesbury is part of the Essex National Heritage Area.  Beth posted a notice about an annual photo contest being held by the national heritage organization.  You can learn more about it here... &lt;a href="http://www.essexheritage.org/photocontest/index.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.essexherit...&lt;/a&gt;  and here... &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/CAPEGroup/messages/boards/thread/7491629"&gt;http://www.meetup.com...&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we will miss this year's deadline, we will be able to get images to submit for next year's deadline if you want to enter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll spend a while shooting in the town square area and then be on hand as it gets dark to shoot the lighted window displays.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be posting more information as the date approaches regarding directions.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you can make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...
