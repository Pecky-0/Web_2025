Be sure to say thank you and let them know when arriving that you are with the Meetup Group! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cost: $10 (own gear) or $15 (gear &amp;amp; lesson) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The address says Boston, but it's more like Hyde Park/Dedham area. Plenty of parking for those who drive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Click Here for Directions!&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you're new and want to learn, please be sure to schedule a belay lesson at least 24 hours in advance with Rock Spot directly to ensure proper staffing on the day of the event.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All climbers will need to fill out a waiver and pass a belay test upon initial visit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions. Feel free to use this wall for carpooling, pre-/post-dinner plans, etc. etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>My harness has bright pink and yellow climb tape with "Roni" on either leg.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Roni</member_name><member_id>10600890</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1300713837000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>Bringing back the weekly climbs. We decided to try out Sundays. A few have tried this out and seem to like this better since it gives us more climb time and that not so rushed feeling after work.
