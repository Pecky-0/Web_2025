<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Yup, let's make this happen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WE WILL BE MEETING AT THE DUNKIN DONUTS ON NH112 AT 7:00 AM&lt;/b&gt;. FROM THERE WE WILL CARPOOL (OR MOVE UP THE STREET TO PARK IN THE GROCERY STORE LOT) TO THE CARRIAGE ROAD. PARKING IS LIMITED AT THE TRAILHEAD SO CARPOOLING FROM NH112 TO THE TRAIL IS PREFERRED. &lt;b&gt;PLEASE BE AT DUNKINS AT 7:00.&lt;/b&gt; IT'S ABOUT A HALF HOUR TO THE TRAIL -- AN EARLY START IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVING A PLEASANT DAY WITHOUT THE RUSH TO GET TO THE TOP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The address is 44 main street lincoln, nh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;we will be hiking Moosilauke via carriage road. it's 5 miles one way with 3,100 ft of elevation gain. So it's a pretty steady gradual climb. this is a 10 mile round trip hike, so don't underestimate it!&lt;/b&gt;The moose on this trail is a great learning mountain. You can really focus on traveling with traction devices (if conditions warrant) and not have to worry about narrow steep trails. The carriage road trail is pretty much a highway compared to hiking trails. Nice and wide, gradual and open. The Moose also gives the full range of exposure. From very covered, to extremely exposed. The goal of this hike will be to have a good time and get as far as we can. The weather looks pretty decent so I don't think we'll have to much difficulty above treeline. However, if the weather turns or the group doesn't think the summit is achievable then THE GROUP AS A WHOLE will turn around. If you are summit crazy and want to get this peak regardless of the group -- then this hike is not for you. We will be traveling at a pace comfortable with the whole group. Speeding ahead of the group is not cool. Start together, rest together, summit together, leave together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be one of the more accessible NH 4K's I'm open to suggestions.... This will be a moderately paced hike and although it will be challenging you don't need to be well versed in winter hiking. This hike can serve as an introduction to winter hiking for those who aren't too familiar. Topics to cover on the trail can include gear selection, trail selection, keeping warm, cold weather care, trail finding, and general information on winter hiking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a hike to a NH 4,000 Footer, so it is by no means an 'easy' hike. Mountain is TBD. This will be a pretty demanding hike. WIll most likely be a 10-12 mile round trip day. Be prepared for full on winter conditions. Meaning proper winter hiking gear is required. Some sort of winter hiking boot and traction (micros-pikes, etc.) this won't be anything to intense... you can leave the ice axes and belay plates at home.  As the date nears I'll update with a more specific gear list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some required gear:&lt;br /&gt;NO COTTON.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy WINTER hiking boots&lt;br /&gt;proper clothing including multiple layers for warmth&lt;br /&gt;some sort of hardshell jacket&lt;br /&gt;at least 2L water, a thermos of cocoa is a good idea. &lt;br /&gt;snacks, food, candy bars, yummy stuff. &lt;br /&gt;hiking poles with snow baskets&lt;br /&gt;traction devices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the date nears I'll update. &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Sean</member_name><member_id>5843805</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1292209232000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>randomites</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>random-hikers</urlname><id>492954</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Random Group of Hikers</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>10</yes_rsvp_count><created>1290906583000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Winter(ish) NH4K (Moosilauke via carriage road) </name><id>15570433</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1292068800000</time><rsvp_limit>15</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/random-hikers/events/15570433/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/c/c/global_19472508.jpeg</photo_url></item>
