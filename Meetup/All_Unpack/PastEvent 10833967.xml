The Barking Crab is a casual seafood restaurant on the Boston harbor waterfront.  Meet us there by car, T or paddle there with us! We'll meet at our normal practice meeting spot at 4:30,  paddle to the Barking Crab (a leisurely 15min paddle), have dinner, and paddle back.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have thought you wanted to try dragonboating but never had a chance to come out to one of our practices, this would be a great way to try it out in a low-pressure, informal setting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One requirement: if you paddle there, you have to paddle back.  It's not far, or a strenuous paddle, but it's just difficult to get a dragonboat back to our docks if people choose not to paddle back.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your'e interested in joining us, please RSVP to the meetup, or you can email any of the organizers.  Hope to see you there.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306933093000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Paddlers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>paddle-boston</urlname><id>1135553</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Living Root Dragon Boat - Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247095279000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Paddle to the Barking Crab Restaurant!</name><id>10833967</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247949000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/paddle-boston/events/10833967/</event_url></item>
