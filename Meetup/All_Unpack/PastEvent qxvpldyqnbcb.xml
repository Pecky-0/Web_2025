Co-leaders (Sheila and Julie C) of the Wedeln Ski and Outdoors Club will hold Ski Fitness training every Monday night from September 24th through October 29th for 1hr.  We will meet at the track in the Joe Moakley Park in South Boston.  There is plenty of free on street parking or the lot off Day Blvd or the lot near the beach by the State Police station.  There is no charge - we are just a bunch of skiers and riders trying to help each other get in shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants do not have to be a skier, boarder, or racer. Sheila and Julie C will get you working hard and getting results. All fitness levels are welcome but come ready to sweat.  Ski Fitness Training is a great way to get ready for the season and make some friends you can join on the slopes when the weather gets colder. Please wear work-out clothes and athletic shoes with some ankle support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;** Julie C and Sheila are not certified instructors, just avid skiers who want to get in shape for the ski season with other fellow skiers.  Participation in this program is voluntary and Julie C and Sheila are not responsible for any injuries incurred as a result of the workout.  Participants assume full risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
