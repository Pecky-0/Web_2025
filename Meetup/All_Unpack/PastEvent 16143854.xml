And a great deal at only $5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was his mother’s final wish to see the sea once more. But now Vincent’s mother is dead. And he keeps her ashes in a candy tin under his bed. Vincent wants to fulfill this last wish for his mother. He is just waiting for an opportunity to run away from the home where he is stuck because of his Tourette-syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with anorexic Marie, compulsive Alexander and a car stolen from the home’s doctor, Dr. Rose, he embarks on the long drive to Italy, to the sea. His father and Dr. Rose are hot on their heels. This marks the start of a momentous adventure, at the end of which there is only one certainty: none of them will ever be quite the same again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany 2010&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Ralf Huettner&lt;br /&gt;95 min, 35 mm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the film we'll go to an area restaurant for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>After the film I'll be near the exit with a Meetup sign.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Lisa</member_name><member_id>1230356</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1296408152000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>people</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>307808</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston International/Arthouse Movie Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1295713910000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Vincent Wants to Sea (Vincent will Meer)</name><id>16143854</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1296403200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-International-Arthouse-Movie-Meetup-Group/events/16143854/</event_url></item>
