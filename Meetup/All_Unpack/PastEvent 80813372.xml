Too much sex!?!? A world of excess! When trouble statesman Duke Vincentio goes undercover as an elusive man of the cloth to save his realm from their own self-created misery, the sparks fly as lawlessness is transformed from the letter of the law to the compassion found in the spirit of the law. Heads roll and hearts open as the players move from human misery to the mystery of being human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are less than a cup of stale coffee ($1) so give the TV a break and come enjoy an evening of live theater starring our talented students.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Rich K</member_name><member_id>9340572</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1361506211000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Jumbos</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group</urlname><id>1505274</id><group_lat>42.4000015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Tufts Faculty &amp; Staff Social Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1346785428000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Jumbo Theater: Measure for Measure</name><id>80813372</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1361494800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Tufts-Faculty-Staff-Social-Group/events/80813372/</event_url></item>
