<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;No Limit Texas Hold 'Em Tournament at Mitch's in Hartford. Beginners are welcome. It's a $20 buy in with no rebuys or addons. Please bring an extra $1.00 to pass along to Nina for Meetup website fees as well. A couple of snacks and soda will be provided, but feel free to also bring along a snack. BYOB.  This is a ONE-table tournament so PLEASE:  If you RSVP and then find you can't attend, change your RSVP as soon as possible so someone can take your place.  If we have 8 players, the payouts will be $80, $50, and $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with 1000 worth of chips.  Blinds will start at 10-20 and go up every 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to email me with any questions!  Looking forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:  &lt;span style="color : #ffff00 ; text-decoration : underline"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size : medium"&gt;The starting time for this tournament is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong style="font-size : medium"&gt;7 PM, not 7:10 or 7:30&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size : medium"&gt;Please be on time. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Please don't arrive at 7:10 and expect to play unless you've called ahead to say you'll be late. In other words, if you're not here &lt;strong&gt;AT&lt;/strong&gt; 7:00 and I haven't heard from you (or been able to reach you), I WILL assume you're not coming.  It's really NOT that hard to pick up the phone and keep us posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never played before, don't hesitate to come!  First, because the best (and really only) way to get comfortable with tournament poker is to DO IT!  Second, because we're a very friendly group and we'll be patient with you as you pick up the basics.  Third, because, as a beginner, experienced players will find you very unpredictable.  This makes you a viable threat, and you may even end up winning!&lt;/p&gt;
