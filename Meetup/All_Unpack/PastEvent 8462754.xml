The menu for the evening is being prepared by the illustrious caterer, Marianne Wilson of Wilton, CT, and consists of a succulent pumpkin soup with fresh crusty bread and a fall salad followed by apple crisp dessert. Platters of gourmet cheese and snacks selected by the buyers for &amp;quot;Say Cheese&amp;quot; in Simsbury will circulate to compliment the brews. Wine will also be served. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be live music by local artist. Kristen Graves, Singer &amp;amp; Songwriter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kristengraves.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.kristengra...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/kristengravesmusic" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.myspace.co...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is being held in a lovely Southport home. The address will be made availabe to those who RSVP &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This home is being opened up and the tasting and dinner are being provided as a fund raiser for my organization Covenant to Care for Children. www.covenanttocare.org &lt;u&gt;There is no cost to attend but a donation per person is requested and expected.&lt;/u&gt; Donations above $35.00 are deductible.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to raise $15,000.00 from our guests. The host and owner of the home will match whatever we bring in up to $15,000.00. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an opportunity to visit a beautiful home and garden, meet new people, support an important organization for CT, taste some local seasonal brews and fine wines and have a yummy dinner. What better way to spend a Sunday evening? Please spread the word to people you know, especially in Southwestern CT. Please plan on attending and bring a friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well-behaved kid friendly environment. &lt;br /&gt;Any questions just email or call me. Thanks for helping make this event a success!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I will be wearing my name tag and greeting everyone</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>caryl</member_name><member_id>5833728</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1224282012000</updated><rating><average>3.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group</urlname><id>874344</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>Fabulous Foodies</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1217703302000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Southport Seasonal Local Brew Tasting and Dinner </name><id>8462754</id><headcount>45</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1223238600000</time><rsvp_limit>200</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Hartford-Cooking-And-Recipes-Meetup-Group/events/8462754/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/1/5/global_3916629.jpeg</photo_url></item>
