Schmoozing begins 5.45 and continues from 7.30 onwards after the speakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stimulating talk with Art Director Fred Caserta of Caserta Design Company and Photographer Aaron Kotowski of Aaron Kotowski Studio. Fred and Aaron will talk about their experiences working on recent advertising and editorial projects together. Focus will be on how they optimize the creative flow as a project evolves from it's inception to completion, common mistakes and how to avoid them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A brief peek into the portfolios of both Fred and Aaron will follow. Examples of work theyÂ´ve done for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Connecticut Food Bank, COX Communications, Land Rover, Motorola, and others should spark an informative question and answer period at the end of the session. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;David&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps - Speakers needed for future events, please volunteer!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please gather at the front bar.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David Fischer</member_name><member_id>3013881</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Alicia Guzman</member_name><member_id>5290549</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>user 6649257</member_name><member_id>6649257</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>14</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1207345621000</updated><rating><average>4.25</average><count>4</count></rating><why>To meet other members of the community and to hear about how photographers and designers can work together.</why><group><who>New Haven Creative People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NHDesignTech</urlname><id>283863</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>New Haven Design &amp; Technology Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1205362408000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Greater New Haven Design and Marketing April Meeting</name><id>7520471</id><headcount>13</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1207172700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NHDesignTech/events/7520471/</event_url></item>
