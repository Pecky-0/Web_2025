It's an international best seller with all the elements of both a classic thriller and strong literary credentials.  Lisbeth, the heroine of sorts, has been called the most fascinating female in decades.  You'll love her but she's twisted and flawed, which makes her all that much more charming.  It's long and somewhat slow starting but it's worth all the time you invest in it.  I think you're going to love it.  I've already read the sequel and the third book of the trilogy comes out in May.  Join us March 28th for a great discussion of &amp;quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.&amp;quot;    Elaine &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elaine    </member_name><member_id>7294680</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1269979686000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Brookline Book Readers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>brooklinereads</urlname><id>332113</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Brookline Book Club Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>15</yes_rsvp_count><created>1267407303000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brookline Book Club</name><id>12738116</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1269806400000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/brooklinereads/events/12738116/</event_url></item>
