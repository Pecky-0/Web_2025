&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the 4th I will be hosting a day of a day of awesomeness at my place!  Starting at 4pm there will be a host of options.  And afterwards we'll go check out the fireworks on the Cambridge side of the river!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, plenty of improv games and quirky fun strewn throughout the evening.  So if you want to get your improv on please come on by!   And bring friends!  Those who would like to join some improv games step on in and others can sit back and take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, I'm not sure how many of you have ever heard of Laughter Yoga, but its not full fledged yoga but it is full fledged laughter and I have been hosting all over Boston the last 3 years, so I will offer a couple 30 minute laughter sessions with who ever wants to join in.  Check out this cnn story!  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eB3ISAYE-I" class="linkified"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eB3ISAYE-I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for those that don't know, I graduated from my yoga teacher training and am now a full certified yoga instructor.  With that I will be offering classes, short intro sessions and a couple classes throughout the the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all and else, this day is meant to be a day of community and creativity and freedom afterall. It's a POTLUCK!  Bring some food, bring some fresh fruit, bring some yummy dessert!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And bring some art, a painting project, a hat you knit, some phootographs, a story to tell, or just bring yourself.  I'll have some art supplies out to play with and create and some fun ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok that was all a mouthful but incubator has been alive and kicking for 6 years so let's celebrate and have some fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if anyone has any questions! Just shoot me an email!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all is over we'll walk over to watch the fireworks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small donation of $5-10 would be appreciated to cover costs, but anything is appreciated and feel free to just come on by and enjoy regardless if you can donate something or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also earlier in the day before 4pm, if you'd like a private yoga class or have a small group for a private yoga class, email about rates and info as I'll have 50% off for the day!  I can teach one hour session starting 8am and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much peace, laughter, and basic human goodness to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Jedrusiak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
