We will walk for 2 hours along  through Franklin Park, and then have lunch at Dogwood Cafe across from the FH station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FRANKLIN PARK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;quot;country park&amp;quot; is the largest park (527 acres) and crowning jewel of Olmsted's work here. Named for Benjamin Franklin, the park brings together rural scenery, a woodland preserve and areas for active recreation and sports. Franklin Park also has six miles of roads and fifteen miles of pedestrian and bridle paths to explore.&lt;br /&gt;Scarboro Pond, Ellicot Arch and the Wilderness (part of the Necklace's historic forests) are special places to visit. The eighteen-hole William J. Devine golf-course (the second oldest public course in the nation) and the Franklin Park Zoo (added in 1911) are also favorite destinations. Schoolmaster Hill offers a spectacular view of the Blue Hills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1169614625000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1169187519000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Franklin Park walk</name><id>5407156</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1169306100000</time><rsvp_limit>16</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5407156/</event_url></item>
