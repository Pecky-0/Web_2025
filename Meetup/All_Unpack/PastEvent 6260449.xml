A seasoned performer with many CDs to his credit, a consummate storyteller, and now the published author of an autobiographical collection of twelve poignant, humorous stories, Memoirs of a C Student, Don White will take you on a roller coaster ride of hilarious peaks and heart-quieting moments recalling your own most human experiences through the telling of his own stories in spoken word and songs.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tickets are $16 in advance, $18 at the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year they let me email them my RSVP list 2 days in advance and would let those people pay the advance price at the door. They could always revoke my privilege if I get too many no-shows or if they expect a sellout.&lt;br /&gt;You can also pay them via paypal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee and snacks are available there, for a suggested donation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.uunashua.org/simplegi/index.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.uunashua.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.uunashua.org/map.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.uunashua.o...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you arrive late I can't promise to hold a seat for you with us.&lt;br /&gt;I'm listing this event with other groups too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assistant organizer Neil&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>FAN Alliance</member_name><member_id>3072150</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1190676039000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>SUPER FAN's</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Friends-Activity-Network</urlname><id>400492</id><group_lat>42.7599983215</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4700012207</group_lon><name>The FAN Alliance</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1188354598000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Humorous Folk Music Coffee House - Don White</name><id>6260449</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1190502900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Friends-Activity-Network/events/6260449/</event_url></item>
