Mentioned in our first Meet-up ever, this has been hanging in the background since.  But no more!  It'll be our december read, and thus, the last read of 2007 for our humble crew.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an NPR interview with the author that provides an excerpt and a brief summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4961669" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.npr.org/te...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're heading to the Harvest Co-Op cafe again, mostly on account of their super comfy couches.

The couches are in the cafe facing Mass Ave.  If you're in the store, head out towards the street and you'll find the cafe and your literate peers:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See ya then!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>cathy</member_name><member_id>4263429</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1197300327000</updated><rating><average>4.71000003815</average><count>7</count></rating><group><who>Book Readers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bookclub-797</urlname><id>507213</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>20ish &amp; 30ish Boston Book Club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194916034000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Cambridge Meet-Up</name><id>6729941</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196985600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-797/events/6729941/</event_url></item>
