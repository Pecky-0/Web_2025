We will be discussing that in addition to progress in collaborating with designers for an event which we are planning. The goal is for the event to take place towards the end of September. There will be a strong relationship in themes between both the fashion and musical content of the event. We welcome everyone that has the commitment to make this happen and is passionate about creativity.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>A table is reserved for us.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Evan</member_name><member_id>2523024</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250722863000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>fashionandmusiceventplanning</urlname><id>1408370</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Fashion and Music Event Planning</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1245279898000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Fashion and Music Event Planning Group July Meetup</name><id>10675677</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1247695200000</time><rsvp_limit>11</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fashionandmusiceventplanning/events/10675677/</event_url></item>
