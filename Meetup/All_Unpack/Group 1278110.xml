&lt;br&gt;

 Boston Startup Pitch Night's events are run by a leadership team that works to find the meeting venues and plan out and execute all the Meetup events.  Our mission is to be known as the place to practice your pitch, to receive feedback on your pitch from peers, and most importantly, to be a supportive and fun way to practice your pitch and meet other like-minded startup and technology people. We look forward to meeting all of you and hearing your startup pitches!&lt;br&gt;
