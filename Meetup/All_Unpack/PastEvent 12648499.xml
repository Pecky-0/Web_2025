You can learn read about the featured films here: &lt;a href="http://www.brown.edu/Project/French_Film_Festival/about/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.brown.edu/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be watching the movie &lt;i&gt;Un Phrophète&lt;/i&gt;. Let's meet at 8:45pm to purchase tickets/get in line. The movie starts at 9pm. Here are more details about the movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Un Prophète (a prophet)&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Jacques Audiard&lt;br /&gt;France | 2009 | 155 mn &lt;br /&gt;Cast: Tahar Rahim, Niels Arestrup, Abel Bencherif &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.un-prophete-lefilm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;View website and trailer&lt;/a&gt; (in French)&lt;br /&gt;Sentenced to jail for six years, Malik does not know how to read or write. He is a lost 19 year old trying to survive the hell of prison. To survive, he has to make alliances. Upon his arrival, he falls under the spell of a group of Corsican Mafiosi who control his life inside but also outside during the few times he is allowed a furlough. Slowly, Malik begins to understand the game he has to play to survive. This brilliant film by Jacques Audiard (The Beat That My Heart Skipped) won the Grand Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. A tough film not to be missed…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie tickets are $8.50, or $50 for 8 general admissions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the group decides so, we can go out for a late night snack and/or drinks afterwards. Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268409439000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Friends</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>providence-newcomers</urlname><id>530714</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4000015259</group_lon><name>Newcomers to the Providence Area</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266601827000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Un Phrophète // French Film Festival</name><id>12648499</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267839900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/providence-newcomers/events/12648499/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/3/1/global_9136913.jpeg</photo_url></item>
