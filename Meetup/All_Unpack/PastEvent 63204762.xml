The plan was to leave Boston aboard their 50ft ketch (Triumph) and head for Europe. Unfortunately, just southeast of Nova Scotia, Doug and his wife had to be rescued. First-hand experience taught them about the mistakes they made along the way and more importantly when they should have called for assistance versus when the original call was made. Doug will share with us what went wrong on his trip, solutions he came up with, and what happened during his rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
