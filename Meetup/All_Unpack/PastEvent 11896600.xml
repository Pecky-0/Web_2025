Old School :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be times when the whole bar will be singing along with you - It's the coolest thing!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eat, drink and be merry as you sing along to your favorites. No problem if you don't know the words. You'll get a free songbook with lyrics to more than 500 songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emphasis in on rock/oldies from the 50's, 60's, and 70's, with plenty of show tunes and standards, too. Stop by and see why so many people have said that Friday night at Jake's is the most fun they've had in Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, there are also all kinds of domestic and imported beers on draft, and Jake's dinner menu to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Channel 5’s Chronicle opened with Jake’s Friday Night Sing-Along on a special ‘night out’ program that was devoted to out-of-the-ordinary fun things to do in Boston without spending a lot of money. Watch the replay on the &amp;quot;Chronicle HD&amp;quot; page at thebostonchannel.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a sing-along fan – as a vocalist, a hummer, or just a listener, you'll have a great time as pianist Mel Stiller does his thing from 8pm until midnight. It's been a Boston tradition since 1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Please RSVP</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Michael </member_name><member_id>8251672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260369010000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Brunch Lovers</who><join_mode>closed</join_mode><urlname>Brunch-Lovers-Wanted</urlname><id>1307817</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Brunch &amp; More (20/30-Somethings for brunch &amp; more, etc...)</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1258485607000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Food, Beers &amp; A Piano Side Sing Along @ Jacob Wirth's - Old Sch.
