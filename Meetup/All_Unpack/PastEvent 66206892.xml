&lt;p&gt;Austrian School Economics: Your Window to Understanding the Financial Crisis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few Americans have heard of the Austrian School of economics. In fact, even if you majored in economics in college, chances are you still were never exposed to these thinkers: Carl Menger, Ludwig Von Mises, Friedrich Hayek or Murray Rothbard. But their disciples were the only ones to accurately predict the current financial crisis, back when mainstream economists were forecasting rising housing prices for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael will explain how the Austrians were able to see that the dot-com and housing bubbles would collapse, and why they see an even greater crisis ahead. Also, Michael will discuss strategies to protect yourself and your family during these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
