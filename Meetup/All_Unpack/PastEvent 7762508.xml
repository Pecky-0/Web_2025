New classes will begin in May.  There are around 40 students presently enrolled in this program, and there is room for more to learn at 1 of 6 levels (from the beginners to the advanced and 4 levels in between.  This meeting will afford an opportunity for those interested to learn, improve, or perfect their Italian, to meet the teachers, to have a first-hand look at the materials, to discuss all of the details of this program and to ask questions that would help to understand what is to be expected of this program. These Italian Language Group Lessons are more than lessons, they are about creating friendships, they are about cultural expression and immersion, they are about sharing experiences and ideas that benefit the totality of the group.  This program, which is in its 3rd year, will be continuing throughout the Summer, Autumn, and Spring, and culminate with an opportunity for students to follow the program to Italy in the late Spring and Summer of 2009 to enjoy a 2, 3, or 4 week full immersion of language, culture, travel and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need further information regarding this meeting, please feel free to contact me at this email address....italianprogram@gmail.com, and/or call me at the following number....617-233-9876.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first orientation will be held at 7:00 pm on Wednesday, April 23rd, and the second orientation will be held at 12:00 noon on Saturday, May 3rd.  I would expect a student who was interested in joining an Italian anguage learning group to attend one of the two meetings.  Both meetings will be held in the downstairs 'function room' at Cafe Paradiso, on Hanover Street in Boston's North End.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your interest,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John&lt;br /&gt;Founder and Director - Italian Program&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>john jordan</member_name><member_id>3198507</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1356157716000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members of this group</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>italian-374</urlname><id>288923</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>The Boston Italian Language Meetup Group &amp; Luned√¨ Italiano</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1208498797000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>NEW STUDENT ORIENTATION - SPRING/SUMMER ITALIAN GROUP LESSONS</name><id>7762508</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1208991600000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/italian-374/events/7762508/</event_url></item>
