I will add the dimensions in later for those who have not seen them, but they are slightly larger than a shoe box. &lt;br /&gt;What can we do with these? Shadow boxes, treasure chests, mini theaters, shrines, whatever we can think about. &lt;br /&gt;I think we will work on these over two sessions- session one (this meetup) we will finalize our ideas and do any preparation we need- sanding, gesso, paint, drilling, and start our projects. I will schedule another session later to finish up, or you can take your box home and work on it there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time: 2-5 pm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A charge of $5.00 per person is requested to help defray the cost of running the studio.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Go up the stairs immediately to the right of the front door to the 2nd floor</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pamela</member_name><member_id>1042340</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>1</waitlist_count><updated>1235327018000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Creative Types</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>assemblageart-29</urlname><id>748373</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Altered Art and Assemblage Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230929089000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Transforming Wooden Boxes</name><id>9428096</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1233514800000</time><rsvp_limit>12</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/assemblageart-29/events/9428096/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/1/1/global_4071601.jpeg</photo_url></item>
