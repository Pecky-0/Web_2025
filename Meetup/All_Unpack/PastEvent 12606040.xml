<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>We thought we would try a new date and time to possibly involve some of our members who can't do our Saturday or weekday night Meetups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you have a favorite game please bring it; otherwise, you know we're well stocked. You are also welcome to bring a favorite snack. We'll have plenty to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have never attended a traditional game night, we usually split up in different rooms to play smaller games of players' choice and then come together for a larger game or two at the end of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* You should know that we are a household with cats, but they will be locked up. The house is also home to a well-behaved one year old, who will obviously not be locked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Parking is available on Upham Street, but it is a little tight. There is generally more parking available toward Orne St., and more parking is available on Orne and Dearborn Streets. In the event of a snow emergency, this event will be canceled. Should the weather turn, please have our number with you.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liv and David</member_name><member_id>2975279</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>5</waitlist_count><updated>1268096567000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Game Players</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>salemboardgames</urlname><id>636262</id><group_lat>42.5200004578</group_lat><group_lon>-70.9000015259</group_lon><name>The Salem Board Games Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266202691000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Sunday afternoon games</name><id>12606040</id><headcount>14</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267383600000</time><rsvp_limit>14</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/salemboardgames/events/12606040/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/d/1/global_11205793.jpeg</photo_url></item>
