Route 111 (at Exit 5 off Rt. 3, Everett Turnpike), leads to the GOP event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will announce the exact meet-up location prior to the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring signs if you have them, but don't worry if you don't have signs or banners. The Nashua Ron Paul Meetup Group will supply 35, 3 x 9 foot banners that we've made for this purpose. We have more events planned with these banners, so be sure to return them after the event&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Joe Ureneck</member_name><member_id>4211251</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1187709013000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Blank The Ballot Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot</urlname><id>504022</id><group_lat>42.2900009155</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Election 2012 -  BLANK THE BALLOT!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1186698560000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Pre-Hillsborough BBQ-Banner Blitz and Sign Wave</name><id>6154019</id><headcount>25</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1187535600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Election-2012-Blank-The-Ballot/events/6154019/</event_url></item>
