&lt;p&gt;Recent feedback...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Had a wonderful time.... The circle was very welcoming and Alan is a competent, incredibly talented, patient and friendly leader. I really had a wonderful time and I'm hoping to make it a regular activity and perhaps bring a friend. &amp;rdquo;   &lt;br /&gt;Irene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo; This was a fun time. Alan's leadership style is loose, offering suggestions and some instruction. Nice group of people, too.&amp;rdquo;  &lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo; It is the best drumming circle in the area! People really come together in a community, and with a community spirit. Instruments are provided if you don't have one. ... &amp;rdquo;   &lt;br /&gt;A former member&lt;/p&gt;
