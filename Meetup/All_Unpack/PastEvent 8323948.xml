You should also take a class at Metrorock if you have never climbed before. Please call the gym in advance to make arrangements. Metrorock will charge you $16 for a daypass if you are not already a member or a punch card holder. For more information see: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.metrorock.com/everett.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.metrorock....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym also has a shuttle to the gym from the T - Wellington Station if you don't have a car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see some of you there! &lt;br /&gt;Lopa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. How to find me:&lt;br /&gt;I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black pants and a green/red/blue shirt. I will wait till 7:15 pm and if you arrive after that you'll have to come find me. :) I will have a description of what I'm wearing on the whiteboard near the restrooms.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I'll be the gal at the picnic table in black pants and a green/red/blue shirt.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Opal</member_name><member_id>3394775</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1220155234000</updated><rating><average>4.59999990463</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1215821116000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Rock Climbing Boston August Meetup</name><id>8323948</id><headcount>22</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1219359600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/8323948/</event_url></item>
