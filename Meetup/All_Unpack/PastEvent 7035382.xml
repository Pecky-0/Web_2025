His life is represented by six different actors representing various Dylan personas.  Seattle Post-Intelligence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I'm Not There&amp;quot; shows how the other docs of Dylan have imposed consistency upon an elusive and mercurial person. What Haynes does is take away the reassuring segues that argue everything flows and makes sense, and to show what's really chaos under the skin of the film. Roger Ebert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I'm Not There&amp;quot; is an epic rock un-biopic, a work of staggering cinematic craft that's part jigsaw puzzle and part meditation on the mysteries of art and stardom. It's most definitely not about the man born Robert Zimmerman in 1941 in Duluth, Minn. Instead, it's about our idea of who Bob Dylan is, or should be, or how he's supposed to behave. And it's about how the artist who took that name was so deeply repelled by the notion that he - or anyone - can be pinned down with labels that he shed his skin again and again and again. Who's the real Bob Dylan? Check the title.
