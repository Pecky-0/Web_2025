I did some research and Clarke's in Fanueil Hall is only charging a $10 cover to get in and they'll even provide a champagne toast at midnight! So, if you weren't able to get into the Liberty bash or just don't want to break your bank tonight, join us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1357081465000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ladies</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostoncitygirls</urlname><id>1166008</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston City Girls</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1356976261000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate NYE tonight without spending a ton of $$!!!</name><id>97208862</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1357003800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostoncitygirls/events/97208862/</event_url></item>
