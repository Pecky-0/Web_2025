Between the 2 groups there'll be 42 of us. &lt;br /&gt;Believe me I wish everyone could go. I will do all I can to fit everyone on the waiting list in. &lt;br /&gt;There are about 9 members on the waiting list! &lt;br /&gt;If you rsvp'd yes and you're not sure if you're going PLEASE change you're rsvp to a NO and join us another time. I'm getting e-mails from members on the waiting list asking to me moved to the yes rsvp. &lt;br /&gt;If you rsvp yes and don't show up you ruin it for someone else that really wanted to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As organizer I thought the best I can do for the group is go there for lunch on Monday and check this place out and see how small this place is and if I can raise the reservation from 40 to 50 or just leave it at 40 and see if there'll be room for another 10. If that's the case I'll move everyone from the waiting list to &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, If you RSVP &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; PLEASE show up.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Ask Hostess for the "Meetup Group"</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Mark</member_name><member_id>3673693</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1232812105000</updated><rating><average>4.28999996185</average><count>14</count></rating><group><who>Fun People</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>funstuff40</urlname><id>330793</id><group_lat>42.1500015259</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5199966431</group_lon><name>Fun Stuff</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>26</yes_rsvp_count><created>1228350296000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>THE CHICKEN BONE!</name><id>9275862</id><headcount>26</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1232236800000</time><rsvp_limit>31</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/funstuff40/events/9275862/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/4/global_6829172.jpeg</photo_url></item>
