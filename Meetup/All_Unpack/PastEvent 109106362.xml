This film was originally scheduled for March 8 &amp;amp; has now been rescheduled for April 7th. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Pitch Perfect&lt;/strong&gt; (inspired by the book by Mickey Rapkin). Beca is that girl who’d rather listen to what’s coming out of her headphones than what’s coming out of you. Arriving at her new college, she finds herself not right for any clique but somehow is muscled into one that she never would have picked on her own: alongside mean girls, sweet girls and weird girls whose only thing in common is how good they sound when they sing together. Stars Anna Kendrick. 112 mins. Comedy/Romance. Rated PG-13. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

20 free copies of the book from which the film has been adapted will be given out. Limited seating.
