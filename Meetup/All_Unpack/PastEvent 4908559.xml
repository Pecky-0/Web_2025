It is very crowded there so when you walk in, there will be a sign lit up that says &amp;quot;Theaters 3-19&amp;quot;. Buy your tickets first, and then wait nearby the sign  otherwise we will have a tough time finding each other. The movie starts at 8:15, i believe the movie came out last weekend so you would want to get there early to buy your tickets. Do you guys want to get something to eat before? Or do you want to just meet up after you buy the tickets? If you want to meet up before the movie get there around 7:30. Get back to me if you think we should meet at a different time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Doreen Charbonneau</member_name><member_id>2902873</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273540205000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>movies-280</urlname><id>225256</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Boston Movie Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>3</yes_rsvp_count><created>1145748868000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>MEDFORD/BOSTON MOVIE GOERS FAN MEETUP GROUP Meetup</name><id>4908559</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1148771700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/movies-280/events/4908559/</event_url></item>
