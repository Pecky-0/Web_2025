She wrote a book about her life and personal spiritual journey. It is called Giving Birth to God: a woman's path to enlightenment. She was a home birth midwife for 17 years and a mother of 4 children.  Currently, she lives in Colorado and travels throughout the country giving lectures and classes about peace and having a one on one connection to your inner Self.  She only comes to Boston 3 times a year so you don't want to miss it. The fee is to cover her airfare.  Please join me at this special event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Spiritual Seeking to Spiritual Mastery&lt;br /&gt;Many people are spiritual seekers and many believe that they will remain seekers their entire lives. It is possible, however, to move beyond being just a seeker and into actual finding and working toward spiritual mastery. Mother Clare Watts, author of &amp;quot;Giving Birth to God: A Woman's Path to Enlightenment,&amp;quot; has traversed the path from seeking to mastery, and now co-directs a mystical school that offers help for that inner journeyto those who desire it. Come join her and discover what it takes to move beyond being a seeker only. There will be plenty of time for questions and for a hands-on experience of moving more deeply into the spiritual world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;Rev Gabrielle&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1189983943000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1189568186000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar: From Spiritual Seeking to Spiritual Mastery</name><id>6341738</id><headcount>15</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1189810800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/6341738/</event_url></item>
