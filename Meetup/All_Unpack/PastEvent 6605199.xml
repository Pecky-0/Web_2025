This time it looks like a great event for a great cause!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAYREP Benefit for Haley House&lt;br /&gt;Tickets:  $20 in advance, $30 at the door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each year, BAYREP and a network of co-hosts hold a networking evening to raise money for a deserving non-profit.  This year?s beneficiary is Haley House, a trim, feisty non-profit, started in 1966 in Boston's South End.   The organization?s food program serves 40,000 meals per year to the homeless, its food pantry distributes 16,000 pounds of food per year, it owns/manages 107 units of affordable housing in the South End, and uses its bakery job training program to provide new skills and job opportunities to the chronically underemployed in the heart of Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for this fun and worthwhile networking event!  All event revenues go directly to Haley House: &lt;a href="http://www.haleyhouse.org/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.haleyhouse...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information about this event is available at the BAYREP website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bayrep.org/benefit2007.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bayrep.org...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Co-Hosted by:  Black Architects Forum (BSA committee), BosNoma, Boston Society of Architects Young Professionals Network (YPNet of BSA), CHAPA, Community Design Resource Center of Boston, Congress For New Urbanism Next Generation, Harvard?s Housing GSD, NAIOP Developing Leaders, NEWIRE, MIT Housing Group, REFA, and ULI Young Leaders Group &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Event Sponsors:  Aerotek, Anglo Irish Bank, Architectural Heritage Foundation, BU Center for Professional Education, Cornerstone Realty Consultants, Fidelity National Title, Nutter and Recap Advisors, Tranzon Auction Properties&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sponsorships:  Haley House needs your company to sponsor!
