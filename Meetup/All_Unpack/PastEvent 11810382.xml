No worries, Transcriptions is making your November brighter and more transtastic with TWO events this month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our November 12 feature, Michelle Barrett is an original singer-songwriter with a penchant for folk pop, blues, and alternative country. Love, loss, and lust fuel the heart behind the big voice, while she accompanies herself on guitar. The music is much less about performance than it is about connection and communication. As such, she is rarely more than one woman with one guitar trying to deliver a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceeds from our vegan bake sale will go to the Transgender Emergency Fund, providing financial assistance and relief to low-income trans folks in Massachusetts. Members of the Boston Dyke March will be some of the people baking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Transcriptions is a radically inclusive queer open mic. Read a poem, play a song, spit a rhyme, bust a move, tell a joke...Transcriptions is for our community, our friends, and YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Stay tuned for our special benefit show for Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition (MTPC), on November 19 at The Crossing!**&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>jo</member_name><member_id>3137718</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Boston Dyke March</member_name><member_id>3425442</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elisa</member_name><member_id>5219005</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Anna</member_name><member_id>5396090</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>stephanie</member_name><member_id>5693742</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>spencer</member_name><member_id>5978741</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258244607000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Friends of the Boston Dyke March</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostondykemarch</urlname><id>997856</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Dyke March</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1257496894000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Transcriptions: featuring Michelle Barrett &amp; Benefit Bake Sale</name><id>11810382</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258071300000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostondykemarch/events/11810382/</event_url></item>
