Skis? or maybe you would just like to get the family out to play in the snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather permitting, I want to test out my X skis and new boots on these wonderful ski trails here and maybe you would like to come too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hikers can meet earlier, but its a sleep in day for me and a few hours of skiing will be enough. With mixed activities, We can set an end time of 3:30pm and head over to the Irish pub/restaurant and celebrate.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Gold Honda CRV  phone 603-477-5116 Meet in the lodge entrance</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diane Mancino</member_name><member_id>2347621</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1230394039000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>New England Hikers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-England-Hiking-Meetup</urlname><id>462914</id><group_lat>43.6399993896</group_lat><group_lon>-72.25</group_lon><name>The New England Hiking Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1230106036000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mt Cardigan Hike or Ski</name><id>9383545</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1230220800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-England-Hiking-Meetup/events/9383545/</event_url></item>
