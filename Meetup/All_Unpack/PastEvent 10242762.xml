<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Weather for Boston on Saturday is 81 Degrees and Sunny.&lt;br /&gt;(That's 27.22 for you Europeans who still use the inferior metric system.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't get out of Boston so I thought I would lead a meetup at Quincy. I will also bring a frisbee to toss around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Directions click &lt;a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/United_States/Massachusetts/Greater_Boston/Quincy_Quarries/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Do not just Google Quincy Quarries or enter it in your GPS because they will send you to the wrong location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good trip for beginning climbers as it will be mostly top rope. You should know how to belay and have your own equipment though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please RSVP if you have a rope so I can make sure we have a good ratio of climbers to Ropes I will probably only be there until 230 or so but it should be a good time without me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pease send me a message if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>By the cut of my jib...</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Pete</member_name><member_id>4925014</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>7</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1240876963000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>18</yes_rsvp_count><created>1240416069000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>SUMMERTIME....And the Living is easy!</name><id>10242762</id><headcount>19</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240668000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/10242762/</event_url></item>
