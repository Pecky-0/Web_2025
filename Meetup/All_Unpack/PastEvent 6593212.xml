Our goal is to bring together 100,000 people to donate $100 each, creating a one day donation total of $10,000,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current committment and more information can be found at this link...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thisnovember5th.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.thisnovemb...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way to make this financial committment possible is to search your house for items you can sell on ebay. Here is a post from DailyPaul.com...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's clear out our garages and such, and sell our extra stuff on eBay and donate the proceeds to the cause. When you list something on eBay, include RP08 in the subject line so that we can all browse our supporter's stuff.... for example, I just listed a Robbie Raccoon, but if you search for RP08 in eBay... it comes up... Great way to raise our $12-mil for the quarter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1194437356000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ron Paul Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>RonPaul-NH</urlname><id>527156</id><group_lat>42.9799995422</group_lat><group_lon>-71.5100021362</group_lon><name>New Hampshire for Ron Paul 2012</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>11</yes_rsvp_count><created>1193018781000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Largest one day political donation event in history</name><id>6593212</id><headcount>999</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1194264000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/RonPaul-NH/events/6593212/</event_url></item>
