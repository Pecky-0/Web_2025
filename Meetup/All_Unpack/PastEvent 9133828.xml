We'll meet outside the theater (or right inside the doors if it's chilly) between 7:15 and 7:30. Call me if you're going to be late or if you need to RSVP last-minute (that is, after 5:00 p.m.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we'll head to Fridays after and chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell: 508-308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD STUFF:&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I'm on a meetup-scheduling kick here! &lt;a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809961074/info" target="_blank"&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;/a&gt; will not be our next meetup (sorry, Ron, it doesn't open until Thursday at midnight!), but it will be soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't wait to find out what the death of James Bond's true love did to him, this movie explains events that happen, starting one hour after he watches his girl betrays him and kill herself. (If you haven't seen &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/" target="_blank"&gt;Casino Royale&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend watching it this weekend.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about the movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;Betrayed by Vesper, the woman he loved, 007 fights the urge to make his latest mission personal. Pursuing his determination to uncover the truth, Bond and M interrogate Mr. White who reveals the organization which blackmailed Vesper is far more complex and dangerous than anyone had imagined.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;Forensic intelligence links an Mi6 traitor to a bank account in Haiti where a case of mistaken identity introduces Bond to the beautiful but feisty Camille, a woman who has her own vendetta. Camille leads Bond straight to Dominic Greene, a ruthless business man and major force within the mysterious organization.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;On a mission that leads him to Austria, Italy and South America, Bond discovers that Greene, conspiring to take total control of one of the world's most important natural resources, is forging a deal with the exiled General Medrano. Using his associates in the organization, and manipulating his powerful contacts within the CIA and the British government, Greene promises to overthrow the existing regime in a Latin American country, giving the General control of the country in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of land.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: firebrick"&gt;In a minefield of treachery, murder and deceit, Bond allies with old friends in a battle to uncover the truth. As he gets closer to finding the man responsible for the betrayal of Vesper, 007 must keep one step ahead of the CIA, the terrorists and even M, to unravel Greene's sinister plan and stop his organization.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll update this meetup a few days before to narrow down the time. Let's meet right outside the theater (or just inside the doors if Jack Frost is nipping). Then we can go get our discounted tickets ($8.50 for FMM members and their guests -- exact  change makes me like you more) and get snacks and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guests are always welcome, but please just make sure to include them in your RSVP so I know how many to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you next Wednesday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cell phone number, if you're late or need directions or have a last-minute RSVP:&lt;br /&gt;508-308-4897.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Dana&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>I look like my pic. :-)</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dana Gillin</member_name><member_id>6519146</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273543866000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Movie Fans</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>FraminghamMovieMeetup</urlname><id>1133762</id><group_lat>42.2700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4199981689</group_lon><name>The Framingham Movie Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>8</yes_rsvp_count><created>1226349461000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Quantum of Solace (007)</name><id>9133828</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1227139200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FraminghamMovieMeetup/events/9133828/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/4/global_3996532.jpeg</photo_url></item>
