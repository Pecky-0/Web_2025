As always make sure to amend your RSVP with the dish your are bringing so those joining up know what dishes will be needed to complete the meal.   Also if you want to bring a friend/spouse have them sign up as an individual as well and bring a separate dish.  Show up at 6:00 - we'll sit down to eat at 7:00 giving people an hour to finish off dishes and mingle over appetizer dishes.&lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1246223565000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Cooks</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club</urlname><id>1354358</id><group_lat>42.3100013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Near Boston 30 something cooking club</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1238639484000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thai cuisine night</name><id>10094310</id><headcount>3</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1240783200000</time><rsvp_limit>8</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/NearBoston-area-30-something-cooking-club/events/10094310/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/c/global_6879276.jpeg</photo_url></item>
