Here's a great opportunity to change that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really want to meet all the folks whose names and pictures we see on our Meetup, but whom we have yet to meet in person. The &lt;a href="http://www.watchcitybrew.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Watch City Brewing Company&lt;/a&gt; in Waltham is a great informal location, ideal to mix and mingle and relax at the end of the week. So come along and have a fun and friendly Friday evening with everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, if you like great grub and/or very fresh micro-brewed beer, then this is the place for you, so c'mon down &amp;amp; join us!!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robyn will be out of town this Friday, so Elaine will be hosting this event. Any questions, please contact Elaine at &lt;a href="http://singles.meetup.com/2367/message/?recipientId=2416024"&gt;E-mail Elaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to Watch City:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 128 North/South, take Exit 26 (Rt 20 East). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Rt 20 East for approximately 1 1/2 miles (7 lights) through downtown Waltham until you see Sovereign Bank on your right. Take that right onto Moody Street. Follow Moody Street until the second set of lights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch City is directly on the left at the intersection of Moody and Pine. There is parking (free after 6 PM) behind the restaurant. Just take the left at Pine Street and the second left after the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer public transportation, the Waltham Commuter Rail Station is just off Moody Street, approx. 2 blocks away from Watch City [&amp;quot;staggering distance&amp;quot; according to some of the locals ? :)]. &lt;br /&gt;Waltham is on the Fitchburg Commuter Rail line, fourth stop after leaving from North Station in downtown Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: &lt;br /&gt;Be careful where you park in Waltham. &lt;br /&gt;Make sure you park in one of the Municipal Parking lots, or in the Watch City parking lot (which is FREE from 6pm onwards). &lt;br /&gt;If you happen to park in the lots in front of or behind the Enterprise Car Rental Agency on Moody Street, your car WILL be towed. It is big bucks and a lot of hassle to retrieve your card from the Tow Yard (We speak from personal experience!).&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Elaine will be at the bar from 6pm-7pm</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Elaine</member_name><member_id>2416024</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Robyn L</member_name><member_id>3649230</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1223665933000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Tall Singles</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostontallsingles</urlname><id>1235066</id><group_lat>42.3600006104</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Boston Tall Singles</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1218551437000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Mix &amp; Mingle at the Watch City Brewing Co. in Waltham</name><id>8527866</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1218837600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostontallsingles/events/8527866/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/9/global_4921033.jpeg</photo_url></item>
