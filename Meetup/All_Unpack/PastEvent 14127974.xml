Opening acts - 7:30 pm; Main acts - 8:15 pm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's enjoy the outdoors. Bring a Chair and enjoy the music under the stars!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring an appetizer or dessert to share. &lt;br /&gt;They also have food for purchase on site: pizza, fried dough, sausage &amp;amp; peppers, hot dogs, hamburgers, ice cream, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This place gets packed. We have to get there early. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over 40 years, Tower of Power has been creating their own kind of soul music. Since 1968, Tower of Power has delivered their unique brand of music to their fans, appearing before sold out crowds as they tour the world each year. Tower’s sound can be hard to categorize, but the band's leader and founding member, Emilio Castillo, has labeled their sound as &amp;quot;Urban Soul Music.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tower's rhythm section lays down a groove like no other band. The band’s horn driven sound is unique, and the way they approach everything, from writing and arranging to mixing and performing, is totally their own. Combine all of that with an outstanding lead vocalist and you have one of the most dynamic groups of musicians to ever hit the stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be joined by PartyExpress and New Haven Wine and Dining Group&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Green Flag</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Margaret</member_name><member_id>7957111</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1280717892000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>dining companions</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>diningout-590</urlname><id>719640</id><group_lat>41.2799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-72.8000030518</group_lon><name>The New Haven Area Dining Out Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>19</yes_rsvp_count><created>1279359278000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Tower of Power</name><id>14127974</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1280530800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/diningout-590/events/14127974/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/5/7/global_3095463.jpeg</photo_url></item>
