One of my Favorite Bike Paths.  The Ride  takes you thru two swamps, from the comfy of a tarred path.  I have seen Deer along the path and plenty of birds.  They added another small section and from there, it is just a couple of miles, to Narragansett Pier. If you want to stay on the Bike Path, you are more than welcome, to do so. Those who want to continue on, will head to The Towers.( FYI: The Towers, it is a R.I. thing LOL )  Then you can follow Ocean Road, to Point Judith Lighthouse. This is very scenic, with plenty of water views.  Since this is an out &amp;amp; back, by the same Route, feel free to go as fast or as slow as you want.  It is about 5 1/2- 6 miles to the Lighthouse.  Go as far as you can.  ( What the Heck, you could even Hang out the Beach &amp;amp; wait for us to return).  We will meet back  at the Towers, at a predetermined time  &amp;amp; I will take you back to the Bike Path.          You can ride 6,12, or even 30  miles.  ( or anything in between) You can set your own pace. I usually split into a few Groups, so everyone can ride at a pace they feel comfortable with.  Feel free to stop and see the scenery.  This is not a race.  There is a restroom at the train station &amp;amp; there is one in Narragansett.         Directions: 95 South / Exit 9, Route 4 South / Route 1 South / Route 138 West / go 4 Miles Left at Light on Route 108 / at the Light go  Right on Curtis Corner Rd. ( NOTE : Sign may say Saugatucket Rd ) / School is down on the Right.&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We are in the Parking Lot, on the Right, in front of the School</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dave N.</member_name><member_id>10478672</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1337645429000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Grinders</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group</urlname><id>1500421</id><group_lat>42.0600013733</group_lat><group_lon>-71.2399978638</group_lon><name>The Foxboro Grind &amp; Grub Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>14</yes_rsvp_count><created>1330815474000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Wakefield Bike Path &amp; Narragansett Shoreline</name><id>54842032</id><headcount>17</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1337529600000</time><rsvp_limit>17</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/The-Foxboro-Cycling-Group/events/54842032/</event_url></item>
