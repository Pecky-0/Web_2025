This is officially longer than most of my relationships, so I am very excited about the possibility of spending more and more time together.  I'm taking it back to our roots by heading to a bar known for its great beer - &lt;b&gt;Bukowski's&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've heard a lot of great stuff about this place and look forward to giving it a shot!  There's two branches - we're going to the one in Inman Square. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to see why we should be going there?  &lt;a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendID=8372334" target="_blank"&gt;Check out their MySpace profile&lt;/a&gt; for a list of all their beers.  Yum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard the food was pretty dang good, too.  RSVP and I will do my best to get us a table. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember - it's cash only.  D'oh!&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>You know my mug by now :) If not you can call my cell.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1216940783000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Drinking Buddies</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>fun-with-alcohol</urlname><id>985138</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0999984741</group_lon><name>Fun with Alcohol!</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1214405621000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Celebrate our 6-month anniversary! :)</name><id>8211885</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1216767600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/fun-with-alcohol/events/8211885/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/e/global_4580686.jpeg</photo_url></item>
