<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who donated to our ChipIn, we now have 10,000 Ron Paul Super Brochure's to be inserted into Reminder Press newspapers in the eastern part of the state! I was hoping to be able to find an inkjet printer capable of printing on them, but the brochure is simply too think. The best option for us are ink stamps. I already had some with our meetup info on them, and I have rush ordered a set of second stamps with CT's primary date April 24th and a message to Register Republican NOW at your town hall, plus a link with the form and a list of town halls. Each brochure needs one of each stamp, and we'll have a total of 4 sets. Depending on the turnout it may be two stamps to a person or perhaps one each if we get 8 or more showing up. They are printed on fairly glossy stock as well and will need a few minutes to dry before being ready for re-boxing. Each and every stamp is one more potential vote for Dr. Paul, one more chance for someone to awaken from their political slumber in this blue state. The plan is to make it fun, we'll put on a documentary or some music and enjoy the company of like minded patriots while we get hands on with the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has to be completed as soon as possible so they can be inserted into the earliest run possible. If this insert is successful I'm hoping it not only helps spread Ron Paul and the ideas of Liberty in CT but might also build a support base for the April 24th push. I know there are Ron Paul supporters in CT who want to help but are unaware of the meetups. Some of them may have even contacted the official campaign and expressed an interest in helping - and as of yet remain an untapped resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting is at a member's house in Colchester at 1p.m. and the address is only viewable if you belong to our meetup. If you would like the address please message me (Earl L) and I will get it to you. Feel free to call 860-730-3RON if you need directions or help finding us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Earl L.</member_name><member_id>4314674</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332787015000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Supporters</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>ct4liberty</urlname><id>525277</id><group_lat>41.8400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-72.4599990845</group_lon><name>CT for Liberty</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332335115000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Brochure Stamping Party!</name><id>57242702</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332694800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/ct4liberty/events/57242702/</event_url></item>
