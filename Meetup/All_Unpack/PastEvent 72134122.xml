&lt;p&gt;It's been awhile since the last meetup so I thought I would keep this one casual and relaxed. I'll be at the Beantown Pub on Tremont Street starting around 5pm and stay until 9:15 to meet as many Southerner's as possible! Feel free to drop by anytime, stay the whole time or only for a while, eat if you'd like and have a beer . . . or a few! As usual, I'll be on the look out for new members and will have a sign so you can easily identify the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing y'all there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Bonnie</member_name><member_id>12912717</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343494172000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Ex-Southerners</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>exsoutherners-38</urlname><id>679749</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Ex-Southerners Meetup Group - Boston Region</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>21</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341534100000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Happy Hour!</name><id>72134122</id><headcount>0</headcount><duration>14400000</duration><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1342818900000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/exsoutherners-38/events/72134122/</event_url></item>
