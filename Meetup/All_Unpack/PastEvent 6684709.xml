Our slow-paced ride [10-12 mph] will take us through Brighton, Boston, Cambridge, Watertown ? approximately 14-16 FLAT miles.  We will ride together as a group and be on a bike path for 95% of the ride.  This ride is more of a fun urban exploration rather than a heavy-duty aerobic workout.  Cold temps will NOT cancel [please layer up and make sure one layer is fleece] but RAIN will.  HELMETS ARE MANDATORY FOR THIS RIDE.  Bring water, a bike in good working order w/fully inflated tires, and a fun/friendly attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RSVP:  Mandatory&lt;br /&gt;MEET: 10:00 am at TC's home, ample on street parking.  Address/directions will be given to those who RSVP.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>David</member_name><member_id>4431256</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1273542539000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>friends and members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>mosaicofmass</urlname><id>416725</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>Mosaic Jewish Outdoor Club of Massachusetts</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1194311789000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>BIKE RIDE ALONG THE CHARLES [AND WORK OFF THE EXCESS T-DAY DINNER]</name><id>6684709</id><headcount>0</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1196002800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/mosaicofmass/events/6684709/</event_url></item>
