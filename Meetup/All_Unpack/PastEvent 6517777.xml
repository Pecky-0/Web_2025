Through this process, it is critical that we focus on both the positive elements of the current Arts and Entertainment Community and on a vision for the future community. With this in mind, please come to the meeting with a pitch for how you would sell Boston as an A&amp;amp;E destination to a non-Bostonian. That is, tell us why he or she should come to Boston instead of New York, LA or Austin for Arts and Entertainment. Likewise, please be prepared to discuss your pitch for a dream A&amp;amp;E Community in Boston.  &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christopher Marston</member_name><member_id>2731493</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1192226552000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Entrepreneurs</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>entrepreneur-674</urlname><id>232461</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0500030518</group_lon><name>Revolve Nation's Boston Entrepreneur Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1191942001000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Entertainment Leadership Council</name><id>6517777</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1192053600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/entrepreneur-674/events/6517777/</event_url></item>
