&lt;p&gt;UU services are open and welcoming, and most first-timers are surprised at how much we have in common. Regardless of your beliefs you are not required to participate in the service if you choose not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All dedicants are requested to attend as part of a service project, the Pagan community at large is also invited to participate. Please wear robes if you have them or at least "your finest pentagrams and witchy things" :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are asked to be at the church by 10 AM and bring a small snack (peanut free, there are some with allergies!). Some Gluten and Sugar free items are encouraged also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All help would be appreciated, whether it be setting up, serving, or cleaning up afterward. It is important that all who are planning on attending RSVP, and let us know what you will be able to bring for a snack or other food dish if you are able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More power to you, and Be Blessed!&lt;/p&gt;
