&lt;p&gt;Our next XcellR8 meeting will be Thursday, June 13th - 8:00 am at Nerac. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Ryan Brielmann and I first met in a UConn School of Engineering classroom and his interests in innovation and entrepreneurship led him to attend and participate in a number of activities as an undergrad. These included attending both XcellR8 and Innovation Connection sessions where he networked with others, sharing his passion and exploring various ideas for product innovations – that and well…free beer. Following graduation last year, Ryan landed a gig with Pratt, but next Thursday morning, he’ll be introducing the XcellR8 group to Brewmann, LLC. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Ryan is asking for your assistance in outlining next steps. It is a really big question. I expect the group to test and challenge the depth of Ryan’s research into the market, to comment on his market outlook and scope of the opportunity, to probe whether the financials and financial outlook is sound and to make suggestions regarding the several marketing approaches Ryan will outline. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Just where does Ryan go from here with his patent pending technology? &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

I look forward to seeing you. Please do let me know if you’ll be able to attend. Thank you. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Regards, &lt;br /&gt;
