This campaign will be episodic with an over arcing story heavy on story, continuity and role playing. You do not need to have played in the first adventure to play in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You found Loreweaver's cipher, but now are stuck in the elven land of Valenar with very few options to get back to Great Crag. Speed is of the essence, the Daughters of Soras Kell don't like to be kept waiting. Still there are unanswered questions. Who attacked the airship? What does Wileak Lorweaver's cipher reveal? How will you get back to Great Crag? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Characters are now level 7. You are allowed one level 8 magic item, one level 7 magic item, and one level 6 magic item from the allowed books. You also have 1800 gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the ONLY source material allowed to be used are the PHB, PHB 2, PHB 3, the Eberron Players Guide and Adventurer's Vault 1, be sure to check the errata for all books here. You must take all races, classes, feats, and magic item choices from those books ONLY. This campaign will be cheddar-light. If you are looking for a min/max meat grinder, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Characters must be approved one week before game time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Regular attendance ensures you a spot at the final episode, which will take place at Templecon 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Players will treat everyone with respect and remember that the object of the game is for everyone to have fun, not just one person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Capping the group at 6 players, will run a second group if needed.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>At a gaming table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>11219434</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1289785261000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Gamers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>dnd-240</urlname><id>47127</id><group_lat>41.8300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4100036621</group_lon><name>The Rhode Island Gamers Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1288286687000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>D&amp;D 4th Edition 5th level Eberron campaign leading to TempleCon, Part 3 of 6</name><id>15260311</id><headcount>5</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1289669400000</time><rsvp_limit>7</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/dnd-240/events/15260311/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/f/global_6578223.jpeg</photo_url></item>
