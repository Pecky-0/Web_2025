<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>It's time for our March Meetup!!!!!  This time we are holding it on a Saturday evening.  Hopefully that works for you.  Please join me for a fun evening of Karaoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Limelight in Boston has graciously offered to let us use their location again.  When you get there please look for me in one of the private Karaoke Rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a terrific time at the February Meetup and I look forward to seeing all of you again in a few weeks.  The Limelight is the perfect place for us to meet, it's conveniently located in the Theater District in Boston, it has a wonderful selection of songs to sing and everyone there is so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will see you there!  If you need anything, my cell phone is 617-429-6571.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;- Phil&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Philip L</member_name><member_id>1522860</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>5</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1163858211000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Members</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>bostonkaraoke</urlname><id>212993</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Karaoke Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1141765443000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Karaoke March Get-Together</name><id>4870057</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1143333000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonkaraoke/events/4870057/</event_url></item>
