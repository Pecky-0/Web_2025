<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My plan is to arrive early (by 1:30 p.m.) to get a spot in line. The taping is a general admission event, so we'll have to meet in line to sit together. Look for me and my bright red backpack and my meetup sign. If you don't arrive early enough to join me in line (I don't recommend cutting the line), look for me in the auditorium. We can find each other during the intermission: I'll still have the red backpack and meetup sign!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event is CLOSED TO NEW Yes RSVPs. Tickets for the Saturday, October 15, 2011, afternoon taping are sold out as of Wednesday, August 31, 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WGBH's radio program Says You!( &lt;a href="http://www.saysyou.net/"&gt;http://www.saysyou.net&lt;/a&gt; ) travels the country taping radio shows in front of a live audience. This fall, Pipit and Finch (the program's creators) will be taping at Bemis Hall in Lincoln, Massachusetts. I&amp;nbsp;attended a taping of Says You! last year, and it was so much fun. And funny, too. Word nerds will definitely appreciate the Says You! brand of humor. If you're a fan of the show, you know exactly what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have purchased a ticket for myself, as follows: Saturday, October 15, 2011, 2:00 p.m. performance (I plan to be there by 1:30 p.m.), General Seating (ticket price is $30.00).&amp;nbsp;Two shows will be taped, with an intermission between them. We can catch up during the intermission, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;Please note: You must purchase a ticket to get into the live taping.&lt;/span&gt; Go to &lt;a href="http://www.saysyou.net/"&gt;http://www.saysyou.net&lt;/a&gt; and click on the "Join the Fun" link&amp;nbsp;for more information about purchasing tickets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;You will receive the address and directions, too, once you purchase a ticket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;I just checked the Says You! website (it's Wednesday, August 31, 2011) and the tickets for the afternoon taping on Saturday, October 15,&amp;nbsp;are already sold out.&lt;/span&gt; If you haven't purchased&amp;nbsp;a ticket, you will not be able to attend the afternoon taping&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Says You! If there is another taping of&amp;nbsp;Says You! in the spring of 2012, maybe that will be another chance for all of us to see this fun and entertaining show.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
