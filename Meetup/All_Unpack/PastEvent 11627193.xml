A gentle and peaceful people, they lived in a community that some might call utopian: sharing with each other and with their neighbors, living in simplicity and humility, and never choosing sides in conflict. They were a godly people who wanted to be ready for the Messiah’s coming and to live as the Christ would have them live. This sect disappeared not long after Jesus’ death and resurrection and it is thought that they integrated into the emerging Christian culture of that time. Come and hear the details of the simple Christian values and lives of the Essenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.CentersOfLight.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're Just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the orange line.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Christine Doucet</member_name><member_id>3401828</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>1</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258850164000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Meditators</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>meditation-684</urlname><id>1246909</id><group_lat>42.3899993896</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Cambridge Meditation Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255548292000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  The Lives of the Essenes</name><id>11627193</id><headcount>7</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258677000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/meditation-684/events/11627193/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/1/3/0/global_6658400.jpeg</photo_url></item>
