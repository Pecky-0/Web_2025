<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Free moderately paced Salter's Pond walk with some historic commentary. Many &amp;quot;North Enders&amp;quot; learned to swim at this pond. Meet at the parking lot of the town swimming pool on Lydall Street, near its intersection with Coleman Road, Manchester, CT. The walk may be wet depending on the weather, and hikers should wear sturdy sneaker, shoes or boots; the route is not mountainous, but does have stairs and bumpy spots, where roots stick out, so participants need to be agile. The walk will take about 1-1/4 hours round trip. Extreme weather cancels. No dogs, please. Part of the CT Forest &amp;amp; Park Association's family rambles, so children are welcome, but then so are single adults. All are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Blue back pack and portable amplifier</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Susan B</member_name><member_id>7644854</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>16</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1248789547000</updated><rating><average>4.5</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Hiking Enthusiasts</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Hartford-Area-Hiking</urlname><id>209210</id><group_lat>41.7700004578</group_lat><group_lon>-72.6999969482</group_lon><name>The Hartford Area Hikingâ„¢ Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1242578297000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Easy walk at Salter's Pond, Manchester, CT</name><id>10430892</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1248541200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Hartford-Area-Hiking/events/10430892/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/6/9/8/global_8663784.jpeg</photo_url></item>
