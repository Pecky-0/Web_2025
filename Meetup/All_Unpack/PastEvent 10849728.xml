Our meetup attendance has been 20+ for the past few gatherings.  So many of us want to be as healthy as we can be and it is becoming very clear that it will not happen on the Standard American Diet.  Time to stop eating processed food with no nutrition!  That is what our group is all about!  Learning how to eat better, live better, feel better.  Potluck...bring a dish of your choice...all raw of course...enough for 6-8 people....that way everyone can have a taste!  The food has been amazing!  Please remember...Organic!  If you are new and you need some ideas....salad, fruit or vegie, is always good.  You can also email me if you get really stuck or check out the web...just google raw food.  Looking forward to seeing all new and old members very soon.  I have already begun thinking about some raw yummy treats I will be making...how about you! &lt;img src='http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/wink.gif' border='0' alt='wink' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>KO Bisson</member_name><member_id>4565632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1252105044000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>5</count></rating><group><who>Raw Foodists</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>rawfood-ManchNH</urlname><id>1292928</id><group_lat>42.9700012207</group_lat><group_lon>-71.4400024414</group_lon><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>22</yes_rsvp_count><created>1247271253000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Manchester Raw Vegan Food August Meetup</name><id>10849728</id><headcount>24</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1249686000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/rawfood-ManchNH/events/10849728/</event_url></item>
