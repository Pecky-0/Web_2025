There is also a vegetarian menu.. You can access the particulars on this quaint place hidden away in a country hillside by going to their website.&lt;br /&gt;Their is also a very nice gift shop in the old barn and it is fun to walk around the gardens which is where they get a lot of the food you eat there. I have been before and it is such a great place to enjoy the new springtime.&lt;br /&gt;The cost is $18.95+tax.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to keep this to about 5 folks as this is not a big place and to eat out in the sunroom requires a smaller group..So, if you are interested please let me know and be sure you want to go...I will have a waitlist but please do not sign up unless you are sure you would be going. &lt;br /&gt;</description><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1274477222000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>2</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1269639912000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Lunch at Pickity Place in Mason, NH</name><id>13002961</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1273932000000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/13002961/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/0/8/global_13798104.jpeg</photo_url></item>
