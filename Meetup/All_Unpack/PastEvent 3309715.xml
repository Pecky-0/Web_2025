<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>bookcrossers talk about books they like, and where and how to release books, and why bookcrossing is so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed the venue to the Someday Cafe in Davis Square and the time to 8:00.  I'm hoping that more people will be able to make it through the traffic by 8:00 if they are driving.  Also the Someday is right out of the Davis Square T stop on the red line.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Liz</member_name><member_id>220016</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1159526497000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>BookCrossers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bookcrossing-195</urlname><id>23495</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>The Boston Bookcrossing Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1095207171000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Boston Bookcrossing October Meetup</name><id>3309715</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1097625600000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bookcrossing-195/events/3309715/</event_url></item>
