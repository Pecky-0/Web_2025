More importantly, breathing is something we can have control over at times when everything else may seem out of control. This unique Energy Re-integrative Breathing practice (ERB) is specifically designed to give you control over your energetic displacement that, as you have learned by now, underlies the entire range of anxiety conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re-integrative breathing is a process that will enable you to fit everything back together.  It will facilitate an alignment through the system of energy gates. The movement of energy through the gates is being controlled using your breath and creates an energetic adjustment, often almost immediately. This alignment is the secret force that will keep you anchored and grounded in the physical body. Armed with this technique, you will be able to better withstand the trials and tribulations of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth mentioning that the ERB technique differs from both the standard practice of “breathing in the bag” and the deep abdominal breathing exercises that are routinely recommended to alleviate stress and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So come and learn the system of Energy Gates and powerful energy psychology techniques that will:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Step-by-step, safely and effortlessly decrease anxiety, eliminate persistent worries, and create states of profound healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Significantly lower your stress levels and lower your levels of brain chemicals related to anxiety, and increase your production of vital (and very pleasurable) brain chemicals related to your well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Dramatically improve your ability to sleep better, focus, concentrate and think more clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Stimulate the creation of new neural pathways between the right and left hemispheres of your brain, balancing your brain and leading you to a high-performance state, scientists call &amp;quot;whole brain functioning”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately millions of people have no choice but to try to live in this debilitating state of discomfort that results from energetic misalignment. You do not want to be one of them. I am inviting you to embark on an exciting journey to the new anxiety and trauma-free you. Come and join us for a highly experiential presentation, live demonstration and personal practices. Warm welcome to everyone! I am looking forward to meeting all of you!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Yuliya Cohen</member_name><member_id>6311859</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255116892000</updated><rating><average>4.67000007629</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>People on a healing journey</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma</urlname><id>1373363</id><group_lat>42.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Freedom from Fear/ Anxiety /Emotional Trauma Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251606642000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Four Gates To Recovery: Breathe Your Way to Wholeness</name><id>11236138</id><headcount>16</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1252623600000</time><rsvp_limit>21</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Freedom-From-Trauma/events/11236138/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/9/b/global_10450251.jpeg</photo_url></item>
