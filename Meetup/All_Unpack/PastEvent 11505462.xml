Bring a rope and other top rope gear if you have it.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey,,, I will try to be at the K wall at 4PM - but just show up and look for me anytime...  I will be in green pants (or black pants).  Bring a flash light (head lamp) if you want to climb into the night.  New climbers are cool.  Just let an experienced person know that you are new and need help.  I will try to bring an extra harness but you should have your own harness and shoes... what else?... Oh yea, bring warm clothing.  &lt;br /&gt;3 cheers:) &lt;br /&gt;Geoff&lt;br /&gt;617 501-6217&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you come late and don't see me ask around. I might be at the C wall behind the little pond.  Feel free to call - I might answer my phone.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>green pants.</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Geoff</member_name><member_id>3444525</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>3</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1255727151000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Climbers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>bostonrocks</urlname><id>406080</id><group_lat>42.3800010681</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1299972534</group_lon><name>Rock and Ice Climbing Boston</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>2</yes_rsvp_count><created>1254282647000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>4 weeks in October - Climb Quincy Quarries.  </name><id>11505462</id><headcount>2</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1255554000000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/bostonrocks/events/11505462/</event_url></item>
