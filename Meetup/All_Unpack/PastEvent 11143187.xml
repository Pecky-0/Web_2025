Thursday event will combine our Happy hour with dinner as well. So Radius it is. Its located downtown in Financial district. Their Restaurant Week 3 course menu does have a vegetarian option for all veggie lovers. You can find it on the website below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://restaurantweekboston.com/link/#radius" target="_blank"&gt;http://restaurantweek...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bostonchefs.com/restaurant/Radius/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.bostonchef...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the entre mentions egg but we have checked and they can make it without egg as well.  After dinner folks can hang out at any bar/club downtown if they choose to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is street parking available in Financial district on High Street, Devonshire, Summer Street which are the closet to the location. As always you can park in any of the parking lots around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Fix Prixe 3 course dinner costs $33.09, drinks, tips and taxes are extra.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karan</member_name><member_id>8985082</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1250983232000</updated><rating><average>4.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>People of Indian Descent/Expats</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>indianheritage-41</urlname><id>1168585</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0599975586</group_lon><name>Indian Friends Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>4</yes_rsvp_count><created>1250640360000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Restaurant week dinner at Radius!!!</name><id>11143187</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1250810100000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/indianheritage-41/events/11143187/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/1/c/global_10053356.jpeg</photo_url></item>
