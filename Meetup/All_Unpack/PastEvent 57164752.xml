Last years was a great success, we had 500 people come down to the airport. Dawn M. has graciously agreed to lead the planning effort this year. She has asked for anyone interested in helping plan the event to stop by the FCA sometime between 9:30 and 4pm this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to help, but can't stop by Sunday or just like to offer a suggestion please send her an email at dawn.marinelli@us.ngrid.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Dawn Marinelli</member_name><member_id>13409709</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1332758379000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Pilots and Co-Pilots</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>FitchburgPilots</urlname><id>1060828</id><group_lat>42.5800018311</group_lat><group_lon>-71.8000030518</group_lon><name>Fitchburg Pilots Association/EAA Chapter 1454 Meetup Site</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>7</yes_rsvp_count><created>1332280536000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Learn to Fly Day Open House Planning</name><id>57164752</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1332682200000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/FitchburgPilots/events/57164752/</event_url></item>
