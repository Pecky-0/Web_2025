Come watch an important game between the two Northeast division teams!  Tickets will be 35 each but may be discounted if we can enough people together.  I have to order the tickets by the 20th, so please RSVP by the 19th.  If you have any questions please contact me. You can either pay for the tickets in full or send me a deposit of 20 dollars per ticket.&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Andrew</member_name><member_id>2881088</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1206935966000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Expat Canadians</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Canucks-in-Boston</urlname><id>29048</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0899963379</group_lon><name>The Boston Expat Canadian Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>16</yes_rsvp_count><created>1204247113000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Boston Expat Canadian March Meetup- Toronto Maple Leafs vs Boston Bruins</name><id>7429640</id><headcount>20</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1206658800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Canucks-in-Boston/events/7429640/</event_url></item>
