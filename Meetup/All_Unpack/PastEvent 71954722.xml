&lt;p&gt;ROCKBOTTOM- is a classic rock cover band. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

Originally started in 2000 as a house band for the now-defunct Lilli's club in Somerville, the group takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to performance (think: wigs, flares, beads, vintage stage banter) but plays their classic material as accurately as possible. The repertoire ranges from Led Zeppelin, Free, and Sweet to Judas Priest, as well as shameless covers of songs by corporate rock mainstays like Foreigner and Journey.

The band members are seasoned area rockers including drummer Jim Janota (Upper Crust, Bags, Lyres) vocalist Chris Cote (Upper Crust, Seks Bomba, Giant Kings) bassist David Fredette (Upper Crust, Titanics) and guitarists Chris Blue (Georgia Overdrive, Rudds, Rag Iron, United States) and Charles Hansen (Andrea Gillis, Gymnasium, Ross Phasor&lt;/p&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>meetup at the bench (by shadey tree) outside The Firehouse -please read description for more info</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1343846430000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><group><who>Explorers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>travel-575</urlname><id>418980</id><group_lat>42.7799987793</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Old and Not so Old Ladies Travel</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1341427779000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Concert Series @ Waterfront Park: ROCKBOTTOM- Classic Rock Cover band</name><id>71954722</id><headcount>4</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1343774700000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/travel-575/events/71954722/</event_url></item>
