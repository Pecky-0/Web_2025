She warns me that this place is very small and gets very crowded, so it is best to get there way in advance of peak dining times. Hence the start time of 5 p.m. on a Sunday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another caveat: Muqueca has no liquor license and no, we can't BYOB. I just hate having to eat feijoada without a caiparinha. . . grrrr. . . but I'll steel myself. Hope you can too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, you must pay a $3 reservation fee to RSVP, but don't worry, you will get it back, sort of. . . I add it in to the bill to cover tax and tip.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa will handle the reservation, which MAY be expandable up to a point, but let's start with 8 people and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>Look for a Meetup tent sign on the table</how_to_find_us><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>irisZ</member_name><member_id>8194464</member_id></event_hosts_item><event_hosts_item><member_name>Melissa Passos</member_name><member_id>8627742</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1268321063000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Gourmet Gurus</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>gourmetgurus</urlname><id>1277459</id><group_lat>42.4199981689</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1100006104</group_lon><name>Gourmet Tasters Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1266718211000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>The Brazilian See-Food Diet</name><id>12659850</id><headcount>10</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1267999200000</time><rsvp_limit>10</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/gourmetgurus/events/12659850/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/f/e/global_13217118.jpeg</photo_url></item>
