 &lt;br /&gt;

(Poland, 2011) Produced, photographed and directed by Lech Majewski. Screenplay by Michael Francis Gibson and Lech Majewski, based on the book by Michael Francis Gibson. Cast: Rutger Hauer, Charlotte Rampling, and Michael York. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

A special one week premiere screening of the awesome new film by Polish writer/director/cinematographer Lech Majewski! In case anyone is still wondering, this is an example of the kind of magic that only moving images on a giant screen can bring alive. You will be transported back to 1564 to see the (re)creation of Pieter Brueghel the Elder&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece, &amp;lsquo;The Way to Calvary,&amp;rsquo; as it is imagined, staged and ultimately appears on the canvas. Brueghel&amp;rsquo;s work is not only a painterly tour de force, it is a social commentary, as the Romans bringing Jesus to his crucifixion are transformed into Spanish militia oppressing Protestant reformers, and the jeering crowds into indifferent villagers involved in their own fight for survival in a brutal society. &amp;ldquo;Visually ravishing! A unique, immersive, museum-meets-cinema experience&amp;rdquo; - Variety. &lt;br /&gt;
