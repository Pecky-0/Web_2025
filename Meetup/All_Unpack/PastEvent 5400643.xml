Should be a great venue to meet new faces and chill out.  And we'll follow that up with dancing at the Liquor Store, a great scene with the infamous mechanical bull.....  you know you want to try it!  Hope to see everybody this Fri. night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plan: Meet at 8pm at the Excelsior (272 Boylston St, next to the Four Seasons hotel).  We will meet inside the bar before heading over to Liquor Store around 9pm. Please try to meet us at Excelsior as the Liquor Store WILL BE CROWDED and finding new faces becomes difficult.  There is a small cover at Liquor Store, but a long line will start forming shortly after 9:15pm, so even more reason to meet with the group early.  Give me a call if you need help with directions or finding the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My picture is on this site, when you see the group, just introduce yourself and say you are a friend of Charlie. If your picture is up on the site, do RVSP and I'll look for you as well. My phone is 646.541.0708.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excelsior and Liquor Store are upscale scenes, so please dress appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there!
