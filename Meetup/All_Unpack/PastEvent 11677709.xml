The venue is exquisite, spectacular and very unique.  Sadly, there was a huge &amp;quot;no show&amp;quot; list but a party of five  had a fun evening anyway!  Candace worked with the resturant and they were very  flexible and accomodated our smaller party.   Yup it is Cambridge, parking challenges and such.  But in what other location could this be a better fit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Only RSVP if you think you can attend.  The $2 PayPal fee option to RSVP will run until December 1st.  Let's try to avoid last minute cancellations - okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details - here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuchi Cuchi (don't you love the name?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On July 26, 2001, &lt;b&gt;Tamara Bourso and Fernanda da Silva&lt;/b&gt; opened Cuchi Cuchi.  The space at &lt;b&gt;795 Main Street&lt;/b&gt; in Cambridge was extensively redesigned to personify the age of Old World Beauty and early Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please join us for this unique experience!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Diana</member_name><member_id>7792036</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1260056243000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>3</count></rating><group><who>Baby Boomers</who><join_mode>approval</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun</urlname><id>1347228</id><group_lat>42.3499984741</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0699996948</group_lon><name>Boston Baby Boomers Meetup Group-Social Fun</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>13</yes_rsvp_count><created>1256135669000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Thursday Night Cultural Dining - Second Time</name><id>11677709</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1259883000000</time><rsvp_limit>22</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Baby-Boomers-Meetup-Group-Social-Fun/events/11677709/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/e/global_10656542.jpeg</photo_url></item>
