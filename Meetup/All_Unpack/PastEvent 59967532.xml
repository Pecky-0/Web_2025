&lt;p&gt;Hike the entire Skyline Trail from Canton to Quincy. Should take about 3 to 4hours and is approx 8 miles. YeeHaaawwwww! We will start at the parking area near the Dunkin Donuts on Rte 138 then end at Shea Rink in Quincy.&amp;nbsp; Since this is an end to end hike, we will need to setup some carpooling. There is another hike scheduled for the return trip from Quincy to Canton following this hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!! You DO NOT have to RSVP that you are not attending. This only fills up my mailbox. Thanks &lt;br /&gt;
