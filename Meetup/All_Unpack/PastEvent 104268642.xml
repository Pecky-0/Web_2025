&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color : #222222"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;03/20 UPDATE: We are going to meet on the Warren (east) side of the mountains instead of the Lincoln (west) side since there is better sledding on the east side. The new plan is to meet at the Warren General Store located at 284 Main Street in Warren, VT. According to Google Maps the meeting spot is 189 miles from Boston and should take about 3 hours 21 minutes to drive there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;Read the entire description before you RSVP and answer all questions that are part of the RSVP. Failure to answer them will result in your removal from this event.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;If you RSVP from a mobile device the questions may not show up - be sure to use a computer to update your RSVP so you can answer them (go back to the event page, click change "RSVP", click "YES", then answer them.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;span style="color : #ff0000"&gt;Your safety, and the safety of the group, is the most important thing. If you underestimate the demands of this event; overestimate your experience, knowledge, skills or abilities; or come unprepared you put yourself or others at risk – consider this before you decide to participate.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;This is a combined trip with the AMC (Appalachian Mountain Club). The AMC requires a signed liability waiver for participation so ALL participants will need to read the waiver (read it by &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/492954/AMC%20Liability%20Release.pdf"&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;) before you arrive and sign it at the trailhead in order to participate.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ===== &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;What we're doing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Join us for hiking and sledding in the Green Mountains of Vermont. We’ll ascend Mt. Ellen (4,083’) and Mt. Abraham (4,006’) (both NE 4k mountains) from the Jerusalem Trail in Jerusalem, VT and continue south down the Long Trail. Along the way we’ll also go over Cutts Peak (4,022’), Nancy Hanks Peak (3,812’) and Lincoln Peak (3,975’) and will end at Lincoln Gap where, if there’s enough snow, we’ll sled down Lincoln Gap road. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This hike will be 10.5 miles (potentially a little more if there is not enough snow for sledding), and will gain ~2,200’ in elevation. We will be below treeline for most of the hike except for the ridge approaching Mt. Ellen and the summit of Mt. Abraham where, weather permitting, there will be sweeping views of the Green Mountains. &lt;br /&gt;

 ===== &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;What to bring&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Be sure to look at the gear information listed below - you will need things like warm layers, wind protection, goggles, snow shoes, and traction. I will update everyone if weather conditions dictate that we bring more than what is described here. If you don't know what to wear and/or bring with you or have any questions contact me. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 • &lt;a href="http://files.meetup.com/492954/Winter_Day_Hike_Clothing_and_Gear_List.pdf"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for a list of items needed for a winter day hike &lt;br /&gt;

 • In addition to this list, please bring a sled that you are comfortable carrying in addition to your gear on the hike. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Do not rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or on the trail. If you don't have the required items you put yourself and everyone else at risk. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ===== &lt;br /&gt;

 Trip Summary &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. This trip isn't for you if you are faster than the group and don't want to stay with us, if you want to head off on your own, or if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 On this &lt;strong&gt;moderate pace (~1.5 MPH)&lt;/strong&gt; out and back trip we will &lt;strong&gt;hike about 10.6 miles&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;climb about 2,200 feet&lt;/strong&gt;. It should take an average hiker &lt;strong&gt;about 9 hours to complete this trip&lt;/strong&gt; (this does not include time for rest breaks). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 This event is considered to be &lt;strong&gt;Intermediate&lt;/strong&gt; because of the pace, distance, and elevation gain. We could alter our plans because of fatigue, weather, and/or other conditions and there is no guarantee that we will complete the entire event as described here (i.e. we might not reach the summit). &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 I did my research using the Green Mountain Club's "Long Trail Guide", a trail map, and the Internet. You need to become self-reliant by becoming familiar with the route, and terrain. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ===== &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Mountain weather is subject to rapid changes and extreme conditions. Dangerous weather conditions will cancel - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants a day or two ahead of time. We will assess travel and weather conditions during the hike and make changes to our planned trip as necessary. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ===== &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 We will meet at the Lincoln General Store in Lincoln, VT (the address is 17 East River Road, Lincoln, VT 05443). Since this is where we will finish we will leave a few cars here and then circle back to the where we will start the hike on Dwire Road. According to Google Maps this spot is about 195 miles from Boston and it should take about 3 hours 45 minutes to drive there. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 While carpooling is encouraged you are responsible for coordinating your own rides. Use the comments section below to communicate with others who may also be looking to share a ride. If you do share a ride be sure to share the expenses - suggested donations per person are $25 from Boston MA, $20 from Salem/Nashua NH, and $10 from Concord NH. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 ==== &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Sledding&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Check out this video of sledding down Lincoln Gap road to know what to see what’s in store: &lt;a class="linkified" href="http://www.easternslopes.com/2012/03/16/sledding-the-gap-free-winter-fun-in-vermont/"&gt;http://www.easternslopes.com/2012/03/16/sledding-the-gap-free-winter-fun-in-vermont/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 If you don’t bring a sled you will miss out on the fun. The most popular choices are: &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 • Zipfy Sled - &lt;a&gt;http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3655510&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 • Slidy Sled - &lt;a&gt;http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4450226&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 Be sure to have a way to secure your sled to your pack for the snow shoe up and your snow shoes to your pack for the sled down. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 If you want to sled on this trip you should bring a helmet - sections of the road are steep so the speeds could be fast. Here is some information about helmets. &lt;br /&gt;

 The US Consumer Product Safety Commission publishes a pamphlet titled "Which Helmet for Which Activity" which provides useful information covering a broad range of helmets. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;

 While there isn't a helmet specifically designed for sledding, they recommend that wearing a ski helmet (ASTM F2040; CEN 1077; Snell RS-98 or S-98). If you don't have one of these a bicycle helmet (ASTM F1447; Snell B-90/95 or N-94) or a skateboard helmet (ASTM F1492; Snell N-94) is preferable to wearing no helmet at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color : #000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
