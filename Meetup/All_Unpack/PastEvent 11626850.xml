If we accept into our being the reality of God’s goodness, love, and caring for us, then the natural result of that would be to trust our lives to God’s care. People are easily distracted by things that seem hard or inconvenient and tend to label these things as ‘bad’ or as a ‘problem’. What if all things ‘good’ and ‘bad’ are just God trying to tell us something about life? Come and begin a journey into the reality of God’s love and the perfect care God takes of each person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.CentersOfLight.org&lt;br /&gt;</description><how_to_find_us>We're just around the corner from the Stony Brook T-stop on the orange line.</how_to_find_us><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1258936966000</updated><rating><average>0.0</average><count>0</count></rating><group><who>Mystics</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>spiritual-mystic</urlname><id>302540</id><group_lat>42.3699989319</group_lat><group_lon>-71.0800018311</group_lon><name>Spirituality &amp; Mysticism Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>6</yes_rsvp_count><created>1255546063000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Seminar:  You Don't Have Any Problems</name><id>11626850</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-18000000</utc_offset><time>1258763400000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/spiritual-mystic/events/11626850/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/4/global_4477444.jpeg</photo_url></item>
