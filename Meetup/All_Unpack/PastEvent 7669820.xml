Sample the Upper Valley?s cheeses, honey, herbs, cider, maple syrup and more! Watch demonstrations of crafts; take a horse-drawn wagon ride! See locally bred animals and participate in special events scheduled throughout the day. Many booths and activities will be held in the Museum?s historic buildings, so this event will be held rain or shine. Take a break in the Great Stone Dwelling for lunch and musical performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Museum:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nestled in a valley between Mt. Assurance and Mascoma Lake, in Enfield, New Hampshire, the Enfield Shaker site has been cherished for over 200 years. At its peak in the mid 19th century, the community was home to three &amp;quot;Families&amp;quot; of Shakers. They practiced equality of the sexes and races, celibacy, pacifism and communal ownership of property. Shakers farmed over 3,000 acres of land, educated children in model schools and worshipped in the &amp;quot;Shaker Way.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mission of the Enfield Shaker Museum, a not-for-profit educational institution, is to foster public knowledge and understanding of the cultural, religious, and economic history of New England by interpreting the complex and multi-faceted site settled by the Enfield Shakers. The Museum collects, preserves, and interprets the buildings, material culture, and landscapes produced and used both by the Shakers and by the Missionaries of La Salette. Through collections, research facilities, exhibits, and public programs, the Museum promotes discussion of the great existential questions of human life including community, spirituality, creativity, and economic activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shakermuseum.org/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.shakermuse...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Enfield Shaker Museum is located on Route 4-A in Enfield, New Hampshire (12 miles southeast of Hanover, N.H.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Exit 17 off I-89.
