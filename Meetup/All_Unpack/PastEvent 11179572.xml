Want to meet other members?  Want to have a few laughs?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join us at the driving range on Tunxis Fore.  It's a nice driving range and pretty easy to get to.  Grab a bucket of balls and look for me and the other members attending.  The address is listed above.  Note, it's &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; at Tunxis Golf Course.  I made that mistake last year.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the driving range we'll head over to the Wood n Tap restaurant in Farmington.  Even if you can't make it to the driving range, feel free to meet us at the restaurant.  It's a great way to get to know the other members and trade some golf stories.  We can also talk about what other types of events to post in the future.  Other golf courses?  A scramble?  Lessons?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to reach me, I'm at 203-812-0705.&lt;br /&gt;***We will be accepting donations towards the cost of maintaining this site.  The next payment of $72.00 is due on Sept. 2 to avoid any interruption in service.  Thank You!!&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Karen</member_name><member_id>3461529</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>2</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1251661168000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>Golfers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>CentralCTGolf</urlname><id>1040754</id><group_lat>41.6100006104</group_lat><group_lon>-72.7699966431</group_lon><name>The Central CT  Golf Meetup</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>5</yes_rsvp_count><created>1251054659000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Driving Range and Dinner/Drinks</name><id>11179572</id><headcount>6</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1251325800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/CentralCTGolf/events/11179572/</event_url><photo_url>http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/2/2/global_9650850.jpeg</photo_url></item>
