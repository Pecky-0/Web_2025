It has become apparent that our softball team activites are not wanted here.  I planned to post practices for everyone to come out and just have fun.  That is not going to work.  If anyone wants to keep updated when I will be hosting softball related events for people to come out and play please email or call me.  We will be having weekly practices/scrimmage games through out the spring, summer, and fall.  Having said that Sat looks to be a lovely day to take the field.  My contact info is 203 525 5670 and chrisd4@earthlink.net.  Peace from Chris on the other softball team not in any way related to the NHC if there was any confusion.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Devorah, AJ, &amp; Jason</member_name><member_id>3217243</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>6</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1175530030000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>NHC'ers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>New-Haven-Collective</urlname><id>211163</id><group_lat>41.3300018311</group_lat><group_lon>-72.9400024414</group_lon><name>The New Haven Collective</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>9</yes_rsvp_count><created>1174965419000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Come playball again</name><id>5608688</id><headcount>12</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1175356800000</time><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/New-Haven-Collective/events/5608688/</event_url></item>
