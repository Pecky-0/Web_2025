So, come join us for a very light book and delicious Nepalese dishes. Try the Mojitos while you're there. They are spectacular!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 person cap applies as usual and remember to update your RSVP if it turns out you won't be able to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Jason Lambert</member_name><member_id>3148632</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>0</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1306420244000</updated><rating><average>5.0</average><count>1</count></rating><why>What else are you going to do on a Wednesday night?
