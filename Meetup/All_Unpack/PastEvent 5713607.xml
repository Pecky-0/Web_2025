<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>	<item><status>past</status><description>Since 1626, when Roger Conant arrived with the first settlers, Salem, Massachusetts has been attracting people from all points of the compass. Many come to visit and some decide to stay and make Salem their home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be most widely known as the site of the Salem witchcraft trials of 1692, but this colorful, coastal city has much to offer both residents and visitors: a culturally diverse population, a rich maritime heritage, an impressive display of historic architecture and amazing stories that span almost four centuries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll meet in front of the Salem's Visitor Center at 11:00 and walk around Salem and follow the Heritage Trail.  We'll see some of the important spots of Salem's history including the Witch Trial's.  Afterwards we'll have lunch at the In a Pig's Eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inapigseye.com/" target="_blank"&gt;In a Pig's Eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;148 Derby Street&lt;br /&gt;Salem, MA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><event_hosts><event_hosts_item><member_name>Greg</member_name><member_id>2750937</member_id></event_hosts_item></event_hosts><maybe_rsvp_count>4</maybe_rsvp_count><waitlist_count>0</waitlist_count><updated>1179846513000</updated><rating><average>4.75</average><count>4</count></rating><group><who>social walkers</who><join_mode>open</join_mode><urlname>Boston-Walking</urlname><id>341292</id><group_lat>42.3400001526</group_lat><group_lon>-71.1200027466</group_lon><name>The Boston Walking Meetup Group</name></group><yes_rsvp_count>12</yes_rsvp_count><created>1177626625000</created><visibility>public</visibility><name>Salem Heritage Trail</name><id>5713607</id><headcount>8</headcount><utc_offset>-14400000</utc_offset><time>1179673200000</time><rsvp_limit>20</rsvp_limit><event_url>http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/5713607/</event_url></item>
